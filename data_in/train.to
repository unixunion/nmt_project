One word , good citizens .
Where is the Earl
Tell thou the Earl That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here .
For this relief much thanks . Tis bitter cold , And I am sick at heart .
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury
This matched with other did , my gracious lord . For more uneven and unwelcome news Came from the north and thus it did import On Holy rood Day , the gallant Hotspur there , Young Harry Percy , and brave Archibald , That ever valiant and approvèd Scot , At Holmedon met , where they did spend A sad and bloody hour As by discharge of their artillery And shape of likelihood the news was told For he that brought them , in the very heat And pride of their contention did take horse , Uncertain of the issue any way .
What , boy
Sweet masters , be patient . For your father’s remembrance , be at accord .
If I must not , I need not be barren of accusations he hath faults , with surplus , to tire in repetition .
My lord , I’ll tell you what If my young lord your son have not the day , Upon mine honor , for a silken point I’ll give my barony . Never talk of it .
Who , he He was some hilding fellow that had stolen The horse he rode on and , upon my life , Spoke at a venture . Look , here comes more news .
Yea , there thou mak’st me sad , and mak’st me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son , A son who is the theme of Honor’s tongue , Amongst a grove the very straightest plant , Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride Whilst I , by looking on the praise of him , See riot and dishonor stain the brow Of my young Harry . O , that it could be proved That some night tripping fairy had exchanged In cradle clothes our children where they lay , And called mine Percy , his Plantagenet Then would I have his Harry , and he mine . But let him from my thoughts . What think you , coz , Of this young Percy’s pride The prisoners , Which he in this adventure hath surprised To his own use he keeps , and sends me word I shall have none but Mordake , Earl of Fife .
Calls your Worship
Oh , no , for the duke’s daughter her cousin so loves her , being ever from their cradles bred together , that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her . She is at the court , and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter , and never two ladies loved as they do .
How doth my son and brother Thou tremblest , and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand . Even such a man , so faint , so spiritless , So dull , so dead in look , so woebegone , Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night , And would have told him half his Troy was burnt But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue , And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it . This thou wouldst say , Your son did thus and thus Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds . But in the end , to stop my ear indeed , Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise , Ending with Brother , son , and all are dead .
What , you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke
Barnardo has my place . Give you good night .
A piece of him .
Tush , tush , ’twill not appear .
Soothsayer
Good sir , give me good fortune .
My youngest boy , and yet my eldest care , At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother , and importuned me That his attendant–so his case was like ,
I pray thee , Rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee . If my uncle , thy banished father , had banished thy uncle , the duke my father , so thou hadst been still with me , I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine . So wouldst thou , if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee .
Most like . It harrows me with fear and wonder .
To feed contention in a lingering act But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain Reign in all bosoms , that , each heart being set On bloody courses , the rude scene may end , And darkness be the burier of the dead .
Sweet Earl , divorce not wisdom from your honor . The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health , the which , if you give o er To stormy passion , must perforce decay . You cast th event of war , my noble lord , And summed the account of chance before you said Let us make head . It was your presurmise That , in the dole of blows your son might drop . You knew he walked o er perils on an edge , More likely to fall in than to get o er . You were advised his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars , and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged . Yet did you say Go forth , and none of this , Though strongly apprehended , could restrain The stiff borne action . What hath then befall n , Or what did this bold enterprise brought forth , More than that being which was like to be
Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither , but Nature’s , who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses , and hath sent this natural for our whetstone , for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits . How now , wit , whither wander you
Mistress , you must come away to your father .
Where learned you that oath , fool
Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend , But to procrastinate his lifeless end .
By our beards , thou art .
By my knavery , then I were . But if you swear by that that is not , you are not forsworn . No more was this knight swearing by his honor , for he never had any or if he had , he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard .
My father’s love is enough to honor him . Enough . Speak no more of him you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
Thou art so fat witted , with drinking of old sack , and unbuttoning thee after supper , and sleeping upon benches after noon , that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know . What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day Unless hours were cups of sack , and minutes capons , and clocks the tongues of bawds , and dials the signs of leaping houses , and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame colored taffeta , I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day .
Your belly’s answer What The kingly crowned head , the vigilant eye , The counsellor heart , the arm our soldier , Our steed the leg , the tongue our trumpeter . With other muniments and petty helps In this our fabric , if that they
What then ’Fore me , this fellow speaks What then what then
E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine .
But how , but how Give me particulars .
Not in my husband’s nose .
But , my good lord , How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the Commons Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no
‘Though all at once cannot See what I do deliver out to each , Yet I can make my audit up , that all From me do back receive the flour of all , And leave me but the bran . ’ What say you to’t
How did this offer seem received , my lord
Or I , I promise thee .
Before my God , I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes .
The senators of Rome are this good belly , And you the mutinous members for examine Their counsels and their cares , digest things rightly Touching the weal o’ the common , you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you And no way from yourselves . What do you think , You , the great toe of this assembly
Sir , here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph .
Amen .
Hush Here comes Antony .
Boy , tell him I am deaf .
Saw you my lord
No , lady .
Seek him and bring him hither . Where’s Alexas
For corn at their own rates whereof , they say , The city is well stored .
I attend them with all respect and duty .
With good acceptance of his Majesty Save that there was not time enough to hear , As I perceived his Grace would fain have done , The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms , And generally to the crown and seat of France , Derived from Edward , his great grandfather .
It is .
Sir John Falstaff , a word with you .
Sir John , I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury .
Ready , sir but his will hath in it a more modest working .
No , I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
They have a leader , Tullus Aufidius , that will put you to ’t . I sin in envying his nobility , And were I any thing but what I am , I would wish me only he .
Well , what worst
The nature of bad news infects the teller .
Yea , and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent But I prithee , sweet wag , shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king And resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law Do not thou , when thou art king , hang a thief .
Labienus This is stiff news hath with his Parthian force Extended Asia from Euphrates His conquering banner shook , from Syria To Lydia and to Ionia , Whilst
I think you are fallen into the disease , for you hear not what I say to you .
Not yet , my cousin . We would be resolved , Before we hear him , of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France .
Were I my father , coz , would I do this
Stop in your wind , sir . Tell me this , I pray Where have you left the money that I gave you
To me , sir Why , you gave no gold to me
You have fought together .
Under a compelling occasion , let women die . It were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing . Cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly . I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment . I do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
Tis here .
Lord of the wide world and wild wat ry seas , Endued with intellectual sense and souls , Of more preeminence than fish and fowls , Are masters to their females , and their lords . Then let your will attend on their accords .
There is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravity .
His effect of gravy , gravy , gravy .
Then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning
a decreasing leg , an increasing belly Is not your voice broken , your wind short , your chin double , your wit single , and every part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call yourself young Fie , fie , fie , Sir John .
God send the companion a better prince . I cannot rid my hands of him .
Our army’s in the field We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready To answer us .
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only , But fear the main intendment of the Scot , Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us . For you shall read that my great grandfather Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom Came pouring like the tide into a breach With ample and brim fullness of his force , Galling the gleanèd land with hot assays , Girding with grievous siege castles and towns , That England , being empty of defense , Hath shook and trembled at th ill neighborhood .
You will , chops
Why , that’s well said .
By the Lord , I’ll be a traitor then when thou art king .
Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him .
Help me away , dear Charmian I shall fall . It cannot be thus long . The sides of nature Will not sustain it .
Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted .
O , doubt not that I speak from certainties . Nay , more , Some parcels of their power are forth already , And only hitherward . I leave your honours . If we and Caius Martius chance to meet , ’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more .
And keep your honours safe
Seven groats and two pence .
I did not then entreat to have her stay . It was your pleasure and your own remorse . I was too young that time to value her , But now I know her . If she be a traitor , Why so am I . We still have slept together , Rose at an instant , learned , played , eat together , And , wheresoe er we went , like Juno’s swans Still we went coupled and inseparable .
You are a fool . You , niece , provide yourself . If you outstay the time , upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word , you die .
O most false love Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water Now I see , I see , In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be .
Quarrel no more , but be prepared to know The purposes I bear , which are or cease As you shall give th’ advice . By the fire That quickens Nilus’ slime , I go from hence Thy soldier , servant , making peace or war As thou affects .
Hence , prating peasant Fetch thy master home .
Am I so round with you as you with me , That like a football you do spurn me thus You spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither . If I last in this service , you must case me in leather .
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
How shall we part with them in setting forth
Yea , marry , there’s the point . But if without him we be thought too feeble , My judgment is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand . For in a theme so bloody faced as this , Conjecture , expectation , and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted .
I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page , And therefore look you call me Ganymede . But what will you be called
Farewell , my lord .
Have you your father’s leave What says Polonius
Farewell , my lord . What you shall know meantime Of stirs abroad , I shall beseech you , sir , To let me be partaker .
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away .
Yes , gracious madam .
Indeed
His bloody brow O Jupiter , no blood
Away , you fool it more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy the breasts of Hecuba , When she did suckle Hector , look’d not lovelier Than Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood At Grecian sword , contemning . Tell Valeria , We are fit to bid her welcome .
Oh , that brave Caesar
And did you leave him in this contemplation
Can it be possible that no man saw them It cannot be . Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this .
My lord , the roinish clown , at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh , is also missing . Hisperia , the Princess gentlewoman , Confesses that she secretly o erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles , And she believes wherever they are gone That youth is surely in their company .
Send to his brother . Fetch that gallant hither . If he be absent , bring his brother to me . I’ll make him find him . Do this suddenly , And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways .
From Silvius , sir .
I pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student . I think it was to see my mother’s wedding .
The circumstance considered , good my lord , Whate er Lord Harry Percy then had said To such a person and in such a place , At such a time , with all the rest retold , May reasonably die and never rise To do him wrong or any way impeach What then he said , so he unsay it now .
I will wish her speedy strength , and visit her with my prayers but I cannot go thither .
Verily , I do not jest with you there came news from him last night .
Hold , sir , for God’s sake Now your jest is earnest . Upon what bargain do you give it me
I do not know , Maecenas . Ask Agrippa .
But where was this
Grant that our hopes , yet likely of fair birth , Should be stillborn and that we now possessed The utmost man of expectation , I think we are a body strong enough , Even as we are , to equal with the King .
Well , this is the Forest of Arden .
Ay , be so , good Touchstone .
My being in Egypt , Caesar , what was ’t to you
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt . Yet if you there Did practice on my state , your being in Egypt Might be my question .
Would we had all such wives , that the men might go to wars with the women
Sir , He fell upon me ere admitted , then . Three kings I had newly feasted , and did want Of what I was i’ th’ morning . But next day I told him of myself , which was as much As to have asked him pardon . Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife . If we contend , Out of our question wipe him .
That is the way to make her scorn you still .
O Corin , that thou knew’st how I do love her
I partly guess , for I have loved ere now .
No , Corin , being old , thou canst not guess , Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow . But if thy love were ever like to mine As sure I think did never man love so How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
Tis very strange .
Into a thousand that I have forgotten .
Oh , thou didst then ne er love so heartily . If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into , Thou hast not loved . Or if thou hast not sat as I do now , Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise , Thou hast not loved . Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly , as my passion now makes me , Thou hast not loved . O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe
As I do live , my honored lord , ’tis true . And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it .
Alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , I have by hard adventure found mine own .
Indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me . Hold you the watch tonight
Yonder comes news . A wager they have met .
My horse to yours , no .
’Tis done .
Agreed .
Say , has our general met the enemy
Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton . Linger your patience on , and we’ll digest Th abuse of distance , force a play . The sum is paid , the traitors are agreed , The king is set from London , and the scene Is now transported , gentles , to Southampton . There is the playhouse now , there must you sit , And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back , charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass for , if we may , We’ll not offend one stomach with our play . But , till the king come forth , and not till then , Unto Southampton do we shift our scene .
They lie in view but have not spoke as yet .
So , the good horse is mine .
I’ll buy him of you .
You have broken The article of your oath , which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with .
No , I’ll nor sell nor give him lend you him I will For half a hundred years . Summon the town .
Soft , Caesar .
How far off lie these armies
No , Lepidus , let him speak . The honor is sacred which he talks on now , Supposing that I lacked it . But , on , Caesar . The article of my oath
Within this mile and half .
To lend me arms and aid when I required them , The which you both denied .
Then shall we hear their ’larum , and they ours . Now , Mars , I prithee , make us quick in work , That we with smoking swords may march from hence , To help our fielded friends Come , blow thy blast .
Neglected , rather , And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge . As nearly as I may I’ll play the penitent to you , but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power Work without it . Truth is that Fulvia , To have me out of Egypt , made wars here , For which myself , the ignorant motive , do So far ask pardon as befits mine honor To stoop in such a case .
Tutus Aufidius , is he within your walls
’Tis noble spoken .
No , nor a man that fears you less than he , That’s lesser than a little .
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye , to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you .
The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland Against the Welsh , himself and Harry Monmouth But who is substituted against the French I have no certain notice .
Why first for flouting me and then wherefore for urging it the second time to me .
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season , When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason Well , sir , I thank you .
Thank me , sir , for what
Let us on , And publish the occasion of our arms . The commonwealth is sick of their own choice . Their over greedy love hath surfeited . An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart . O thou fond many , with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke Before he was what thou wouldst have him be . And being now trimmed in thine own desires , Thou , beastly feeder , art so full of him That thou provok’st thyself to cast him up . So , so , thou common dog , didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard , And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up And howl’st to find it . What trust is in these times They that , when Richard lived , would have him die Are now become enamored on his grave . Thou , that threw’st dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th admired heels of Bolingbroke , Criest now O earth , yield us that King again , And take thou this O thoughts of men accursed Past and to come seems best things present , worst .
Marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
Shall we go draw our numbers and set on
I’ll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something . But say , sir , is it dinnertime
We are time’s subjects , and time bids begone .
No , sir , I think the meat wants that I have .
In good time , sir , what’s that
Basting .
Well , sir , then ’twill be dry .
If it be , sir , I pray you , eat none of it .
Your reason
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
We do , my lord .
Well , sir , learn to jest in good time . There’s a time for all things .
Armed , say you
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric .
Armed , my lord .
From top to toe
My lord , from head to foot .
Then saw you not his face
Oh yes , my lord . He wore his beaver up .
I cannot blame him . Was not he proclaimed By Richard , that dead is , the next of blood
Worthily spoken , Maecenas .
He was I heard the proclamation . And then it was when the unhappy King Whose wrongs in us God pardon did set forth Upon his Irish expedition From whence he , intercepted , did return To be deposed and shortly murderèd .
Or , if you borrow one another’s love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of Pompey , return it again . You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth Live scandalized and foully spoken of .
Thou art a soldier only . Speak no more .
But soft , I pray you . Did King Richard then Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer Heir to the crown
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot .
He did myself did hear it .
You wrong this presence . Therefore speak no more .
Go to , then . Your considerate stone .
Nay then , I cannot blame his cousin King That wished him on the barren mountains starve . But shall it be that you that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man And for his sake wear the detested blot Of murderous subornation shall it be That you a world of curses undergo , Being the agents or base second means , The cords , the ladder , or the hangman rather O , pardon me that I descend so low To show the line and the predicament Wherein you range under this subtle King . Shall it for shame be spoken in these days , Or fill up chronicles in time to come , That men of your nobility and power
I do not much dislike the matter , but The manner of his speech , for ’t cannot be We shall remain in friendship , our conditions So diff’ring in their acts . Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch , from edge to edge O’ th’ world I would pursue it .
Give me leave , Caesar .
Speak , Agrippa .
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side , Admired Octavia . Great Mark Antony Is now a widower .
Say not so , Agrippa . If Cleopatra heard you , your reproof Were well deserved of rashness .
Well met , Corporal Nym .
Good morrow , Lieutenant Bardolph .
I am not married , Caesar . Let me hear Agrippa further speak .
What , are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet
For my part , I care not . I say little , but when time shall serve , there shall be smiles but that shall be as it may . I dare not fight , but I will wink and hold out mine iron . It is a simple one , but what though It will toast cheese , and it will endure cold as another man’s sword will , and there’s an end .
To hold you in perpetual amity , To make you brothers , and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot , take Antony Octavia to his wife , whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men , Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter . By this marriage , All little jealousies , which now seem great , And all great fears , which now import their dangers , Would then be nothing . Truths would be tales , Where now half tales be truths . Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her . Pardon what I have spoke , For ’tis a studied , not a present thought , By duty ruminated .
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends and we’ll be all three sworn brothers to France . Let ’t be so , good Corporal Nym .
Will Caesar speak
Faith , I will live so long as I may , that’s the certain of it . And when I cannot live any longer , I will do as I may . That is my rest that is the rendezvous of it .
Not till he hears how Antony is touched With what is spoke already .
It is certain , corporal , that he is married to Nell Quickly , and certainly she did you wrong , for you were troth plight to her .
What power is in Agrippa If I would say , Agrippa , be it so , To make this good
I cannot tell . Things must be as they may . Men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges . It must be as it may . Though patience be a tired mare , yet she will plod . There must be conclusions . Well , I cannot tell .
By what rule , sir
Master Fang , have you entered the action
And I mine . I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a night to Jane Smile . And I remember the kissing of her batler , and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked . And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom I took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears , Wear these for my sake . We that are true lovers run into strange capers . But as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
Marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself .
It is entered .
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of .
Where’s your yeoman Is ’t a lusty yeoman Will a stand to ’t
Let’s hear it .
Nay , I shall ne er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it .
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
Jove , Jove , this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion .
May he not do it by fine and recovery
Sirrah Where’s Snare
And mine , but it grows something stale with me .
The power of Caesar , and His power unto Octavia .
Yes , to pay a fine for a periwig , and recover the lost hair of another man .
O Lord , ay , good Master Snare .
I pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food . I faint almost to death .
Why is Time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement
May I never To this good purpose , that so fairly shows , Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand Further this act of grace , and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs
Here , here .
Holla , you clown
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts , and what he hath scanted men in hair , he hath given them in wit .
Snare , we must arrest Sir John Falstaff .
There’s my hand .
Peace , fool . He’s not thy kinsman .
Yea , good Master Snare , I have entered him and all .
Why , but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit .
Who calls
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly . Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never Fly off our loves again
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair .
It may chance cost some of us our lives , for he will stab .
Your betters , sir .
Why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
Happily , amen
Alas the day , take heed of him . He stabbed me in mine own house , and that most beastly , in good faith . He cares not what mischief he does . If his weapon be out , he will foin like any devil . He will spare neither man , woman , nor child .
Else are they very wretched .
If I can close with him , I care not for his thrust .
I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey , For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me . I must thank him only , Lest my remembrance suffer ill report At heel of that , defy him .
Time calls upon ’s . Of us must Pompey presently be sought , Or else he seeks out us .
Where lies he
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf To put down Richard , that sweet lovely rose , An plant this thorn , this canker , Bolingbroke And shall it in more shame be further spoken That you are fooled , discarded , and shook off By him for whom these shames you underwent No , yet time serves wherein you may redeem Your banished honors and restore yourselves Into the good thoughts of the world again , Revenge the jeering and disdain’d contempt Of this proud King , who studies day and night To answer all the debt he owes to you Even with the bloody payment of your deaths . Therefore I say
About the Mount Misena .
What is his strength by land
Peace , cousin , say no more . And now I will unclasp a secret book , And to your quick conceiving discontents I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous , As full of peril and adventurous spirit As to o erwalk a current roaring loud On the unsteadfast footing of a spear .
Great and increasing . But by sea he is an absolute master .
If he fall in , good night , or sink or swim Send danger from the east unto the west , So honor cross it from the north to south , And let them grapple O , the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare
So is the fame . Would we had spoke together Haste we for it . Yet , ere we put ourselves in arms , dispatch we The business we have talked of .
Imagination of some great exploit Drives him beyond the bounds of patience .
With most gladness , And do invite you to my sister’s view , Whither straight I’ll lead you .
Let us , Lepidus , not lack your company .
By heaven , methinks it were an easy leap To pluck bright honor from the pale faced moon , Or dive into the bottom of the deep , Where fathom line could never touch the ground , And pluck up drownèd honor by the locks , So he that doth redeem her thence might wear Without corrival all her dignities . But out upon this half faced fellowship
Noble Antony , not sickness should detain me .
Welcome from Egypt , sir .
Half the heart of Caesar , worthy Maecenas My honorable friend , Agrippa .
Good Enobarbus
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife . Good corporal , be patient here . How now , mine host Pistol
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested . You stayed well by ’t in Egypt .
Base tyke , call’st thou me host Now , by this hand , I swear , I scorn the term , Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers .
Ay , sir , we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking .
No , by my troth , not long , for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight .
Oh , well a day , Lady If he be not hewn now , we shall see willful adultery and murder committed .
Good lieutenant , good corporal , offer nothing here .
Pish
Pish for thee , Iceland dog , Thou prick eared cur of Iceland
Good Corporal Nym , show thy valor and put up your sword .
Will you shog off I would have you solus .
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there Is this true
What , looked he frowningly
This was but as a fly by an eagle . We had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
A countenance more In sorrow than in anger .
She’s a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
Pale or red
When she first met Mark Antony , she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus .
Nay , very pale .
There she appeared indeed , or my reporter devised well for her .
And fixed his eyes upon you
Most constantly .
The plainer dealer , the sooner lost . Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity .
I would I had been there .
I will tell you . The barge she sat in , like a burnished throne , Burned on the water . The poop was beaten gold , Purple the sails , and so perfumèd that The winds were lovesick with them . The oars were silver , Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made The water which they beat to follow faster , As amorous of their strokes . For her own person , It beggared all description she did lie In her pavilion cloth of gold , of tissue O’erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature . On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling Cupids , With divers colored fans , whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , And what they undid did .
For what reason
It would have much amazed you .
For two , and sound ones too .
Very like . Stayed it long
Nay , not sound , I pray you .
Hark our drums Are bringing forth our youth . We’ll break our walls , Rather than they shall pound us up our gates , Which yet seem shut , we , have but pinn’d with rushes They’ll open of themselves .
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
Sure ones , then .
Nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
Longer , longer .
Certain ones , then .
Not when I saw ’t .
Name them .
His beard was grizzled , no
The one , to save the money that he spends in tiring the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
It was , as I have seen it in his life , A sable silvered .
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
I will watch tonight . Perchance Twill walk again .
Marry , and did , sir namely , e en no time to recover hair lost by nature .
I warrant it will .
Oh , rare for Antony
Her gentlewomen , like the Nereides , So many mermaids , tended her i’ th’ eyes , And made their bends adornings . At the helm A seeming mermaid steers . The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower soft hands That yarely frame the office . From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs . The city cast Her people out upon her , and Antony , Enthroned i’ th’ marketplace , did sit alone , Whistling to th’ air , which , but for vacancy , Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too And made a gap in nature .
Rare Egyptian
Peace , I say . Good even to you , friend .
And to you , gentle sir , and to you all .
Upon her landing , Antony sent to her , Invited her to supper . She replied It should be better he became her guest , Which she entreated . Our courteous Antony , Whom ne’er the word of No woman heard speak , Being barbered ten times o’er , goes to the feast , And for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat only .
I prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment , Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed . Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed , And faints for succor .
Fair sir , I pity her And wish , for her sake more than for mine own , My fortunes were more able to relieve her . But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze . My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality . Besides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed Are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , By reason of his absence , there is nothing That you will feed on . But what is , come see , And in my voice most welcome shall you be .
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile , That little cares for buying anything .
I pray thee , if it stand with honesty , Buy thou the cottage , pasture , and the flock , And thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
Solus , egregious dog O viper vile , The solus in thy most marvelous face , The solus in thy teeth and in thy throat And in thy hateful lungs , yea , in thy maw , perdy , And , which is worse , within thy nasty mouth I do retort the solus in thy bowels , For I can take , and Pistol’s cock is up , And flashing fire will follow .
I am not Barbason you cannot conjure me . I have an humor to knock you indifferently well . If you grow foul with me , Pistol , I will scour you with my rapier , as I may , in fair terms . If you would walk off , I would prick your guts a little in good terms , as I may , and that’s the humor of it .
O braggart vile and damnèd furious wight , The grave doth gape , and doting death is near . Therefore exhale .
Hear me , hear me what I say he that strikes the first stroke , I’ll run him up to the hilts , as I am a soldier .
An oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate . Give me thy fist , thy forefoot to me give . Thy spirits are most tall .
I will cut thy throat one time or other in fair terms , that is the humor of it .
Couple à gorge , that is the word . I defy thee again . O hound of Crete , think’st thou my spouse to get No , to the spital go , And from the powd ring tub of infamy Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid’s kind , Doll Tearsheet she by name , and her espouse .
Hark you , far off There is Aufidius list , what work he makes Amongst your cloven army .
O , they are at it
Their noise be our instruction . Ladders , ho
Royal wench She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed . He plowed her , and she cropped .
They fear us not , but issue forth their city . Now put your shields before your hearts , and fight With hearts more proof than shields . Advance , brave Titus They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts , Which makes me sweat with wrath . Come on , my fellows He that retires I’ll take him for a Volsce , And he shall feel mine edge .
I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street , And having lost her breath , she spoke , and panted , That she did make defect perfection , And , breathless , pour breathe forth .
Now Antony must leave her utterly .
Never . He will not . Age cannot wither her , nor custom stale Her infinite variety . Other women cloy The appetites they feed , but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies , for vilest things Become themselves in her , that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish .
All the contagion of the south light on you , You shames of Rome you herd of Boils and plagues Plaster you o’er , that you may be abhorr’d Further than seen and one infect another Against the wind a mile You souls of geese , That bear the shapes of men , how have you run From slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell All hurt behind backs red , and faces pale With flight and agued fear Mend and charge home , Or , by the fires of heaven , I’ll leave the foe And make my wars on you look to’t come on If you’ll stand fast , we’ll beat them to their wives , As they us to our trenches followed .
If beauty , wisdom , modesty , can settle The heart of Antony , Octavia is A blessèd lottery to him .
Let us go . Good Enobarbus , make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here .
Humbly , sir , I thank you .
No , nor I neither . I’ll be at your elbow .
An I but fist him once , an he come but within my view
But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover .
Thus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore , to the world’s end , will have bald followers .
I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion But soft , who wafts us yonder
I am undone by his going . I warrant you , he’s an infinitive thing upon my score . Good Master Fang , hold him sure . Good Master Snare , let him not ’scape . He comes continuantly to Pie Corner , saving your manhoods , to buy a saddle , and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber’s Head in Lumbert Street , to Master Smooth’s the silkman . I pray you , since my exion is entered , and my case so openly known to the world , let him be brought in to his answer . A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear , and I have borne , and borne , and borne , and have been fubbed off , and fubbed off , and fubbed off from this day to that day , that it is a shame to be thought on . There is no honesty in such dealing , unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast to bear every knave’s wrong . Yonder he comes , and that errant malmsey nose knave , Bardolph , with him . Do your offices , do your offices , Master Fang and Master Snare , do me , do me , do me your offices .
How now Whose mare’s dead What’s the matter
Sir John , I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly .
Ay , ay , Antipholus , look strange and frown . Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects . I am not Adriana , nor thy wife . The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear , That never object pleasing in thine eye , That never touch well welcome to thy hand , That never meat sweet savored in thy taste , Unless I spake , or looked , or touched , or carved to thee . How comes it now , my husband , O , how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself Thyself I call it , being strange to me , That , undividable , incorporate , Am better than thy dear self’s better part . Ah , do not tear away thyself from me For know , my love , as easy mayest thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf , And take unmingled thence that drop again Without addition or diminishing , As take from me thyself and not me too . How dearly would it touch thee to the quick , Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body , consecrate to thee ,
The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom .
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you .
Good night , sir .
Good night .
If it assume my noble father’s person , I’ll speak to it , though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace . I pray you all , If you have hitherto concealed this sight , Let it be tenable in your silence still . And whatsoever else shall hap tonight , Give it an understanding , but no tongue . I will requite your loves . So fare you well . Upon the platform , ’twixt eleven and twelve , I’ll visit you .
Our duty to your honor .
Now , sirrah , you do wish yourself in Egypt
Your loves , as mine to you . Farewell .
Would I had never come from thence , nor you thither .
If you can , your reason
My father’s spirit in arms . All is not well . I doubt some foul play . Would the night were come Till then sit still , my soul . Foul deeds will rise , Though all the earth o erwhelm them , to men’s eyes .
I see it in my motion , have it not in my tongue . But yet hie you to Egypt again .
And we will mend thy wages . I like this place , And willingly could waste my time in it .
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , Caesar’s or mine
Assuredly the thing is to be sold . Go with me . If you like upon report The soil , the profit , and this kind of life , I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly .
Caesar’s . Therefore , O Antony , stay not by his side . Thy dæmon that thy spirit which keeps thee is Noble , courageous , high , unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not . But near him thy angel Becomes afeard , as being o’erpowered . Therefore Make space enough between you .
I have , and I will hold , the quondam Quickly For the only she , And pauca there’s enough . Go to .
Good cousin , give me audience for a while .
I cry you mercy .
Mine host Pistol , you must come to my master and your hostess . He is very sick and would to bed . Good Bardolph , put thy face between his sheets , and do the office of a warming pan . Faith , he’s very ill .
Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners
Away , you rogue
I’ll keep them all . By God , he shall not have a Scot of them . No , if a Scot would save his soul , he shall not . I’ll keep them , by this hand
By my troth , he’ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days . The king has killed his heart . Good husband , come home presently .
You start away And lend no ear unto my purposes Those prisoners you shall keep
Come , shall I make you two friends We must to France together . Why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another’s throats
Nay , I will . That’s flat He said he would not ransom Mortimer , Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer . But I will find him when he lies asleep , And in his ear I’ll hollo Mortimer . Nay , I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but Mortimer , and give it him To keep his anger still in motion .
Let floods o erswell and fiends for food howl on
Hear you , cousin , a word .
You’ll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting
Base is the slave that pays .
That now I will have that’s the humor of it .
As manhood shall compound . Push home .
By ruffian lust should be contaminate Wouldst thou not spit at me , and spurn at me , And hurl the name of husband in my face , And tear the stained skin off my harlot brow , And from my false hand cut the wedding ring , And break it with a deep divorcing vow I know thou canst , and therefore see thou do it . I am possessed with an adulterate blot My blood is mingled with the crime of lust For if we too be one , and thou play false , I do digest the poison of thy flesh , Being strumpeted by thy contagion . Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed , I live disstained , thou undishonorèd .
Plead you to me , fair dame I know you not . In Ephesus I am but two hours old , As strange unto your town as to your talk , Who , every word by all my wit being scanned , Want wit in all one word to understand .
Fie , brother , how the world is changed with you When were you wont to use my sister thus She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner .
By Dromio
By me
By thee and this thou didst return from him That he did buffet thee and , in his blows , Denied my house for his , me for his wife .
Did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman What is the course and drift of your compact
Speak this no more .
To none but thee , no more but when to thee . If thou dost play with him at any game , Thou art sure to lose , and of that natural luck He beats thee ’gainst the odds . Thy luster thickens When he shines by . I say again , thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him , But , he away , ’tis noble .
Get thee gone . Say to Ventidius I would speak with him .
He shall to Parthia . Be it art or hap , He hath spoken true . The very dice obey him , And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance . If we draw lots , he speeds . His cocks do win the battle still of mine When it is all to naught , and his quails ever Beat mine , inhooped , at odds . I will to Egypt . And though I make this marriage for my peace , I’ th’ East my pleasure lies .
O come , Ventidius . You must to Parthia . Your commission’s ready . Follow me and receive ’t .
So , now the gates are ope now prove good seconds ’Tis for the followers fortune widens them , Not for the fliers mark me , and do the like .
Fool hardiness not I .
Nor I .
See , they have shut him in .
To the pot , I warrant him .
What is become of Martius
Slain , sir , doubtless .
Following the fliers at the very heels , With them he enters who , upon the sudden , Clapp’d to their gates he is himself alone , To answer all the city .
O noble fellow Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword , And , when it bows , stands up . Thou art left , Martius A carbuncle entire , as big as thou art , Were not so rich a jewel . Thou wast a soldier Even to Cato’s wish , not fierce and terrible Only in strokes but , with thy grim looks and The thunder like percussion of thy sounds , Thou madst thine enemies shake , as if the world Were feverous and did tremble .
By this sword , he that makes the first thrust , I’ll kill him . By this sword , I will .
Trouble yourselves no further . Pray you , hasten Your generals after .
Sword is an oath , and oaths must have their course .
Sir , Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia , and we’ll follow .
Corporal Nym , an thou wilt be friends , be friends an thou wilt not , why then be enemies with me too . Prithee , put up .
Till I shall see you in your soldiers’ dress , Which will become you both , farewell .
A noble shalt thou have , and present pay , And liquor likewise will I give to thee , And friendship shall combine , and brotherhood . I’ll live by Nym , and Nym shall live by me . Is not this just For I shall subtler be Unto the camp , and profits will accrue . Give me thy hand .
We shall , As I conceive the journey , be at the Mount Before you , Lepidus .
I shall have my noble
Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me And turn his merry note Unto the sweet bird’s throat , Come hither , come hither , come hither . Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather .
Your way is shorter . My purposes do draw me much about . You’ll win two days upon me .
In cash , most justly paid .
More , more , I prithee , more .
Sir , good success .
Well , then , that’s the humor of ’t .
It will make you melancholy , Monsieur Jaques .
Farewell .
As ever you come of women , come in quickly to Sir John . Ah , poor heart , he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold . Sweet men , come to him .
I thank it . More , I prithee , more . I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs . More , I prithee , more .
I , sir I never saw her till this time .
The king hath run bad humors on the knight , that’s the even of it .
My voice is ragged . I know I cannot please you .
Villain , thou liest for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
I do not desire you to please me . I do desire you to sing . Come , more , another stanzo . Call you em stanzos
I never spake with her in all my life .
What you will , Monsieur Jaques .
How can she thus then call us by our names Unless it be by inspiration
Nay , I care not for their names . They owe me nothing . Will you sing
How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave , Abetting him to thwart me in my mood . Be it my wrong you are from me exempt , But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt . Come , I will fasten on this sleeve of thine . Thou art an elm , my husband , I a vine , Whose weakness , married to thy stronger state , Makes me with thy strength to communicate . If aught possess thee from me , it is dross , Usurping ivy , brier , or idle moss , Who , all for want of pruning , with intrusion Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion .
To me she speaks she moves me for her theme . What , was I married to her in my dream Or sleep I now and think I hear all this What error drives our eyes and ears amiss Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offered fallacy .
Dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
O , for my beads I cross me for a sinner . This is the fairy land . O spite of spites
Give me some music . Music , moody food Of us that trade in love .
The music , ho
Let it alone . Let’s to billiards . Come , Charmian .
My arm is sore . Best play with Mardian .
As well a woman with an eunuch played As with a woman . Come , you’ll play with me , sir
As well as I can , madam .
And when good will is showed , though ’t come too short , The actor may plead pardon . I’ll none now . Give me mine angle . We’ll to th’ river . There , My music playing far off , I will betray Tawny finned fishes . My bended hook shall pierce Their slimy jaws , and as I draw them up I’ll think them every one an Antony And say , Aha You’re caught .
’Twas merry when You wagered on your angling , when your diver Did hang a salt fish on his hook , which he With fervency drew up .
That time Oh , times I laughed him out of patience , and that night I laughed him into patience . And next morn , Ere the ninth hour , I drunk him to his bed , Then put my tires and mantles on him , whilst I wore his sword Philippan .
My necessaries are embarked . Farewell . And , sister , as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant , do not sleep , But let me hear from you .
Do you doubt that
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor , Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood , A violet in the youth of primy nature , Forward , not permanent , sweet , not lasting , The perfume and suppliance of a minute . No more .
No more but so
Think it no more . For nature , crescent , does not grow alone In thews and bulk , but , as this temple waxes , The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal . Perhaps he loves you now , And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will , but you must fear . His greatness weighed , his will is not his own , For he himself is subject to his birth . He may not , as unvalued persons do , Carve for himself , for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state . And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head . Then if he says he loves you ,
Look , sir .
O , ’tis Martius Let’s fetch him off , or make remain alike .
All studies here I solemnly defy , Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke . And that same sword and buckler Prince of Wales But that I think his father loves him not And would be glad he met with some mischance I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale .
Farewell , kinsman . I’ll talk to you When you are better tempered to attend .
Why , what a wasp stung and impatient fool Art thou to break into this woman’s mood , Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
Why , look you , I am whipped and scourged with rods , Nettled and stung with pismires , when I hear Of this vile politician , Bolingbroke . In Richard’s time what do you call the place A plague upon it It is in Gloucestershire . Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept , His uncle York where I first bowed my knee Unto this king of smiles , this Bolingbroke . Sblood , when you and he came back from Ravenspurgh .
At Berkley Castle .
You say true . Why , what a candy deal of courtesy This fawning greyhound then did proffer me Look when his infant fortune came to age , And gentle Harry Percy , and kind cousin . O , the devil take such cozeners God forgive me Good uncle , tell your tale . I have done .
More at your request than to please myself .
Oh , from Italy Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , That long time have been barren .
Well then , if ever I thank any man , I’ll thank you . But that they call compliment is like th encounter of two dog apes . And when a man thanks me heartily , methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks . Come , sing . And you that will not , hold your tongues .
Well , I’ll end the song . Sirs , cover the while the duke will drink under this tree . He hath been all this day to look you .
Madam , madam
And I have been all this day to avoid him . He is too disputable for my company . I think of as many matters as he , but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them . Come , warble , come .
Antonio’s dead If thou say so , villain , Thou kill’st thy mistress . But well and free , If thou so yield him , there is gold , and here My bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings Have lipped , and trembled kissing .
First , madam , he is well .
Who doth ambition shun And loves to live i th sun , Seeking the food he eats And pleased with what he gets , Come hither , come hither , come hither . Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather .
Why , there’s more gold . But , sirrah , mark , we use To say the dead are well . Bring it to that , The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill uttering throat .
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention .
Good madam , hear me .
Well , go to , I will . But there’s no goodness in thy face if Antony Be free and healthful , so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings If not well , Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes , Not like a formal man .
Will ’t please you hear me
We talk with goblins , owls , and sprites If we obey them not , this will ensue They’ll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not Dromio thou , Dromio thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .
I am transformèd , master , am I not
I think thou art in mind , and so am I .
Nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
Thou hast thine own form .
No , I am an ape .
If thou art changed to aught , ’tis to an ass .
Tis true . She rides me , and I long for grass . Tis so . I am an ass else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me .
Come , come , no longer will I be a fool , To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn . Come , sir , to dinner . Dromio , keep the gate . Husband , I’ll dine above with you today , And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks . Sirrah , if any ask you for your master , Say he dines forth , and let no creature enter . Come , sister . Dromio , play the porter well .
Nym , thou hast spoke the right . His heart is fracted and corroborate .
Am I in earth , in heaven , or in hell Sleeping or waking , mad or well advised
The king is a good king , but it must be as it may . He passes some humors and careers .
Let us condole the knight , for , lambkins , we will live .
Away , varlets Draw , Bardolph . Cut me off the villain’s head . Throw the quean in the channel .
Throw me in the channel I’ll throw thee in the channel . Wilt thou , wilt thou , thou bastardly rogue Murder , murder Ah , thou honeysuckle villain , wilt thou kill God’s officers and the King’s Ah , thou honeyseed rogue , thou art a honeyseed , a man queller , and a woman queller .
Keep them off , Bardolph .
A rescue , a rescue
Good people , bring a rescue or two . Thou wot , wot thou Thou wot , wot ta Do , do , thou rogue . Do , thou hempseed .
Away , you scullion , you rampallion , you fustilarian I’ll tickle your catastrophe .
What is the matter Keep the peace here , ho
Good my lord , be good to me . I beseech you stand to me .
How now , Sir John What , are you brawling here Doth this become your place , your time , and business You should have been well on your way to York . Stand from him , fellow wherefore hang’st thou upon him
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st . Yet if thou say Antony lives , is well , Or friends with Caesar , or not captive to him , I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee .
Madam , he’s well .
Well said .
And friends with Caesar .
Th’ art an honest man .
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever .
Make thee a fortune from me .
But yet , madam
I do not like But yet . It does allay The good precedence . Fie upon But yet . But yet is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor . Prithee , friend , Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , The good and bad together . He’s friends with Caesar , In state of health , thou say’st , and , thou say’st , free .
Free , madam , no . I made no such report . He’s bound unto Octavia .
For what good turn
For the best turn i’ th’ bed .
Known unto these , and to myself disguised I’ll say as they say , and persever so , And in this mist at all adventures go .
Master , shall I be porter at the gate
And I’ll sing it . Thus it goes If it do come to pass That any man turn ass , Leaving his wealth and ease A stubborn will to please , Ducdame , ducdame , ducdame . Here shall he see Gross fools as he , An if he will come to me .
Ay and let none enter , lest I break your pate .
What’s that ducdame
Come , come , Antipholus , we dine too late .
Tis a Greek invocation , to call fools into a circle . I’ll go sleep if I can . If I cannot , I’ll rail against all the first born of Egypt .
And I’ll go seek the duke . His banquet is prepared .
I am pale , Charmian .
Madam , he’s married to Octavia .
The most infectious pestilence upon thee
Good madam , patience .
What say you
Hence , horrible villain , or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me I’ll unhair thy head
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , Smarting in ling’ring pickle
Gracious madam , I that do bring the news made not the match .
Fore God , his grace is bold to trust these traitors .
They shall be apprehended by and by .
Say ’tis not so , a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud . The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage , And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg .
How smooth and even they do bear themselves , As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crownèd with faith and constant loyalty .
He’s married , madam .
The king hath note of all that they intend , By interception which they dream not of .
Rogue , thou hast lived too long .
Nay , but the man that was his bedfellow , Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors That he should , for a foreign purse , so sell His sovereign’s life to death and treachery
Nay then , I’ll run . What mean you , madam I have made no fault .
Now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard . My Lord of Cambridge , and my kind Lord of Masham , And you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts . Think you not that the powers we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France , Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them
No doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
This will I carry to Rome .
And I this .
A murrain on’t I took this for silver .
See here these movers that do prize their hours At a crack’d drachm Cushions , leaden spoons , Irons of a doit , doublets that hangmen would Bury with those that wore them , these base slaves , Ere yet the fight be done , pack up down with them And hark , what noise the general makes To him There is the man of my soul’s hate , Aufidius , Piercing our Romans then , valiant Titus , take Convenient numbers to make good the city Whilst I , with those that have the spirit , will haste To help Cominius .
Worthy sir , thou bleed’st Thy exercise hath been too violent for A second course of fight .
Sir , praise me not My work hath yet not warm’d me fare you well The blood I drop is rather physical Than dangerous to me to Aufidius thus I will appear , and fight .
Good madam , keep yourself within yourself . The man is innocent .
Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt . Melt Egypt into Nile , and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents . Call the slave again . Though I am mad , I will not bite him . Call
He is afeard to come .
I will not hurt him . These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself , since I myself Have given myself the cause .
Come hither , sir . Though it be honest , it is never good To bring bad news . Give to a gracious message An host of tongues , but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt .
I have done my duty .
Is he married I cannot hate thee worser than I do If thou again say yes .
He’s married , madam .
Good Signior Angelo , you must excuse us all My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours . Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet , And that tomorrow you will bring it home . But here’s a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart , and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold , And that I did deny my wife and house . Thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this
Say what you will , sir , but I know what I know . That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink , Your own handwriting would tell you what I think .
I think thou art an ass .
Marry , so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear . I should kick being kicked and , being at that pass , You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass .
You’re sad , Signior Balthasar . Pray God our cheer May answer my good will and your good welcome here .
The gods confound thee Dost thou hold there still
Should I lie , madam
Oh , I would thou didst , So half my Egypt were submerged and made A cistern for scaled snakes Go , get thee hence . Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face , to me Thou wouldst appear most ugly . He is married
I crave your highness’ pardon .
Dear master , I can go no further . Oh , I die for food . Here lie I down and measure out my grave . Farewell , kind master .
Why , how now , Adam No greater heart in thee Live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little . If this uncouth forest yield anything savage , I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee . Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers . For my sake , be comfortable . Hold death awhile at the arm’s end . I will here be with thee presently , and if I bring thee not something to eat , I will give thee leave to die . But if thou diest before I come , thou art a mocker of my labor . Well said . Thou look’st cheerly , and I’ll be with thee quickly . Yet thou liest in the bleak air . Come , I will bear thee to some shelter , and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert . Cheerly , good Adam .
He is married
I doubt not that , since we are well persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours , Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us .
Never was monarch better feared and loved Than is your Majesty . There’s not , I think , a subject That sits in heart grief and uneasiness Under the sweet shade of your government .
Take no offense that I would not offend you . To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal . He’s married to Octavia .
Oh , that his fault should make a knave of thee , That art not what th’ art sure of Get thee hence . The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me . Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by ’em
Good your highness , patience .
In praising Antony , I have dispraised Caesar .
Many times , madam .
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed , which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal . Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs , Or lose your heart , or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity . Fear it , Ophelia . Fear it , my dear sister , And keep you in the rear of your affection , Out of the shot and danger of desire . The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon . Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes . The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosed . And in the morn and liquid dew of youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent . Be wary , then . Best safety lies in fear . Youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
I am paid for ’t now . Lead me from hence . I faint . O Iras , Charmian ’Tis no matter . Go to the fellow , good Alexas . Bid him Report the feature of Octavia her years , Her inclination . Let him not leave out The color of her hair . Bring me word quickly .
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart . But , good my brother , Do not , as some ungracious pastors do , Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whiles , like a puffed and reckless libertine , Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede .
O , fear me not .
I stay too long . But here my father comes . A double blessing is a double grace . Occasion smiles upon a second leave .
True . Those that were your father’s enemies Have steeped their galls in honey , and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zeal .
Now the fair goddess , Fortune , Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms Misguide thy opposers’ swords Bold gentleman , Prosperity be thy page
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness .
So service shall with steelèd sinews toil , And labor shall refresh itself with hope To do your Grace incessant services .
We judge no less . Uncle of Exeter , Enlarge the man committed yesterday That railed against our person . We consider It was excess of wine that set him on , And on his more advice we pardon him .
That’s mercy , but too much security . Let him be punished , sovereign , lest example Breed , by his sufferance , more of such a kind .
Oh , let us yet be merciful .
I think he be transformed into a beast , For I can nowhere find him like a man .
My lord , he is but even now gone hence . Here was he merry , hearing of a song .
If he , compact of jars , grow musical , We shall have shortly discord in the spheres . Go seek him . Tell him I would speak with him .
He saves my labor by his own approach .
Thy friend no less Than those she placeth highest So , farewell .
Why , how now , monsieur What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company What , you look merrily .
I hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
A fool , a fool , I met a fool i th forest , A motley fool . A miserable world As I do live by food , I met a fool , Who laid him down and basked him in the sun And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms , In good set terms , and yet a motley fool . Good morrow , fool , quoth I . No , sir , quoth he , Call me not ‘fool’ till heaven hath sent me fortune .
O Signior Balthasar , either at flesh or fish A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish .
Good meat , sir , is common that every churl affords .
And welcome more common , for that’s nothing but words .
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
Ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest . But though my cates be mean , take them in good part . Better cheer may you have , but not with better heart . But soft My door is lock’d . Go , bid them let us in .
Nay , if you have not , to it again . We will stay your leisure .
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn
I have done , i faith .
Mome , malt horse , capon , coxcomb , idiot , patch Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch . Dost thou conjure for wenches , that thou call’st for such store When one is one too many Go , get thee from the door .
What patch is made our porter My master stays in the street .
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners Deliver them up without their ransom straight , And make the Douglas son your only mean For powers in Scotland , which , for divers reasons Which I shall send you written , be assured Will easily be granted . You , my lord , Your son in Scotland being thus employed , Shall secretly into the bosom creep Of that same noble prelate , well beloved , The Archbishop .
Let him walk from whence he came , lest he catch cold on ’s feet .
Of York , is it not
Who talks within there Ho , open the door .
True who bears hard His brother’s death at Bristol , the Lord Scroop . I speak not this in estimation , As what I think might be , but what I know Is ruminated , plotted , and set down , And only stays but to behold the face Of that occasion that shall bring it on .
I smell it . Upon my life , it will do well .
Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip .
Let him forever go Let him not , Charmian . Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon , The other way’s a Mars . Bid you Alexas Bring me word how tall she is . Pity me , Charmian , But do not speak to me . Lead me to my chamber .
Why , it cannot choose but be a noble plot . And then the power of Scotland and of York To join with Mortimer , ha
Your hostages I have , so have you mine , And we shall talk before we fight .
Most meet That first we come to words , and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent , Which , if thou hast considered , let us know If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here .
To you all three , The senators alone of this great world , Chief factors for the gods I do not know Wherefore my father should revengers want , Having a son and friends , since Julius Caesar , Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted , There saw you laboring for him . What was ’t That moved pale Cassius to conspire And what Made the all honored , honest Roman Brutus , With the armed rest , courtiers of beauteous freedom , To drench the Capitol , but that they would Have one man but a man And that is it Hath made me rig my navy , at whose burden The angered ocean foams , with which I meant To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on my noble father .
Thou worthiest Martius
Go , sound thy trumpet in the market place Call thither all the officers o’ the town , Where they shall know our mind away
Take your time .
Right , sir , I’ll tell you when an you tell me wherefore .
Thou canst not fear us , Pompey , with thy sails . We’ll speak with thee at sea . At land , thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee .
Wherefore For my dinner . I have not dined today .
At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house , But since the cuckoo builds not for himself , Remain in ’t as thou mayst .
Nor today here you must not . Come again when you may .
Be pleased to tell us For this is from the present how you take The offers we have sent you .
There’s the point .
O my most worshipful lord , an ’t please your Grace , I am a poor widow of Eastcheap , and he is arrested at my suit .
Which do not be entreated to , but weigh What it is worth embraced .
For what sum
And what may follow , To try a larger fortune .
It is more than for some , my lord it is for all I have . He hath eaten me out of house and home . He hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his . But I will have some of it out again , or I will ride thee o nights like the mare .
You have made me offer Of Sicily , Sardinia . And I must Rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send Measures of wheat to Rome . This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted .
I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up .
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe
That’s our offer .
How comes this , Sir John Fie , what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own
The porter for this time , sir , and my name is Dromio .
What is the gross sum that I owe thee
O villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name The one ne er got me credit , the other mickle blame . If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place , Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name , or thy name for an ass .
Marry , if thou wert an honest man , thyself and the money too . Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel gilt goblet , sitting in my Dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea coal fire , upon Wednesday in Wheeson week , when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing man of Windsor , thou didst swear to me then , as I was washing thy wound , to marry me and make me my lady thy wife . Canst thou deny it Did not goodwife Keech , the butcher’s wife , come in then and call me Gossip Quickly , coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar telling us she had a good dish of prawns , whereby thou didst desire to eat some , whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound And didst thou not , when she was gone downstairs , desire me to be no more so familiarity with
What a coil is there , Dromio Who are those at the gate
Let my master in , Luce .
Faith , no , he comes too late , And so tell your master .
O Lord , I must laugh . Have at you with a proverb shall I set in my staff
Have at you with another that’s When , can you tell
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer , but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience . Though I lose The praise of it by telling , you must know , When Caesar and your brother were at blows , Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly .
I have heard it , Pompey , And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you .
Let me have your hand .
I did not think , sir , to have met you here .
Yet here , Laertes Aboard , aboard , for shame The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for . There , my blessing with thee . And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character . Give thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any unproportioned thought his act . Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar . Those friends thou hast , and their adoption tried , Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel , But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new hatched , unfledged comrade . Beware Of entrance to a quarrel , but being in , Bear ’t that th opposèd may beware of thee . Give every man thy ear but few thy voice . Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment . Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy , But not expressed in fancy rich , not gaudy , For the apparel oft proclaims the man , And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that . Neither a borrower nor a lender be , For loan oft loses both itself and friend , And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry . This above all to thine own self be true , And it must follow , as the night the day , Thou canst not then be false to any man . Farewell . My blessing season this in thee .
Most humbly do I take my leave , my lord .
The time invites you . Go . Your servants tend .
Farewell , Ophelia , and remember well What I have said to you .
The beds i’ th’ East are soft , and thanks to you , That called me timelier than my purpose hither , For I have gained by ’t .
Since I saw you last There’s a change upon you .
Well , I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face , But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal .
And so they shall .
In faith , it is exceedingly well aimed .
And ’tis no little reason bids us speed To save our heads by raising of a head , For , bear ourselves as even as we can , The King will always think him in our debt , And think we think ourselves unsatisfied , Till he hath found a time to pay us home . And see already how he doth begin To make us strangers to his looks of love .
He does , he does . We’ll be revenged on him .
Cousin , farewell . No further go in this Than I by letters shall direct your course . When time is ripe , which will be suddenly , I’ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer , Where you and Douglas and our powers at once , As I will fashion it , shall happily meet To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms , Which now we hold at much uncertainty .
Farewell , good brother . We shall thrive , I trust .
If thy name be called Luce , Luce , thou hast answered him well .
Uncle , adieu O , let the hours be short Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport .
Do you hear , you minion You’ll let us in , I hope
Well met here .
I thought to have asked you .
I hope so , Lepidus . Thus we are agreed . I crave our composition may be written And sealed between us .
And you said no .
That’s the next to do .
So , come , help . Well struck There was blow for blow .
Thou baggage , let me in .
We’ll feast each other ere we part , and let’s Draw lots who shall begin .
Can you tell for whose sake
That will I , Pompey .
Master , knock the door hard .
No , Antony , take the lot . But , first or last , Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame . I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there .
Let him knock till it ache .
You have heard much .
You’ll cry for this , minion , if I beat the door down .
I have fair meanings , sir .
What needs all that , and a pair of stocks in the town
And fair words to them .
Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise
Then so much have I heard . And I have heard Apollodorus carried
By my troth , your town is troubled with unruly boys .
No more of that . He did so .
Tis in my memory locked , And you yourself shall keep the key of it .
Are you there , wife You might have come before .
Farewell .
What is ’t , Ophelia , he hath said to you
What , I pray you
So please you , something touching the Lord Hamlet .
Marry , well bethought . Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you , and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous . If it be so as so ’tis put on me And that in way of caution I must tell you , You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor . What is between you Give me up the truth .
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress .
I know thee now . How far’st thou , soldier
Well , And well am like to do , for I perceive , Four feasts are toward .
He hath , my lord , of late made many tenders Of his affection to me .
So may Your Highness , and yet punish , too .
Affection Pooh , you speak like a green girl , Unsifted in such perilous circumstance . Do you believe his tenders , as you call them
Sir , you show great mercy if you give him life After the taste of much correction .
I do not know , my lord , what I should think .
Alas , your too much love and care of me Are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch . If little faults proceeding on distemper Shall not be winked at , how shall we stretch our eye When capital crimes , chewed , swallowed , and digested , Appear before us We’ll yet enlarge that man , Though Cambridge , Scroop , and Grey , in their dear care And tender preservation of our person , Would have him punished . And now to our French causes . Who are the late commissioners
Marry , I’ll teach you . Think yourself a baby That you have ta en these tenders for true pay , Which are not sterling . Tender yourself more dearly , Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , Running it thus you’ll tender me a fool .
I one , my lord . Your Highness bade me ask for it today .
And then he drew a dial from his poke And , looking on it with lackluster eye , Says very wisely , It is ten o clock . Thus we may see , quoth he , how the world wags . Tis but an hour ago since it was nine , And after one hour more ’twill be eleven . And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe , And then from hour to hour we rot and rot , And thereby hangs a tale . When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time , My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deep contemplative , And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial . O noble fool A worthy fool Motley’s the only wear .
So did you me , my liege .
What fool is this
And I , my royal sovereign .
O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier And says , If ladies be but young and fair , They have the gift to know it . And in his brain , Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage , he hath strange places crammed With observation , the which he vents In mangled forms . Oh , that I were a fool I am ambitious for a motley coat .
Then , Richard , Earl of Cambridge , there is yours . There yours , Lord Scroop of Masham . And , sir knight , Grey of Northumberland , this same is yours . Read them , and know I know your worthiness . My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter , We will aboard tonight . Why , how now , gentlemen What see you in those papers , that you lose So much complexion Look you , how they change . Their cheeks are paper . Why , what read you there That have so cowarded and chased your blood Out of appearance
Thou shalt have one .
Heigh ho An it be not four by the day , I’ll be hanged . Charles’s Wain is over the new chimney , and yet our horse not packed . What , ostler
Anon , anon .
My lord , he hath importuned me with love In honorable fashion .
It is my only suit , Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise . I must have liberty Withal , as large a charter as the wind , To blow on whom I please , for so fools have . And they that are most gallèd with my folly , They most must laugh . And why , sir , must they so The why is plain as way to parish church He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly , although he smart , Not to seem senseless of the bob . If not , The wise man’s folly is anatomized Even by the squand ring glances of the fool . Invest me in my motley . Give me leave To speak my mind , and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th infected world , If they will patiently receive my medicine .
Ay , fashion you may call it . Go to , go to .
Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do .
And hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , With almost all the holy vows of heaven .
What , for a counter , would I do but good
Ay , springes to catch woodcocks . I do know , When the blood burns , how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows . These blazes , daughter , Giving more light than heat , extinct in both Even in their promise as it is a making , You must not take for fire . From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence . Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley . For Lord Hamlet , Believe so much in him that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you . In few , Ophelia , Do not believe his vows , for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show , But mere implorators of unholy suits , Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds , The better to beguile . This is for all I would not , in plain terms , from this time forth , Have you so slander any moment leisure , As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet . Look to ’t , I charge you . Come your ways .
I prithee , Tom , beat Cut’s saddle . Put a few flocks in the point . Poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess .
I shall obey , my lord .
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin , For thou thyself hast been a libertine , As sensual as the brutish sting itself , And all th embossèd sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog , and that is the next way to give poor jades the bots . This house is turned upside down since Robin ostler died .
Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose . It was the death of him .
such poor people , saying that ere long they should call me madam And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings I put thee now to thy book oath . Deny it if thou canst .
My lord , this is a poor mad soul , and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you . She hath been in good case , and the truth is , poverty hath distracted her . But , for these foolish officers , I beseech you I may have redress against them .
Sir John , Sir John , I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way . It is not a confident brow , nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you , can thrust me from a level consideration . You have , as it appears to me , practiced upon the easy yielding spirit of this woman , and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person .
Yea , in truth , my lord .
Pray thee , peace . Pay her the debt you owe her , and unpay the villany you have done her . The one you may do with sterling money , and the other with current repentance .
My lord , I will not undergo this sneap without reply . You call honorable boldness impudent sauciness . If a man will make curtsy and say nothing , he is virtuous . No , my lord , my humble duty remembered , I will not be your suitor . I say to you , I do desire deliverance from these officers , being upon hasty employment in the King’s affairs .
Your wife , sir knave Go , get you from the door .
If you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .
Here is neither cheer , sir , nor welcome . We would fain have either .
In debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
They stand at the door , master . Bid them welcome hither .
There is something in the wind , that we cannot get in .
You would say so , master , if your garments were thin . Your cake there is warm within you stand here in the cold . It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
Go , fetch me something I’ll break ope the gate .
Break any breaking here , and I’ll break your knave’s pate .
A man may break a word with you , sir , and words are but wind , Ay , and break it in your face , so he break it not behind .
It seems thou want’st breaking . Out upon thee , hind
Let me shake thy hand . I never hated thee . I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior .
Sir , I never loved you much , but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did .
Enjoy thy plainness . It nothing ill becomes thee . Aboard my galley I invite you all . Will you lead , lords
Show ’s the way , sir .
Come .
You and I have known , sir .
At sea , I think .
We have , sir .
You have done well by water .
And you by land .
Breathe you , my friends well fought we are come off Like Romans , neither foolish in our stands , Nor cowardly in retire believe me , sirs , We shall be charged again . Whiles we have struck , By interims and conveying gusts we have heard The charges of our friends . Ye Roman gods Lead their successes as we wish our own , That both our powers , with smiling fronts encountering , May give you thankful sacrifice .
Why , who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea Till that the weary very means do ebb
I will praise any man that will praise me , though it cannot be denied what I have done by land .
I think this be the most villanous house in all London road for fleas . I am stung like a tench .
Thy news
The air bites shrewdly . It is very cold .
Nor what I have done by water .
Like a tench By the Mass , there is ne er a king christen could be better bit than I have been since the first cock .
The citizens of Corioli have issued , And given to Lartius and to Martius battle I saw our party to their trenches driven , And then I came away .
Though thou speak’st truth , Methinks thou speak’st not well . How long is’t since
Above an hour , my lord .
What woman in the city do I name , When that I say the city woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders Who can come in and say that I mean her , When such a one as she such is her neighbor Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not of my cost , Thinking that I mean him , but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech There then . How then , what then Let me see wherein My tongue hath wronged him . If it do him right , Then he hath wronged himself . If he be free , Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies Unclaimed of any man . But who comes here
Forbear , and eat no more .
Why , I have eat none yet .
Nor shalt not till necessity be served .
I do confess my fault , And do submit me to Your Highness mercy .
To which we all appeal .
Of what kind should this cock come of
Art thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners , That in civility thou seem’st so empty
You touched my vein at first . The thorny point Of bare distress hath ta en from me the show Of smooth civility , yet am I inland bred And know some nurture . But forbear , I say . He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answerèd .
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed . You must not dare , for shame , to talk of mercy , For your own reasons turn into your bosoms , As dogs upon their masters , worrying you . See you , my princes and my noble peers , These English monsters . My Lord of Cambridge here , You know how apt our love was to accord To furnish him with all appurtenants Belonging to his honor , and this man Hath , for a few light crowns , lightly conspired , And sworn unto the practices of France , To kill us here in Hampton to the which This knight , no less for bounty bound to us Than Cambridge is , hath likewise sworn . But Oh , What shall I say to thee , Lord Scroop , thou cruel , Ingrateful , savage , and inhuman creature Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels , That knew’st the very bottom of my soul , That almost mightst have coined me into gold , Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use May it be possible that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger Tis so strange That , though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white , my eye will scarcely see it . Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke devils sworn to either’s purpose , Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them .
It is a nipping and an eager air .
What hour now
I think it lacks of twelve .
No , it is struck .
Indeed I heard it not . It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk .
What does this mean , my lord
The king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse , Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels , And , as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down , The kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge .
Is it a custom
Ay , marry , is ’t . But to my mind , though I am native here And to the manner born , it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance . This heavy headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations .
Here’s too much out upon thee I pray thee , let me in .
Ay , when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin .
Well , I’ll break in . Go , borrow me a crow .
A crow without feather Master , mean you so For a fish without a fin , there’s a fowl without a feather . If a crow help us in , sirrah , we’ll pluck a crow together .
An you will not be answered with reason , I must die .
Go , get thee gone . Fetch me an iron crow .
What would you have Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness .
I almost die for food , and let me have it .
Have patience , sir . O , let it not be so . Herein you war against your reputation , And draw within the compass of suspect Th unviolated honor of your wife . Once this your long experience of her wisdom , Her sober virtue , years , and modesty Plead on her part some cause to you unknown . And doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you . Be ruled by me depart in patience , And let us to the Tiger all to dinner , And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint . If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day , A vulgar comment will be made of it And that supposèd by the common rout Against your yet ungallèd estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead For slander lives upon succession , Forever housèd where it gets possession .
Sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
Speak you so gently Pardon me , I pray you . I thought that all things had been savage here , And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment . But whate er you are That in this desert inaccessible , Under the shade of melancholy boughs , Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time , If ever you have looked on better days , If ever been where bells have knolled to church , If ever sat at any good man’s feast , If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied , Let gentleness my strong enforcement be , In the which hope I blush and hide my sword .
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church , And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered . And therefore sit you down in gentleness , And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be ministered .
Why , they will allo w us ne er a jordan , and then we leak in your chimney , and your chamber lye breeds fleas like a loach .
What , ostler , come away and be hanged . Come away .
I have a gammon of bacon and two races of ginger to be delivered as far as Charing Cross .
You speak as having power to do wrong but answer in th effect of your reputation , and satisfy this poor woman .
God’s body , the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved . What , ostler A plague on thee Hast thou never an eye in thy head Canst not hear An ’twere not as good deed as drink to break the pate on thee , I am a very villain . Come , and be hanged . Hast no faith in thee
Come hither , hostess .
Good morrow , carriers . What’s o clock
I think it be two o clock .
Now , Master Gower , what news
I prithee , lend me thy lantern to see my gelding in the stable .
The King , my lord , and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand . The rest the paper tells .
Nay , by God , soft . I know a trick worth two of that , i faith .
I pray thee , lend me thine .
Ay , when , canst tell Lend me thy lantern , quoth he . Marry , I’ll see thee hanged first .
Sirrah carrier , what time do you mean to come to London
Yes , something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea .
And you by land .
There I deny my land service . But give me your hand , Menas .
If our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
All men’s faces are true , whatsome’er their hands are .
But there is never a fair woman has a true face .
No slander . They steal hearts .
But thou , gainst all proportion , didst bring in Wonder to wait on treason and on murder , And whatsoever cunning fiend it was That wrought upon thee so preposterously Hath got the voice in hell for excellence . All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches , colors , and with forms being fetched From glist ring semblances of piety . But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up , Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason , Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor . If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world , He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman’s . Oh , how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful Why , so didst thou . Seem they grave and learnèd Why , so didst thou . Come they of noble family Why , so didst thou . Seem they religious Why , so didst thou . Or are they spare in diet , Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger , Constant in spirit , not swerving with the blood , Garnished and decked in modest complement , Not working with the eye without the ear , And but in purgèd judgment trusting neither Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem . And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full fraught man and best endued With some suspicion . I will weep for thee , For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man . Their faults are open . Arrest them to the answer of the law , And God acquit them of their practices .
We came hither to fight with you .
For my part , I am sorry it is turned to a drinking . Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
If he do , sure he cannot weep ’t back again .
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles , like a doe , I go to find my fawn And give it food . There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love . Till he be first sufficed , Oppressed with two weak evils , age and hunger , I will not touch a bit .
Go find him out , And we will nothing waste till you return .
I thank you and be blessed for your good comfort .
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy . This wide and universal theater Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in .
All the world’s a stage , And all the men and women merely players . They have their exits and their entrances , And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages . At first the infant , Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms . Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face , creeping like snail Unwillingly to school . And then the lover , Sighing like furnace , with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress eyebrow . Then a soldier , Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard , Jealous in honor , sudden and quick in quarrel ,
As I am a gentleman
Faith , you said so before .
As I am a gentleman . Come . No more words of it .
You have prevailed . I will depart in quiet And , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry . I know a wench of excellent discourse , Pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle . There will we dine . This woman that I mean , My wife but , I protest , without desert Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal To her will we to dinner . Get you home And fetch the chain by this I know ’tis made . Bring it , I pray you , to the Porpentine , For there’s the house . That chain will I bestow Be it for nothing but to spite my wife Upon mine hostess there . Good sir , make haste . Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me , I’ll knock elsewhere , to see if they’ll disdain me .
By this heavenly ground I tread on , I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining chambers .
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence .
Glasses , glasses , is the only drinking . And for thy walls , a pretty slight drollery , or the story of the Prodigal or the German hunting in waterwork is worth a thousand of these bed hangers and these fly bitten tapestries . Let it be ten pound , if thou canst . Come , an ’twere not for thy humors , there’s not a better wench in England . Go wash thy face , and draw the action . Come , thou must not be in this humor with me . Dost not know me Come , come , I know thou wast set on to this .
Do so . This jest shall cost me some expense .
Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon’s mouth . And then the justice , In fair round belly with good capon lined , With eyes severe and beard of formal cut , Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part . The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon With spectacles on nose and pouch on side , His youthful hose , well saved , a world too wide For his shrunk shank , and his big manly voice , Turning again toward childish treble , pipes And whistles in his sound . Last scene of all , That ends this strange eventful history , Is second childishness and mere oblivion , Sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything .
Time enough to go to bed with a candle , I warrant thee . Come , neighbour Mugs , we’ll call up the gentlemen . They will along with company , for they have great charge .
Welcome . Set down your venerable burden , And let him feed .
What ho , chamberlain
I thank you most for him .
At hand , quoth pickpurse .
So had you need . I scarce can speak to thank you for myself .
That’s even as fair as at hand , quoth the Chamberlain , for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from laboring thou layest the plot how .
Welcome . Fall to . I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes . Give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
Good morrow , Master Gadshill . It holds current that I told you yesternight there’s a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold . I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper a kind of auditor , one that hath abundance of charge too , God knows what . They are up already and call for eggs and butter . They will away presently .
Sirrah , if they meet not with Saint Nicholas clerks , I’ll give thee this neck .
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition . And indeed it takes From our achievements , though performed at height , The pith and marrow of our attribute . So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them As in their birth Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault . The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal .
Look , my lord , it comes
Angels and ministers of grace defend us Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned , Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , Be thy intents wicked or charitable , Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee . I’ll call thee Hamlet , King , Father , royal Dane . O , answer me Let me not burst in ignorance , but tell Why thy canonized bones , hearsed in death , Have burst their cerements why the sepulcher ,
You’ve said , sir . We looked not for Mark Antony here . Pray you , is he married to Cleopatra
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Richard , Earl of Cambridge . I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Henry , Lord Scroop of Masham . I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia .
True , sir . She was the wife of Caius Marcellus .
Our purposes God justly hath discovered , And I repent my fault more than my death , Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive , Although my body pay the price of it .
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius .
For me , the gold of France did not seduce , Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended But God be thankèd for prevention , Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice , Beseeching God and you to pardon me .
Pray ye , sir
’Tis true .
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o er myself , Prevented from a damnèd enterprise . My fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together .
If I were bound to divine of this unity , I would not prophesy so .
God quit you in His mercy . Hear your sentence You have conspired against our royal person , Joined with an enemy proclaimed , and from his coffers Received the golden earnest of our death , Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter , His princes and his peers to servitude , His subjects to oppression and contempt , And his whole kingdom into desolation . Touching our person , seek we no revenge , But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender , Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws We do deliver you . Get you therefore hence , Poor miserable wretches , to your death , The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure , and true repentance Of all your dear offences . Bear them hence .
Blow , blow , thou winter wind . Thou art not so unkind As man’s ingratitude . Thy tooth is not so keen , Because thou art not seen , Although thy breath be rude . Heigh ho , sing heigh ho , unto the green holly . Most friendship is feigning , most loving mere folly . Then heigh ho , the holly . This life is most jolly . Freeze , freeze , thou bitter sky , That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot . Though thou the waters warp , Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remembered not . Heigh ho , sing heigh ho , unto the green holly . Most friendship is feigning , most loving mere folly . Then heigh ho , the holly . This life is most jolly .
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son , As you have whispered faithfully you were , And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face , Be truly welcome hither . I am the duke That loved your father . The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me . Good old man , Thou art right welcome as thy master is . Support him by the arm . Give me your hand , And let me all your fortunes understand .
’Tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour , And bring thy news so late
Spies of the Volsces Held me in chase , that I was forced to wheel Three or four miles about , else had I , sir , Half an hour since brought my report .
Who’s yonder , That does appear as he were flay’d O gods He has the stamp of Martius and I have Before time seen him thus .
Come I too late
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour More than I know the sound of Martius’ tongue From every meaner man .
Come I too late
Ay , if you come not in the blood of others , But mantled in your own .
O , let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo’d , in heart As merry as when our nuptial day was done , And tapers burn’d to bedward
No , I’ll none of it . I pray thee keep that for the hangman , for I know thou worshipest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may .
What talkest thou to me of the hangman If I hang , I’ll make a fat pair of gallows , for if I hang , old Sir John hangs with me , and thou knowest he is no starveling . Tut , there are other Troyans that thou dream’st not of , the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace , that would , if matters should be looked into , for their own credit sake make all whole . I am joined with no foot land rakers , no long staff sixpenny strikers , none of these mad mustachio purple hued malt worms , but with nobility and tranquillity , burgomasters and great oneyers , such as can hold in , such as will strike sooner than speak , and speak sooner than drink , and drink sooner than pray , and yet , zounds , I lie , for they pray continually to their saint the commonwealth , or rather not pray to her but prey on her , for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots .
What , the commonwealth their boots Will she hold out water in foul way
She will , she will . Justice hath liquored her . We steal as in a castle , cocksure . We have the receipt of fern seed we walk invisible .
Nay , by my faith , I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern seed for your walking invisible .
Give me thy hand . Thou shalt have a share in our purchase , as I am a true man .
And may it be that you have quite forgot A husband’s office Shall , Antipholus , Even in the spring of love thy love springs rot Shall love , in building , grow so ruinous If you did wed my sister for her wealth , Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness . Or if you like elsewhere , do it by stealth Muffle your false love with some show of blindness . Let not my sister read it in your eye Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator Look sweet , be fair , become disloyalty Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger . Bear a fair presence , though your heart be tainted . Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint . Be secret false . What need she be acquainted What simple thief brags of his own attaint Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board . Shame hath a bastard fame , well managèd Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word . Alas , poor women , make us but believe , Being compact of credit , that you love us . Though others have the arm , show us the sleeve We in your motion turn , and you may move us . Then , gentle brother , get you in again . Comfort my sister , cheer her , call her wife . Tis holy sport to be a little vain When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife .
Sweet mistress what your name is else I know not , Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine ,
I think so too . But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity . Octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
Who would not have his wife so
Not he that himself is not so , which is Mark Antony . He will to his Egyptian dish again . Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar , and , as I said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance . Antony will use his affection where it is . He married but his occasion here .
And thus it may be . Come , sir , will you aboard I have a health for you .
I shall take it , sir . We have used our throats in Egypt .
Come , let’s away .
Not see him since Sir , sir , that cannot be . But were I not the better part made mercy , I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge , thou present . But look to it Find out thy brother , wheresoe er he is . Seek him with candle . Bring him , dead or living , Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory . Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure , do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee .
Oh , that your Highness knew my heart in this I never loved my brother in my life .
More villain thou . Well , push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands . Do this expediently , and turn him going .
Here they’ll be , man . Some o’ their plants are ill rooted already . The least wind i’ th’ world will blow them down .
Lepidus is high colored .
They have made him drink alms drink .
As they pinch one another by the disposition , he cries out , No more , reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink .
But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion .
Why , this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship . I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave .
To be called into a huge sphere , and not to be seen to move in ’t , are the holes where eyes should be , which pitifully disaster the cheeks .
Thus do they , sir they take the flow o’ th’ Nile By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid . They know By th’ height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth Or foison follow . The higher Nilus swells The more it promises . As it ebbs , the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , And shortly comes to harvest .
Now , lords , for France , the enterprise whereof Shall be to you as us , like glorious . We doubt not of a fair and lucky war , Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings . We doubt not now But every rub is smoothèd on our way . Then forth , dear countrymen . Let us deliver Our puissance into the hand of God , Putting it straight in expedition . Cheerly to sea . The signs of war advance . No king of England if not king of France .
Nay , rather let me have it as you are a false thief .
Go to . Homo is a common name to all men . Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable . Farewell , you muddy knave .
Hang there , my verse , in witness of my love . And thou , thrice crownéd queen of night , survey With thy chaste eye , from thy pale sphere above , Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway . O Rosalind , these trees shall be my books , And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character , That every eye which in this forest looks Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere . Run , run , Orlando , carve on every tree The fair , the chaste , and unexpressive she .
Pray thee , Sir John , let it be but twenty nobles . I faith , I am loath to pawn my plate , so God save me , la .
Let it alone . I’ll make other shift . You’ll be a fool still .
Well , you shall have it , though I pawn my gown . I hope you’ll come to supper . You’ll pay me all together
Will I live Go with her , with her . Hook on , hook on .
Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper
No more words . Let’s have her .
I have heard better news .
What’s the news , my good lord
Where lay the King last night
At Basingstoke , my lord .
I hope , my lord , all’s well . What is the news , my lord
Come all his forces back
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth’s wonder , more than earth divine . Teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak . Lay open to my earthy gross conceit , Smothered in errors , feeble , shallow , weak , The folded meaning of your words deceit . Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field Are you a god would you create me new Transform me , then , and to your power I’ll yield . But if that I am I , then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine , Nor to her bed no homage do I owe . Far more , far more , to you do I decline . O , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears . Sing , Siren , for thyself , and I will dote . Spread o er the silver waves thy golden hairs , And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie , And in that glorious supposition think He gains by death that hath such means to die . Let Love , being light , be drownèd if she sink .
What , are you mad that you do reason so
Not mad , but mated how , I do not know .
It is a fault that springeth from your eye .
For gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
And how like you this shepherd’s life , Master Touchstone
Truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life , it is naught . In respect that it is solitary , I like it very well but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life . Now in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious . As it is a spare life , look you , it fits my humor well but as there is no more plenty in it , it goes much against my stomach . Hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd
Flower of warriors , How is it with Titus Lartius
As with a man busied about decrees Condemning some to death , and some to exile Ransoming him , or pitying , threatening the other Holding Corioli in the name of Rome , Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash , To let him slip at will .
Where is that slave Which told me they had beat you to your trenches Where is he call him hither .
Let him alone He did inform the truth but for our gentlemen , The common file a plague tribunes for them The mouse ne’er shunn’d the cat as they did budge From rascals worse than they .
But how prevail’d you
Will the time serve to tell I do not think . Where is the enemy are you lords o’ the field If not , why cease you till you are so
Martius , We have at disadvantage fought and did Retire to win our purpose .
Wherein we saw thee quietly interred , Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again . What may this mean , That thou , dead corse , again in complete steel Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon , Making night hideous and we fools of nature , So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls Say why is this Wherefore What should we do
It beckons you to go away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone .
Look , with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground . But do not go with it .
No , by no means .
It will not speak . Then I will follow it .
Do not , my lord .
Why , what should be the fear I do not set my life in a pin’s fee , And for my soul what can it do to that , Being a thing immortal as itself It waves me forth again . I’ll follow it .
What if it tempt you toward the flood , my lord , Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o er his base into the sea ,
You’ve strange serpents there
Ay , Lepidus .
No more but that I know the more one sickens , the worse at ease he is , and that he that wants money , means , and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet , and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred .
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun . So is your crocodile .
Such a one is a natural philosopher . Wast ever in court , shepherd
They are so .
No , truly .
Sit , and some wine . A health to Lepidus
Then thou art damned .
Nay , I hope .
I am not so well as I should be , but I’ll ne’er out .
Truly , thou art damned , like an ill roasted egg , all on one side .
Not till you have slept . I fear me you’ll be in till then .
For not being at court Your reason .
Nay , certainly , I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things . Without contradiction I have heard that .
Why , if thou never wast at court , thou never saw’st good manners if thou never saw’st good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation . Thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
Pompey , a word .
Say in mine ear . What is ’t
Come , shelter , shelter I have removed Falstaff’s horse , and he frets like a gummed velvet .
Stand close .
Poins Poins , and be hanged Poins
Peace , you fat kidneyed rascal . What a brawling dost thou keep
Where’s Poins , Hal
He is walked up to the top of the hill . I’ll go seek him .
I am accursed to rob in that thief’s company . The rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I know not where . If I travel but four foot by the square further afoot , I shall break my wind . Well , I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this , if I ’scape hanging for killing that rogue . I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two and twenty years , and yet I am bewitched with the rogue’s company . If the rascal hath not given me medicines to make me love him , I’ll be hanged . It could not be else I have drunk medicines . Poins Hal A plague upon you both . Bardolph Peto I’ll starve ere I’ll rob a foot further . An ’twere not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and to leave these rogues , I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth . Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me , and the stony hearted villains know it well enough . A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another
Gaze where you should , and that will clear your sight .
As good to wink , sweet love , as look on night .
Why call you me love Call my sister so .
Thy sister’s sister .
That’s my sister .
No , It is thyself , mine own self’s better part , Mine eye’s clear eye , my dear heart’s dearer heart , My food , my fortune , and my sweet hope’s aim , My sole earth’s heaven , and my heaven’s claim .
All this my sister is , or else should be .
Call thyself sister , sweet , for I am thee . Thee will I love and with thee lead my life Thou hast no husband yet , nor I no wife . Give me thy hand .
O soft , sir Hold you still . I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
Why , how now , Dromio . Where runn’st thou so fast
Do you know me , sir Am I Dromio Am I your man Am I myself
And there assume some other horrible form , Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness Think of it . The very place puts toys of desperation , Without more motive , into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath .
It waves me still . Go on . I’ll follow thee .
You shall not go , my lord .
Hold off your hands .
Be ruled . You shall not go .
My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve . Still am I called . Unhand me , gentlemen . By heaven , I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me . I say , away Go on . I’ll follow thee .
Not a whit , Touchstone . Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court . You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands . That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
Instance , briefly . Come , instance .
He waxes desperate with imagination .
Why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
Let’s follow . Tis not fit thus to obey him .
Why , do not your courtier’s hands sweat And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow , shallow . A better instance , I say . Come .
Have after . To what issue will this come
Besides , our hands are hard .
Your lips will feel them the sooner . Shallow again . A more sounder instance . Come .
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet .
Most shallow man . Thou worms meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed . Learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat . Mend the instance , shepherd .
You have too courtly a wit for me . I’ll rest .
Forsake thy seat , I do beseech thee , captain , And hear me speak a word .
Forbear me till anon . This wine for Lepidus
What manner o’ thing is your crocodile
It is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth . It is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs . It lives by that which nourisheth it , and , the elements once out of it , it transmigrates .
What color is it of
Of it own color too .
Prithee , honey sweet husband , let me bring thee to Staines .
No for my manly heart doth earn . Bardolph , be blithe . Nym , rouse thy vaunting veins . Boy , bristle thy courage up . For Falstaff , he is dead , and we must earn therefore .
Would I were with him , wheresome er he is , either in heaven or in hell .
Nay , sure , he’s not in hell He’s in Arthur’s bosom , if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom . He made a finer end , and went away an it had been any christom child . He parted ev n just between twelve and one , ev n at the turning o th tide for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his finger’s end , I knew there was but one way , for his nose was as sharp as a pen , and he told of green fields . How now , Sir John quoth I . What , man , be o good cheer So he cried out God , God , God three or four times . Now I , to comfort him , bid him he should not think of God . I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet . So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet . I put my hand into the bed and felt them , and they were as cold as any stone . Then I felt to his knees , and so upward and upward , and all was as cold as any stone .
They say he cried out of sack .
Ay , that he did .
Whew
A plague upon you all Give me my horse , you rogues . Give me my horse and be hanged
Peace , you fat guts Lie down , lay thine ear close to the ground , and list if thou canst hear the tread of travelers .
’Tis a strange serpent .
Have you any levers to lift me up again being down Sblood , I’ll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin in thy father’s Exchequer . What a plague mean you to colt me thus
’Tis so . And the tears of it are wet .
Thou liest . Thou art not colted thou art uncolted .
Will this description satisfy him
I prithee , good Prince Hal , help me to my horse , good king’s son .
With the health that Pompey gives him , else he is a very epicure .
Out , you rogue Shall I be your ostler
Hang thyself in thine own heir apparent garters If I be ta en , I’ll peach for this . An I have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy tunes , let a cup of sack be my poison when a jest is so forward , and afoot too I hate it .
Go hang , sir , hang Tell me of that Away Do as I bid you . Where’s this cup I called for
If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me , Rise from thy stool .
I think th’ art mad .
Wilt thou rest damned God help thee , shallow man . God make incision in thee thou art raw .
The matter
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
Sir , I am a true laborer . I earn that I eat , get that I wear , owe no man hate , envy no man’s happiness , glad of other men’s good , content with my harm , and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck .
Thou hast served me with much faith . What’s else to say Be jolly , lords .
That is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match . If thou be’st not damned for this , the devil himself will have no shepherds . I cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape .
These quicksands , Lepidus , Keep off them , for you sink .
Here comes young Master Ganymede , my new mistress’s brother .
Wilt thou be lord of all the world
From the east to western Ind , No jewel is like Rosalind . Her worth being mounted on the wind , Through all the world bears Rosalind . All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind . Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind .
Thou art Dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
I am an ass , I am a woman’s man , and besides myself .
What woman’s man And how besides thyself
Marry , sir , besides myself I am due to a woman , one that claims me , one that haunts me , one that will have me .
What claim lays she to thee
Marry , sir , such claim as you would lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not that I being a beast she would have me , but that she , being a very beastly creature , lays claim to me .
What is she
A very reverent body , ay , such a one as a man may not speak of without he say sir reverence . I have but lean luck in the match , and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage .
How dost thou mean a fat marriage
Marry , sir , she’s the kitchen wench , and all grease , and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light . I warrant her rags and the
No fifteen hundred foot , five hundred horse Are marched up to my Lord of Lancaster Against Northumberland and the Archbishop .
Comes the King back from Wales , my noble lord
You shall have letters of me presently . Come . Go along with me , good Master Gower .
My lord
What’s the matter
Master Gower , shall I entreat you with me to dinner
I must wait upon my good lord here . I thank you , good Sir John .
Sir John , you loiter here too long , being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go .
Will you sup with me , Master Gower
What foolish master taught you these manners , Sir John
Master Gower , if they become me not , he was a fool that taught them me . This is the right fencing grace , my lord tap for tap , and so part fair .
Now the Lord lighten thee . Thou art a great fool .
How lies their battle know you on which side They have placed their men of trust
As I guess , Martius , Their bands i’ the vaward are the Antiates , Of their best trust o’er them Aufidius , Their very heart of hope .
I do beseech you , By all the battles wherein we have fought , By the blood we have shed together , by the vows We have made to endure friends , that you directly Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates And that you not delay the present , but , Filling the air with swords advanced and darts , We prove this very hour .
Though I could wish You were conducted to a gentle bath And balms applied to , you , yet dare I never Deny your asking take your choice of those That best can aid your action .
Those are they That most are willing . If any such be here As it were sin to doubt that love this painting Wherein you see me smear’d if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report If any think brave death outweighs bad life And that his country’s dearer than himself Let him alone , or so many so minded , Wave thus , to express his disposition , And follow Martius .
I’ll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted . It is the right butter women’s rank to market .
Out , fool .
For a taste If a hart do lack a hind , Let him seek out Rosalind . If the cat will after kind , So , be sure , will Rosalind . Winter garments must be lined , So must slender Rosalind . They that reap must sheaf and bind , Then to cart with Rosalind . Sweetest nut hath sourest rind Such a nut is Rosalind . He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick , and Rosalind . This is the very false gallop of verses . Why do you infect yourself with them
Peace , you dull fool . I found them on a tree .
What sayst thou
Truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world That’s twice .
I’ll graft it with you , and then I shall graft it with a medlar . Then it will be the earliest fruit i th country , for you’ll be rotten ere you be half ripe , and that’s the right virtue of the medlar .
How should that be
But entertain it , And , though thou think me poor , I am the man Will give thee all the world .
Stand .
So I do , against my will .
O , ’tis our setter . I know his voice , Bardolph . What news
Case you , case you . On with your vizards . There’s money of the King’s coming down the hill . Tis going to the King’s Exchequer .
You lie , you rogue . Tis going to the King’s Tavern .
There’s enough to make us all .
To be hanged .
Sirs , you four shall front them in the narrow lane . Ned Poins and I will walk lower . If they ’scape from your encounter , then they light on us .
How many be there of them
Some eight or ten .
Zounds , will they not rob us
What , a coward , Sir John Paunch
Indeed , I am not John of Gaunt , your grandfather , but yet no coward , Hal .
Well , we leave that to the proof .
Hast thou drunk well
No , Pompey , I have kept me from the cup . Thou art , if thou dar’st be , the earthly Jove . Whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips Is thine , if thou wilt ha ’t .
Show me which way .
These three world sharers , these competitors , Are in thy vessel . Let me cut the cable , And , when we are put off , fall to their throats . All there is thine .
Ah , this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t In me ’tis villainy , In thee ’t had been good service . Thou must know , ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor Mine honor , it . Repent that e’er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act . Being done unknown , I should have found it afterwards well done , But must condemn it now . Desist , and drink .
For this , I’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more . Who seeks and will not take when once ’tis offered Shall never find it more .
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark .
Heaven will direct it .
Nay , let’s follow him .
You have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
Peace . Here comes my sister reading . Stand aside .
tallow in them will burn a Poland winter . If she lives till doomsday , she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world .
What complexion is she of
Swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept . For why She sweats . A man may go overshoes in the grime of it .
That’s a fault that water will mend .
Why should this a desert be For it is unpeopled No . Tongues I’ll hang on every tree That shall civil sayings show . Some how brief the life of man Runs his erring pilgrimage , That the stretching of a span Buckles in his sum of age Some of violated vows Twixt the souls of friend and friend . But upon the fairest boughs , Or at every sentence end , Will I Rosalinda write , Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show . Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide enlarged . Nature presently distilled Helen’s cheek , but not her heart , Cleopatra’s majesty , Atalanta’s better part , Sad Lucretia’s modesty .
No , sir , ’tis in grain Noah’s flood could not do it .
What’s her name
Nell , sir , but her name and three quarters that’s an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hip .
Then she bears some breadth
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip . She is spherical , like a globe . I could find out countries in her .
In what part of her body stands Ireland
Before God , I am exceeding weary .
Marry , sir , in her buttocks . I found it out by the bogs .
Is ’t come to that I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood .
Where Scotland
Faith , it does me though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it . Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer
Why , a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition .
Belike then my appetite was not princely got , for , by my troth , I do now remember the poor creature small beer . But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness . What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name , or to know thy face tomorrow , or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast with these , and those that were thy peach colored ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts , as , one for superfluity and another for use . But that the tennis court keeper knows better than I , for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there , as thou hast not done a great while , because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit His kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault , whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened .
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised , Of many faces , eyes , and hearts To have the touches dearest prized . Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave .
O most gentle Jupiter , what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal , and never cried , Have patience , good people .
Sirrah Jack , thy horse stands behind the hedge . When thou needest him , there thou shalt find him . Farewell , and stand fast .
How now Back , friends . Shepherd , go off a little . Go with him , sirrah .
Now cannot I strike him , if I should be hanged .
Come , shepherd , let us make an honorable retreat , though not with bag and baggage , yet with scrip and scrippage .
Ned , where are our disguises
Didst thou hear these verses
Here , hard by . Stand close .
Oh , yes , I heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
Now , my masters , happy man be his dole , say I . Every man to his business .
That’s no matter . The feet might bear the verses .
Ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse , and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
Come , neighbor , the boy shall lead our horses down the hill . We’ll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs .
Stand
Jesus bless us
Strike Down with them Cut the villains throats Ah , whoreson caterpillars , bacon fed knaves , they hate us youth . Down with them Fleece them
O , we are undone , both we and ours forever
Hang , you gorbellied knaves Are you undone No , you fat chuffs . I would your store were here . On , bacons , on What , you knaves , young men must live . You are grandjurors , are you We’ll jure you , faith .
I found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand .
How ill it follows , after you have labored so hard , you should talk so idly Tell me , how many good young princes would do so , their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is
Where France
Shall I tell thee one thing , Poins
And of women .
Nay , that he did not .
Yes , that he did , and said they were devils incarnate .
A could never abide carnation . Twas a color he never liked .
He said once the devil would have him about women .
In her forehead , armed and reverted , making war against her heir .
Where England
I looked for the chalky cliffs , but I could find no whiteness in them . But I guess it stood in her chin , by the salt rheum that ran between France and it .
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees
Where Spain
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came , for look here what I found on a palm tree . I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras time , that I was an Irish rat , which I can hardly remember .
Trow you who hath done this
Faith , I saw it not , but I felt it hot in her breath .
Is it a man
Where America , the Indies
And a chain , that you once wore , about his neck . Change you color
I prithee , who
O Lord , Lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
Nay , but who is it
Is it possible
Nay , I prithee now , with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
O wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping
Where wilt thou lead me Speak , I’ll go no further .
Mark me .
I will .
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself .
Alas , poor ghost
Pity me not , but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold .
Speak . I am bound to hear .
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear .
What
I am thy father’s spirit , Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires , Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away . But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house , I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul , freeze thy young blood ,
This health to Lepidus
Yes , faith , and let it be an excellent good thing .
Bear him ashore . I’ll pledge it for him , Pompey .
It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine .
Here’s to thee , Menas
Go to . I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell .
Enobarbus , welcome .
Marry , I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad , now my father is sick albeit I could tell thee , as to one it pleases me , for fault of a better , to call my friend , I could be sad , and sad indeed too .
Fill till the cup be hid .
There’s a strong fellow , Menas .
Very hardly , upon such a subject .
Why
By this hand , thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency . Let the end try the man . But I tell thee , my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow .
The reason
He bears The third part of the world , man . Seest not
What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep
The third part , then , is drunk . Would it were all , That it might go on wheels
Drink thou . Increase the reels .
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite .
Come .
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast .
It ripens towards it . Strike the vessels , ho Here’s to Caesar .
I could well forbear ’t . It’s monstrous labor when I wash my brain And it grows fouler .
The thieves have bound the true men . Now could thou and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London , it would be argument for a week , laughter for a month , and a good jest forever .
He did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the Whore of Babylon .
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph’s nose , and he said it was a black soul burning in hell
Stand close , I hear them coming .
Come , my masters , let us share , and then to horse before day . An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards , there’s no equity stirring . There’s no more valor in that Poins than in a wild duck .
Your money
Villains
Got with much ease . Now merrily to horse . The thieves are all scattered , and possessed with fear So strongly that they dare not meet each other . Each takes his fellow for an officer . Away , good Ned . Falstaff sweats to death , And lards the lean earth as he walks along . Were ’t not for laughing , I should pity him .
Good my complexion , dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man , I have a doublet and hose in my disposition One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery . I prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace . I would thou couldst stammer , that thou might’st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouthed bottle either too much at once , or none at all . I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that I may drink thy tidings .
So you may put a man in your belly .
Is he of God’s making What manner of man Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
Nay , he hath but a little beard .
Why , God will send more , if the man will be thankful . Let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
It is young Orlando , that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant .
Nay , but the devil take mocking . Speak sad brow and true maid .
I faith , coz , ’tis he .
Orlando
Orlando .
O , me alone make you a sword of me If these shows be not outward , which of you But is four Volsces none of you but is Able to bear against the great Aufidius A shield as hard as his . A certain number , Though thanks to all , must I select from all the rest Shall bear the business in some other fight , As cause will be obey’d . Please you to march And four shall quickly draw out my command , Which men are best inclined .
Well , the fuel is gone that maintained that fire . That’s all the riches I got in his service .
March on , my fellows Make good this ostentation , and you shall Divide in all with us .
Shall we shog The King will be gone from Southampton .
Come , let’s away . My love , give me thy lips . Look to my chattels and my movables . Let senses rule . The word is Pitch and pay . Trust none , for oaths are straws , men’s faiths are wafer cakes , And Holdfast is the only dog , my duck . Therefore , caveto be thy counselor . Go , clear thy crystals . Yoke fellows in arms , Let us to France , like horse leeches , my boys , To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .
Be a child o’ th’ time .
Possess it , I’ll make answer . But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one .
Make thy two eyes , like stars , start from their spheres , Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end , Like quills upon the fearful porpentine . But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood . List , list , O , list If thou didst ever thy dear father love
O God
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
Murder
Murder most foul , as in the best it is . But this most foul , strange and unnatural .
Haste me to know ’t , that I , with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love , May sweep to my revenge .
I find thee apt , And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf , Wouldst thou not stir in this . Now , Hamlet , hear . Tis given out that , sleeping in my orchard , A serpent stung me . So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forgèd process of my death Rankly abused . But know , thou noble youth , The serpent that did sting thy father’s life Now wears his crown .
O my prophetic soul My uncle
Alas the day , what shall I do with my doublet and hose What did he when thou saw’st him What said he How looked he Wherein went he What makes him here Did he ask for me Where remains he How parted he with thee And when shalt thou see him again Answer me in one word .
You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first . Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size . To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism .
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover . But take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance . I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .
It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit .
Give me audience , good madam .
Proceed .
There lay he , stretched along like a wounded knight .
Though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
Ha My brave emperor , Shall we dance now the Egyptian bacchanals And celebrate our drink
Let’s ha ’t , good soldier .
Come , let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe .
All take hands . Make battery to our ears with the loud music , The while I’ll place you then the boy shall sing . The holding every man shall beat as loud As his strong sides can volley .
Come , thou monarch of the vine , Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne In thy vats our cares be drowned , With thy grapes our hairs be crowned .
Cup us till the world go round ,  Cup us till the world go round
What would you more Pompey , good night . Good brother , Let me request you off . Our graver business Frowns at this levity . Gentle lords , let’s part . You see we have burnt our cheeks . Strong Enobarb Is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks . The wild disguise hath almost Anticked us all . What needs more words Good night . Good Antony , your hand .
O , sir , upon her nose , all o er embellished with rubies , carbuncles , sapphires , declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain , who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose .
Where stood Belgia , the Netherlands
O , sir , I did not look so low . To conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me , call’d me Dromio , swore I was assured to her , told me what privy marks I had about me , as the mark of my shoulder , the mole in my neck , the great wart on my left arm , that I , amazed , ran from her as a witch . And , I think , if my breast had not been made of faith , and my heart of steel , She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i th wheel .
Go , hie thee presently . Post to the road . An if the wind blow any way from shore , I will not harbor in this town tonight . If any bark put forth , come to the mart , Where I will walk till thou return to me . If every one knows us , and we know none , Tis time , I think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .
As from a bear a man would run for life , So fly I from her that would be my wife .
There’s none but witches do inhabit here , And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence . She that doth call me husband , even my soul Doth for a wife abhor . But her fair sister , Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace ,
It would be every man’s thought , and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks . Never a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine . Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed . And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so
Why , because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff .
And to thee .
By this light , I am well spoke on . I can hear it with my own ears . The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother , and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those two things , I confess , I cannot help . By the Mass , here comes Bardolph .
And the boy that I gave Falstaff . He had him from me Christian , and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape .
God save your Grace .
Cry holla to thy tongue , I prithee . It curvets unseasonably . He was furnished like a hunter .
And yours , most noble Bardolph .
Oh , ominous He comes to kill my heart .
Come , you virtuous ass , you bashful fool , must you be blushing Wherefore blush you now What a maidenly man at arms are you become Is ’t such a matter to get a pottle pot’s maidenhead
I would sing my song without a burden . Thou bring’st me out of tune .
Do you not know I am a woman When I think , I must speak . Sweet , say on .
You bring me out . Soft , comes he not here
Tis he . Slink by , and note him .
I thank you for your company , but , good faith , I had as lief have been myself alone .
And so had I , but yet , for fashion sake , I thank you too for your society .
God be wi you . Let’s meet as little as we can .
I do desire we may be better strangers .
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favoredly .
Ay , that incestuous , that adulterate beast , With witchcraft of his wit , with traitorous gifts O wicked wit and gifts , that have the power So to seduce won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming virtuous queen . O Hamlet , what a falling off was there From me , whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage , and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine . But virtue , as it never will be moved , Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven , So lust , though to a radiant angel linked , Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage . But soft Methinks I scent the morning air . Brief let me be . Sleeping within my orchard , My custom always of the afternoon , Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial , And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment , whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body And with a sudden vigor doth posset And curd , like eager droppings into milk , The thin and wholesome blood . So did it mine . And a most instant tetter barked about , Most lazar like , with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body . Thus was I , sleeping , by a brother’s hand Of life , of crown , of queen at once dispatched , Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin ,
How the fat rogue roared
Rosalind is your love’s name
Yes , just .
I do not like her name .
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened .
What stature is she of
I’ll try you on the shore .
Just as high as my heart .
And shall , sir . Give ’s your hand .
You are full of pretty answers . Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of rings
O Antony , You have my father’s house . But what We are friends . Come , down into the boat .
Not so . But I answer you right painted cloth , from whence you have studied your questions .
Take heed you fall not .
You have a nimble wit . I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels . Will you sit down with me And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery .
Menas , I’ll not on shore .
I will chide no breather in the world but myself , against whom I know most faults .
No , to my cabin . These drums , these trumpets , flutes What Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great fellows . Sound and be hanged , sound out
The worst fault you have is to be in love .
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue . I am weary of you .
Hoo says ’a . There’s my cap .
And that’s but unwholesome food , they say .
Hoo Noble captain , come .
Touch her soft mouth , and march .
Of such enchanting presence and discourse , Hath almost made me traitor to myself . But lest myself be guilty to self wrong , I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song .
Master Antipholus .
Ay , that’s my name .
I know it well , sir . Lo , here’s the chain . I thought to have ta en you at the Porpentine The chain unfinished made me stay thus long .
What is your will that I shall do with this
What please yourself , sir . I have made it for you .
Made it for me , sir I bespoke it not .
Not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have . Go home with it and please your wife withal , And soon at supper time I’ll visit you And then receive my money for the chain .
I pray you , sir , receive the money now , For fear you ne er see chain nor money more .
You are a merry man , sir . Fare you well .
What I should think of this I cannot tell , But this I think there’s no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain .
Farewell , hostess .
I cannot kiss , that is the humor of it . But adieu .
Let housewifery appear . Keep close , I thee command .
Farewell . Adieu .
He calls me e en now , my lord , through a red lattice , and I could discern no part of his face from the window . At last I spied his eyes , and methought he had made two holes in the ale wife’s new petticoat and so peeped through .
Has not the boy profited
Away , you whoreson upright rabbit , away
Away , you rascally Althea’s dream , away
Instruct us , boy . What dream , boy
Marry , my lord , Althea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand , and therefore I call him her dream .
A crown’s worth of good interpretation . There ’tis , boy .
O , that this good blossom could be kept from cankers Well , there is sixpence to preserve thee .
An you do not make him hanged among you , the gallows shall have wrong .
And how doth thy master , Bardolph
Unhouseled , disappointed , unaneled . No reckoning made , but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head . Oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible If thou hast nature in thee , bear it not . Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damnèd incest . But howsoever thou pursuest this act , Taint not thy mind , nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught . Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her . Fare thee well at once . The glowworm shows the matin to be near , And gins to pale his uneffectual fire . Adieu , adieu , adieu . Remember me .
Well , my good lord . He heard of your Grace’s coming to town . There’s a letter for you .
Delivered with good respect . And how doth the Martlemas your master
In bodily health , sir .
O all you host of heaven O earth What else And shall I couple hell Oh , fie Hold , hold , my heart , And you , my sinews , grow not instant old , But bear me stiffly up . Remember thee Ay , thou poor ghost , whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe . Remember thee Yea , from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records , All saws of books , all forms , all pressures past That youth and observation copied there , And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain , Unmixed with baser matter . Yes , by heaven O most pernicious woman O villain , villain , smiling , damnèd villain My tables Meet it is I set it down That one may smile , and smile , and be a villain . At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark . So , uncle , there you are . Now to my word .
So , let the ports be guarded keep your duties , As I have set them down . If I do send , dispatch Those centuries to our aid the rest will serve For a short holding if we lose the field , We cannot keep the town .
Fear not our care , sir .
Hence , and shut your gates upon’s . Our guider , come to the Roman camp conduct us .
By my troth , I was seeking for a fool when I found you .
He is drowned in the brook . Look but in , and you shall see him .
There I shall see mine own figure .
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher .
I’ll tarry no longer with you . Farewell , good Signior Love .
I am glad of your departure . Adieu , good Monsieur Melancholy .
I will speak to him like a saucy lackey , and under that habit play the knave with him . Do you hear , forester
Very well . What would you
I pray you , what is ’t o clock
You should ask me what time o day . There’s no clock in the forest .
Then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
Now , darting Parthia , art thou struck , and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death Make me revenger . Bear the King’s son’s body Before our army . Thy Pacorus , Orodes , Pays this for Marcus Crassus .
Noble Ventidius , Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm , The fugitive Parthians follow . Spur through Media , Mesopotamia , and the shelters whither The routed fly . So thy grand captain , Antony , Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and Put garlands on thy head .
O Silius , Silius , I have done enough . A lower place , note well , May make too great an act . For learn this , Silius Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away . Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person . Sossius , One of my place in Syria , his lieutenant , For quick accumulation of renown , Which he achieved by th’ minute , lost his favor . Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain’s captain and ambition , The soldier’s virtue , rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him . I could do more to do Antonius good , But ’twould offend him , and in his offense Should my performance perish .
I see a man here needs not live by shifts When in the streets he meets such golden gifts . I’ll to the mart , and there for Dromio stay . If any ship put out , then straight away .
It is Adieu , adieu . Remember me . I have sworn ’t .
And why not the swift foot of time Had not that been as proper
By no means , sir . Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons . I’ll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .
My lord , my lord
I prithee , who doth he trot withal
Lord Hamlet
Marry , he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized . If the interim be but a se nnight , time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year .
Heaven secure him
Who ambles time withal
So be it .
Illo , ho , ho , my lord
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout , for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning , the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury . These time ambles withal .
Hillo , ho , ho , boy . Come , bird , come .
Who doth he gallop withal
How is ’t , my noble lord
With a thief to the gallows , for though he go as softly as foot can fall , he thinks himself too soon there .
What news , my lord
Who stays it still withal
Oh , wonderful
With lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .
Good my lord , tell it .
No . You’ll reveal it .
Not I , my lord , by heaven .
Nor I , my lord .
How say you , then Would heart of man once think it But you’ll be secret
Marry , the immortal part needs a physician , but that moves not him . Though that be sick , it dies not .
Ay , by heaven , my lord .

John Falstaff , knight . Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself , even like those that are kin to the King , for they never prick their finger but they say , There’s some of the King’s blood spilt . How comes that says he that takes upon him not to conceive . The answer is as ready as a borrower’s cap I am the King’s poor cousin , sir .
Nay , they will be kin to us , or they will fetch it from Japheth . But to the letter . Sir John alstaff , knight , to the son of the King nearest his father , Harry Prince of Wales , greeting .
Why , this is a certificate .
Peace I will imitate the honorable Romans in brevity .
He sure means brevity in breath , short winded .
I commend me to thee , I commend thee , and I leave thee . Be not too familiar with Poins , for he misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister
Thou hast , Ventidius , that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction . Thou wilt write to Antony
I’ll humbly signify what in his name , That magical word of war , we have effected How with his banners and his well paid ranks The ne’er yet beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field .
Where is he now
He purposeth to Athens , whither , with what haste The weight we must convey with’s will permit , We shall appear before him . On , there . Pass along
Where dwell you , pretty youth
With this shepherdess , my sister , here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat .
Are you native of this place
Thus comes the English with full power upon us , And more than carefully it us concerns To answer royally in our defenses . Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany , Of Brabant and of Orléans , shall make forth , And you , Prince Dauphin , with all swift dispatch , To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant . For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf . It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fields .
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
To view the sick and feeble parts of France . And let us do it with no show of fear , No , with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris dance . For , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , That fear attends her not . My most redoubted father , It is most meet we arm us gainst the foe , For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom , Though war nor no known quarrel were in question , But that defenses , musters , preparations , Should be maintained , assembled , and collected , As were a war in expectation . Therefore I say ’tis meet we all go forth
I have been told so of many . But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love . I have heard him read many lectures against it , and I thank God I am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women
There were none principal . They were all like one another as half pence are , every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it .
I prithee , recount some of them .
You know since Pentecost the sum is due , And since I have not much importuned you , Nor now I had not , but that I am bound To Persia , and want guilders for my voyage . Therefore make present satisfaction , Or I’ll attach you by this officer .
I’ll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee Worse than a promise breaker .
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus . And in the instant that I met with you , He had of me a chain . At five o clock I shall receive the money for the same . Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house , I will discharge my bond and thank you too .
We hate alike Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor More than thy fame and envy . Fix thy foot .
Let the first budger die the other’s slave , And the gods doom him after
That labor may you save . See where he comes .
If I fly , Martius , Holloa me like a hare .
While I go to the goldsmith’s house , go thou And buy a rope’s end . That will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates For locking me out of my doors by day . But soft . I see the goldsmith . Get thee gone . Buy thou a rope , and bring it home to me .
Within these three hours , Tullus , Alone I fought in your Corioli walls , And made what work I pleased ’tis not my blood Wherein thou seest me mask’d for thy revenge Wrench up thy power to the highest .
Wert thou the Hector That was the whip of your bragg’d progeny , Thou shouldst not scape me here .
Officious , and not valiant , you have shamed me In your condemned seconds .
What , are the brothers parted
They have dispatched with Pompey he is gone . The other three are sealing . Octavia weeps To part from Rome . Caesar is sad , and Lepidus , Since Pompey’s feast , as Menas says , is troubled With the greensickness .
’Tis a noble Lepidus .
A very fine one . Oh , how he loves Caesar
Nay , but how dearly he adores Mark Antony
Caesar Why , he’s the Jupiter of men .
What’s Antony The god of Jupiter .
But , for mine own part , my lord , I could be well contented to be there , in respect of the love I bear your house . He could be contented why is he not , then In respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house . Let me see some more . The purpose you undertake is dangerous . Why , that’s certain . Tis dangerous to take a cold , to sleep , to drink but I tell you , my lord fool , out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety . The purpose you undertake is dangerous , the friends you have named uncertain , the time itself unsorted , and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition . Say you so , say you so I say unto you again , you are a shallow , cowardly hind , and you lie . What a lack brain is this By the Lord , our plot is a good plot as ever was laid , our friends true and constant a good plot , good friends , and full of expectation an excellent plot , very good friends . What a frosty spirited rogue is this Why , my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action . Zounds , an I were now by this rascal , I could brain him with his lady’s fan . Is there not my father , my uncle , and myself Lord Edmund Mortimer , my Lord of York , and Owen Glendower Is there not besides the Douglas Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month , and are they not some of them set forward already What a pagan rascal is this an infidel Ha , you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart , will he to the King and lay open all our proceedings . O , I could divide myself and go to buffets , for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honorable an action Hang him , let him tell the King . We are prepared . I will set forward tonight .
Spake you of Caesar How , the nonpareil
O Antony , O thou Arabian bird
Would you praise Caesar , say Caesar . Go no further .
Indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
But he loves Caesar best yet he loves Antony . Hoo Hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , cannot Think , speak , cast , write , sing , number hoo His love to Antony . But as for Caesar , Kneel down , kneel down , and wonder .
Both he loves .
They are his shards , and he their beetleShard beetles make their home in dung heaps . their beetle .
Nell . Repent at idle times as thou mayest , and so , farewell . Thine by yea and no , which is as much as to say , as thou usest him , Jack Falstaff with my familiars , John with my brothers and sisters , and Sir John with all Europe .
My lord , I’ll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it .
That’s to make him eat twenty of his words . But do you use me thus , Ned Must I marry your sister
God send the wench no worse fortune But I never said so .
Well , thus we play the fools with the time , and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us . Is your master here in London
Yea , my lord .
Where sups he Doth the old boar feed in the old frank
No , I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick . There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of Rosalind . If I could meet that fancy monger I would give him some good counsel , for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him .
At the old place , my lord , in Eastcheap .
I am he that is so love shaked . I pray you tell me your remedy .
What company
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you . He taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner .
Ephesians , my lord , of the old church .
What were his marks
Sup any women with him
A lean cheek , which you have not a blue eye and sunken , which you have not an unquestionable spirit , which you have not a beard neglected , which you have not but I pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue . Then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation . But you are no such man . You are rather point device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
None , my lord , but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet .
Fair youth , I would I could make thee believe I love .
There’s ne er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave .
I buy a thousand pound a year I buy a rope
There needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave To tell us this .
A man is well holp up that trusts to you I promisèd your presence and the chain , But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me . Belike you thought our love would last too long If it were chained together , and therefore came not .
Why , right , you are in the right . And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands and part . You , as your business and desire shall point you For every man has business and desire , Such as it is and for my own poor part , Look you , I’ll go pray .
Saving your merry humor , here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat , The fineness of the gold , and chargeful fashion , Which doth amount to three odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman . I pray you , see him presently discharged , For he is bound to sea , and stays but for it .
These are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
I am not furnished with the present money . Besides , I have some business in the town . Good signior , take the stranger to my house , And with you take the chain , and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof . Perchance I will be there as soon as you .
I’m sorry they offend you , heartily . Yes faith , heartily .
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
There’s no offense , my lord .
No , bear it with you lest I come not time enough .
Yes , by Saint Patrick , but there is , Horatio , And much offense too . Touching this vision here , It is an honest ghost , that let me tell you . For your desire to know what is between us , O ermaster ’t as you may . And now , good friends , As you are friends , scholars and soldiers , Give me one poor request .
Well , sir , I will . Have you the chain about you
An if I have not , sir , I hope you have , Or else you may return without your money .
If I should tell thee o’er this thy day’s work , Thou’ldst not believe thy deeds but I’ll report it Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles , Where great patricians shall attend and shrug , I’ the end admire , where ladies shall be frighted , And , gladly quaked , hear more where the dull tribunes , That , with the fusty plebeians , hate thine honours , Shall say against their hearts ‘We thank the gods Our Rome hath such a soldier . ’ Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast , Having fully dined before .
O general , Here is the steed , we the caparison Hadst thou beheld
Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love believe it , which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does . That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences . But , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired
I swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of Rosalind , I am that he , that unfortunate he .
Pray now , no more my mother , Who has a charter to extol her blood , When she does praise me grieves me . I have done As you have done that’s what I can induced As you have been that’s for my country He that has but effected his good will Hath overta’en mine act .
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
Love is merely a madness and , I tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too . Yet I profess curing it by counsel .
Did you ever cure any so
How now , Kate I must leave you within these two hours .
O my good lord , why are you thus alone For what offense have I this fortnight been A banished woman from my Harry’s bed Tell me , sweet lord , what is ’t that takes from thee Thy stomach , pleasure , and thy golden sleep Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth And start so often when thou sit’st alone Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks And given my treasures and my rights of thee To thick eyed musing and curst melancholy In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched , And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars , Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed , Cry Courage To the field And thou hast talk’d Of sallies and retires , of trenches , tents , Of palisadoes , frontiers , parapets , Of basilisks , of cannon , culverin , Of prisoners ransom and of soldiers slain , And all the currents of a heady fight . Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war , And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep , That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow Like bubbles in a late disturbèd stream , And in thy face strange motions have appeared , Such as we see when men restrain their breath On some great sudden hest . O , what portents are these Some heavy business hath my lord in hand , And I must know it , else he loves me not .
What , ho
What is ’t , my lord We will .
Never make known what you have seen tonight .
My lord , we will not .
Yes , one , and in this manner . He was to imagine me his love , his mistress , and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I , being but a moonish youth , grieve , be effeminate , changeable , longing and liking , proud , fantastical , apish , shallow , inconstant , full of tears , full of smiles for every passion something , and for no passion truly anything , as boys and women are , for the most part , cattle of this color would now like him , now loathe him then entertain him , then forswear him now weep for him , then spit at him , that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness , which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic . And thus I cured him , and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart , that there shall not be one spot of love in ’t .
I would not be cured , youth .
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
Now , by the faith of my love , I will . Tell me where it is .
Go with me to it , and I’ll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live . Will you go
With all my heart , good youth .
Nay , you must call me Rosalind . Come , sister , will you go
Nay , come , I pray you , sir , give me the chain . Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman , And I , to blame , have held him here too long .
Good Lord You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine . I should have chid you for not bringing it , But , like a shrew , you first begin to brawl .
The hour steals on . I pray you , sir , dispatch .
You hear how he importunes me . The chain
Why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
So , This is to horse . Adieu , noble Agrippa .
Come , come . You know I gave it you even now . Either send the chain , or send me by some token .
Good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
Fie , now you run this humor out of breath . Come , where’s the chain I pray you , let me see it .
My business cannot brook this dalliance . Good sir , say whe er you’ll answer me or no . If not , I’ll leave him to the Officer .
No further , sir .
I answer you What should I answer you
The money that you owe me for the chain .
You take from me a great part of myself Use me well in ’t . Sister , prove such a wife As my thoughts make thee , and as my farthest bond Shall pass on thy approof . Most noble Antony , Let not the piece of virtue , which is set Betwixt us as the cement of our love , To keep it builded , be the ram to batter The fortress of it . For better might we Have loved without this mean , if on both parts This be not cherished .
I owe you none till I receive the chain .
Make me not offended In your distrust .
You know I gave it you half an hour since .
I have said .
You shall not find , Though you be therein curious , the least cause For what you seem to fear . So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends . We will here part .
Is Gilliams with the packet gone
Come apace , good Audrey . I will fetch up your goats , Audrey . And how , Audrey Am I the man yet Doth my simple feature content you
He is , my lord , an hour ago .
Your features , Lord warrant us What features
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff
I am here with thee and thy goats , as the most capricious poet , honest Ovid , was among the Goths .
One horse , my lord , he brought even now .
O knowledge ill inhabited , worse than Jove in a thatched house .
What horse A roan , a crop ear , is it not
When a man’s verses cannot be understood nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child , understanding , it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room . Truly , I would the gods had made thee poetical .
It is , my lord .
I do not know what poetical is . Is it honest in deed and word Is it a true thing
That roan shall be my throne . Well , I will back him straight . O , Esperance Bid Butler lead him forth into the park .
No , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
But hear you , my lord .
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
What say’st thou , my lady
I do , truly , for thou swear’st to me thou art honest . Now , if thou wert a poet , I might have some hope thou didst feign .
What is it carries you away
Why , my horse , My love , my horse .
Out , you mad headed ape A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen As you are tossed with . In faith , I’ll know your business , Harry , that I will . I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir About his title , and hath sent for you To line his enterprise but if you go
Oh peace , Prince Dauphin You are too much mistaken in this king . Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy , How well supplied with noble counselors , How modest in exception , and withal How terrible in constant resolution , And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus , Covering discretion with a coat of folly , As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate .
Well , ’tis not so , my Lord High Constable . But though we think it so , it is no matter . In cases of defense ’tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems . So the proportions of defense are filled , Which of a weak or niggardly projection Doth , like a miser , spoil his coat with scanting A little cloth .
Farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well . The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort Fare thee well .
My noble brother
Think we King Harry strong , And , princes , look you strongly arm to meet him . The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us , And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths . Witness our too much memorable shame When Cressy battle fatally was struck And all our princes captived by the hand Of that black name , Edward , Black Prince of Wales , Whiles that his mountain sire , on mountain standing
The April’s in her eyes it is love’s spring , And these the showers to bring it on . Be cheerful .
Sir , look well to my husband’s house , and
What , Octavia
You shall not be The grave of your deserving Rome must know The value of her own ’twere a concealment Worse than a theft , no less than a traducement , To hide your doings and to silence that , Which , to the spire and top of praises vouch’d , Would seem but modest therefore , I beseech you In sign of what you are , not to reward What you have done before our army hear me .
I have some wounds upon me , and they smart To hear themselves remember’d .
Should they not , Well might they fester ’gainst ingratitude , And tent themselves with death . Of all the horses , Whereof we have ta’en good and good store , of all The treasure in this field achieved and city , We render you the tenth , to be ta’en forth , Before the common distribution , at Your only choice .
I thank you , general But cannot make my heart consent to take A bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it And stand upon my common part with those That have beheld the doing .
Nay , but swear ’t .
In faith , my lord , not I .
Nor I , my lord , in faith .
Upon my sword .
We have sworn , my lord , already .
What pagan may that be
Would you not have me honest
Indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
A proper gentlewoman , sir , and a kinswoman of my master’s .
No , truly , unless thou wert hard favored , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
Swear
A material fool .
Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull . Shall we steal upon them , Ned , at supper
Ha , ha , boy Sayst thou so Art thou there , truepenny Come on , you hear this fellow in the cellarage . Consent to swear .
Well , I am not fair , and therefore I pray the gods make me honest .
I am your shadow , my lord . I’ll follow you .
Propose the oath , my lord .
Truly , and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish .
Sirrah you , boy and Bardolph , no word to your master that I am yet come to town . There’s for your silence .
Never to speak of this that you have seen . Swear by my sword .
I am not a slut , though I thank the gods I am foul .
You gave me none . You wrong me much to say so .
I have no tongue , sir .
Swear .
You wrong me more , sir , in denying it . Consider how it stands upon my credit .
And for mine , sir , I will govern it .
Well , praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter . But be it as it may be , I will marry thee and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext , the vicar of the next village , who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us .
Well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
Fare you well . Go .
I would fain see this meeting .
Hic et ubique Then we’ll shift our ground . Come hither , gentlemen , And lay your hands again upon my sword . Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard .
I do , and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me .
Well , the gods give us joy .
Swear by his sword .
This touches me in reputation . Either consent to pay this sum for me , Or I attach you by this officer .
Well said , old mole Canst work i th earth so fast A worthy pioneer Once more remove , good friends .
Amen . A man may , if he were of a fearful heart , stagger in this attempt , for here we have no temple but the wood , no assembly but horn beasts . But what though Courage . As horns are odious , they are necessary . It is said , Many a man knows no end of his goods . Right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them .
Consent to pay thee that I never had Arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou dar’st .
Here is thy fee . Arrest him , officer . I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently .
I do arrest you , sir . You hear the suit .
I do obey thee till I give thee bail . But , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer .
Sir , sir , I will have law in Ephesus , To your notorious shame , I doubt it not .
I’ll tell you in your ear .
Her tongue will not obey her heart , nor can Her heart inform her tongue the swan’s down feather That stands upon the swell at the full of tide And neither way inclines .
Will Caesar weep
He has a cloud in ’s face .
He were the worse for that , were he a horse So is he , being a man .
Why , Enobarbus , When Antony found Julius Caesar dead , He cried almost to roaring , and he wept When at Philippi he found Brutus slain .
So far afoot , I shall be weary , love .
Come , come , you paraquito , answer me Directly unto this question that I ask . In faith , I’ll break thy little finger , Harry , An if thou wilt not tell me all things true .
Away Away , you trifler . Love , I love thee not . I care not for thee , Kate . This is no world To play with mammets and to tilt with lips . We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns , And pass them current too . Gods me , my horse What say’st thou , Kate What would’st thou have with me
Do you not love me Do you not indeed Well , do not then , for since you love me not , I will not love myself . Do you not love me Nay , tell me if you speak in jest or no .
Come , wilt thou see me ride And when I am a horseback , I will swear I love thee infinitely . But hark you , Kate , I must not have you henceforth question me Whither I go , nor reason whereabout . Whither I must , I must and to conclude , This evening must I leave you , gentle Kate . I know you wise , but yet no farther wise Than Harry Percy’s wife constant you are , But yet a woman and for secrecy No lady closer , for I well believe Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know , And so far will I trust thee , gentle Kate .
How So far
Well , that is the dowry of his wife ’tis none of his own getting . Horns Even so . Poor men alone No , no . The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal . Is the single man therefore blessed No . As a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor . And by how much defense is better than no skill , by so much is a horn more precious than to want .
Here comes Sir Oliver . Sir Oliver Martext , you are well met . Will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel
Is there none here to give the woman
I will not take her on gift of any man .
Truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
Proceed , proceed . I’ll give her .
Good even , good Monsieur What ye call’t . How do you , sir You are very well met . God ild you for your last company . I am very glad to see you . Even a toy in hand here , sir . Nay , pray be covered .
Will you be married , motley
That year indeed he was troubled with a rheum . What willingly he did confound he wailed , Believe ’t , till I wept too .
No , sweet Octavia , You shall hear from me still . The time shall not Outgo my thinking on you .
Come , sir , come , I’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love . Look , here I have you .
May these same instruments , which you profane , Never sound more when drums and trumpets shall I’ the field prove flatterers , let courts and cities be Made all of false faced soothing When steel grows soft as the parasite’s silk , Let him be made a coverture for the wars No more , I say For that I have not wash’d My nose that bled , or foil’d some debile wretch . Which , without note , here’s many else have done , You shout me forth In acclamations hyperbolical As if I loved my little should be dieted In praises sauced with lies .
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods .
Adieu . Be happy .
Too modest are you More cruel to your good report than grateful To us that give you truly by your patience , If ’gainst yourself you be incensed , we’ll put you , Like one that means his proper harm , in manacles , Then reason safely with you . Therefore , be it known , As to us , to all the world , that Caius Martius Wears this war’s garland in token of the which , My noble steed , known to the camp , I give him , With all his trim belonging and from this time , For what he did before Corioli , call him , With all the applause and clamour of the host , CAIUS MARTIUS CORIOLANUS Bear The addition nobly ever
Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way .
Farewell , farewell .
Farewell .
Up in the air , crowned with the golden sun , Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made . This is a stem Of that victorious stock , and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him .
Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your Majesty .
Master , there is a bark of Epidamnum That stays but till her owner comes aboard , And then , sir , she bears away . Our fraughtage , sir , I have conveyed aboard , and I have bought The oil , the balsamum and aqua vitae . The ship is in her trim the merry wind Blows fair from land . They stay for naught at all But for their owner , master , and yourself .
We’ll give them present audience . Go , and bring them .
How now A madman Why , thou peevish sheep , What ship of Epidamnum stays for me
You see this chase is hotly followed , friends .
A ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
Thou drunken slave , I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end .
Turn head and stop pursuit , for coward dogs Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten Runs far before them . Good my sovereign , Take up the English short , and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head . Self love , my liege , is not so vile a sin As self neglecting .
You sent me for a rope’s end as soon . You sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
From our brother England
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed . To Adriana , villain , hie thee straight . Give her this key , and tell her in the desk That’s cover’d o er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats . Let her send it . Tell her I am arrested in the street , And that shall bail me . Hie thee , slave . Begone . On , officer , to prison till it come .
From him , and thus he greets your Majesty He wills you , in the name of God Almighty , That you divest yourself and lay apart
As the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
And will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar Get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is . This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot . Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another , for he is not like to marry me well , and not being well married , it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife .
Go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
Come , sweet Audrey . We must be married , or we must live in bawdry . Farewell , good Master Oliver , not O sweet Oliver , O brave Oliver , Leave me not behind thee But Wind away , Begone , I say , I will not to wedding with thee .
Tis no matter . Ne er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
Not an inch further . But hark you , Kate , Whither I go , thither shall you go too . Today will I set forth , tomorrow you . Will this content you , Kate
It must , of force .
This Doll Tearsheet should be some road .
Caius Martius Coriolanus
I warrant you , as common as the way between Saint Alban’s and London .
I will go wash And when my face is fair , you shall perceive Whether I blush or no howbeit , I thank you . I mean to stride your steed , and at all times To undercrest your good addition To the fairness of my power .
How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colors , and not ourselves be seen
Never talk to me . I will weep .
Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons , and wait upon him at his table as drawers .
So , to our tent Where , ere we do repose us , we will write To Rome of our success . You , Titus Lartius , Must to Corioli back send us to Rome The best , with whom we may articulate , For their own good and ours .
Do , I prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
I shall , my lord .
From a god to a bull a heavy decension . It was Jove’s case . From a prince to a prentice a low transformation that shall be mine , for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly . Follow me , Ned .
But have I not cause to weep
The gods begin to mock me . I , that now Refused most princely gifts , am bound to beg Of my lord general .
As good cause as one would desire . Therefore weep .
Take’t ’tis yours . What is’t
His very hair is of the dissembling color .
I sometime lay here in Corioli At a poor man’s house he used me kindly He cried to me I saw him prisoner But then Aufidius was with in my view , And wrath o’erwhelm’d my pity I request you To give my poor host freedom .
Something browner than Judas’s . Marry , his kisses are Judas’s own children .
I faith , his hair is of a good color .
Where is the fellow
Half afeard to come .
Go to , go to . Come hither , sir .
Good majesty , Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased .
That Herod’s head I’ll have But how When Antony is gone , Through whom I might command it Come thou near .
Most gracious majesty
Didst thou behold Octavia
Ay , dread Queen .
Where
Madam , in Rome . I looked her in the face , and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony .
Is she as tall as me
She is not , madam .
Didst hear her speak Is she shrill tongued or low
Madam , I heard her speak . She is low voiced .
An excellent color . Your chestnut was ever the only color .
That’s not so good . He cannot like her long .
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
To Adriana . That is where we dined , Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband . She is too big , I hope , for me to compass . Thither I must , although against my will , For servants must their masters minds fulfill .
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana . A nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously . The very ice of chastity is in them .
But why did he swear he would come this morning , and comes not
O day and night , but this is wondrous strange
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome . There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , Than are dreamt of in your philosophy . But come , Here , as before , never , so help you mercy , How strange or odd soe er I bear myself , That you , at such times seeing me , never shall With arms encumbered thus , or this headshake , Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase , As Well , well , we know , or We could an if we would , Or If we list to speak , or There be an if they might , Or such ambiguous giving out to note That you know aught of me . This not to do , So grace and mercy at your most need help you , Swear .
Swear
Rest , rest , perturbèd spirit So , gentlemen , With all my love I do commend me to you , And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do , to express his love and friending to you , God willing , shall not lack . Let us go in together , And still your fingers on your lips , I pray . The time is out of joint . O cursèd spite , That ever I was born to set it right Nay , come , let’s go together .
Nay , certainly , there is no truth in him .
Do you think so
Yes , I think he is not a pick purse nor a horse stealer , but for his verity in love , I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm eaten nut .
Not true in love
Yes , when he is in , but I think he is not in .
You have heard him swear downright he was .
Was is not is . Besides , the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster . They are both the confirmer of false reckonings . He attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him . He asked me of what parentage I was . I told him , of as good as he . So he laughed and let me go . But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando
Ned , prithee , come out of that fat room and lend me thy hand to laugh a little .
Where hast been , Hal
Oh , that’s a brave man . He writes brave verses , speaks brave words , swears brave oaths , and breaks them bravely , quite traverse , athwart the heart of his lover , as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides .
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads . I have sounded the very bass string of humility . Sirrah , I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers , and can call them all by their christen names , as Tom , Dick , and Francis . They take it already upon their salvation that though I be but Prince of Wales , yet I am the king of courtesy , and tell me flatly am no proud jack , like Falstaff , but a Corinthian , a lad of mettle , a good boy by the Lord , so they call me and when I am King of England , I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap . They call drinking deep dyeing scarlet , and when you breathe in your watering , they cry Hem and bid you Play it off To conclude , I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life . I tell thee , Ned , thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action but , sweet Ned to sweeten which name of Ned , I give thee this pennyworth of sugar , clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker , one that never spake other English in his life than Eight shillings and sixpence , and You are welcome , with this shrill addition , Anon , anon , sir . Score a pint of bastard in the Half moon , or so . But , Ned , to drive away the time till Falstaff come , I prithee , do thou stand in some by room while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar and do thou never leave calling Francis , that his tale to me may be nothing but Anon . Step aside , and I’ll show thee a precedent .
O , well begg’d Were he the butcher of my son , he should Be free as is the wind . Deliver him , Titus .
Martius , his name
By Jupiter forgot . I am weary yea , my memory is tired . Have we no wine here
Go we to our tent The blood upon your visage dries ’tis time It should be look’d to come .
Ah , Luciana , did he tempt thee so Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest , yea or no Looked he or red or pale , or sad or merrily What observation mad’st thou in this case Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face
First he denied you had in him no right .
He meant he did me none the more my spite .
Then swore he that he was a stranger here .
And true he swore , though yet forsworn he were .
Then pleaded I for you .
And what said he
That love i begged for you he begged of me .
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love
With words that in an honest suit might move . First he did praise my beauty , then my speech .
Did’st speak him fair
Who comes here
Mistress and master , you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love , Who you saw sitting by me on the turf , Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress .
Well , and what of him
If you will see a pageant truly played Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain , Go hence a little , and I shall conduct you , If you will mark it .
Bring us to this sight , and you shall say I’ll prove a busy actor in their play .
The borrowed glories that , by gift of heaven , By law of nature and of nations , longs To him and to his heirs namely , the crown And all wide stretchèd honors that pertain By custom and the ordinance of times Unto the crown of France . That you may know Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim Picked from the wormholes of long vanished days , Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked , He sends you this most memorable line , In every branch truly demonstrative , Willing you overlook this pedigree , And when you find him evenly derived From his most famed of famous ancestors , Edward the Third , he bids you then resign Your crown and kingdom , indirectly held From him , the native and true challenger .
Or else what follows
Like her O Isis , ’tis impossible .
Bloody constraint , for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts , there will he rake for it . Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming , In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove , That , if requiring fail , he will compel , And bids you , in the bowels of the Lord , Deliver up the crown and to take mercy On the poor souls for whom this hungry war Opens his vasty jaws , and on your head Turning the widows tears , the orphans cries , The dead men’s blood , the pining maidens groans , For husbands , fathers , and betrothèd lovers , That shall be swallowed in this controversy . This is his claim , his threat ning , and my message Unless the Dauphin be in presence here , To whom expressly I bring greeting too .
I think so , Charmian . Dull of tongue , and dwarfish . What majesty is in her gait Remember , If e’er thou looked’st on majesty .
She creeps . Her motion and her station are as one . She shows a body rather than a life , A statue than a breather .
Is this certain
Or I have no observance .
Three in Egypt Cannot make better note .
He’s very knowing , I do perceive ’t . There’s nothing in her yet . The fellow has good judgment .
Excellent .
Guess at her years , I prithee .
Madam , she was a widow
Widow Charmian , hark .
And I do think she’s thirty .
Bear’st thou her face in mind Is ’t long or round
Round , even to faultiness .
For the most part , too , they are foolish that are so . Her hair , what color
Give him this money and these notes , Reynaldo .
I will , my lord .
You shall do marvelous wisely , good Reynaldo , Before you visit him , to make inquire Of his behavior .
My lord , I did intend it .
Marry , well said , very well said . Look you , sir , Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris , And how , and who , what means , and where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son , come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it . Take you , as ’twere , some distant knowledge of him , As thus I know his father and his friends , And , in part , him . Do you mark this , Reynaldo
Ay , very well , my lord .
And in part him , but , you may say , not well . But , if ’t be he I mean , he’s very wild . Addicted so and so . And there put on him What forgeries you please . Marry , none so rank As may dishonor him . Take heed of that . But , sir , such wanton , wild , and usual slips
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me . Do not , Phoebe . Say that you love me not , but say not so In bitterness . The common executioner , Whose heart th accustomed sight of death makes hard , Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon . Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
I would not be thy executioner . I fly thee , for I would not injure thee . Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye . Tis pretty , sure , and very probable That eyes , that are the frail’st and softest things , Who shut their coward gates on atomies , Should be called tyrants , butchers , murderers . Now I do frown on thee with all my heart , And if mine eyes can wound , now let them kill thee . Now counterfeit to swoon , why , now fall down Or if thou canst not , Oh , for shame , for shame , Lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers . Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee . Scratch thee but with a pin , and there remains Some scar of it . Lean upon a rush , The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps . But now mine eyes , Which I have darted at thee , hurt thee not . Nor , I am sure , there is no force in eyes That can do hurt .
Francis
Thou art perfect .
Francis
Anon , anon , sir . Look down into the Pomgarnet , Ralph .
Come hither , Francis .
My lord
How long hast thou to serve , Francis
Forsooth , five years , and as much as to
Francis
Anon , anon , sir .
Five year By r lady , a long lease for the clinking of pewter But , Francis , darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture , and show it a fair pair of heels , and run from it
O Lord , sir , I’ll be sworn upon all the books in England , I could find in my heart
Francis
Have patience , I beseech .
I cannot , nor I will not hold me still My tongue , though not my heart , shall have his will . He is deformèd , crooked , old , and sere , Ill faced , worse bodied , shapeless everywhere , Vicious , ungentle , foolish , blunt , unkind , Stigmatical in making , worse in mind .
Who would be jealous , then , of such a one No evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
Ah , but I think him better than I say , And yet would herein others eyes were worse . Far from her nest the lapwing cries away . My heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
I pray thee , loving wife and gentle daughter , Give even way unto my rough affairs . Put not you on the visage of the times And be , like them , to Percy troublesome .
Here , go the desk , the purse Sweet , now make haste .
I have given over . I will speak no more . Do what you will your wisdom be your guide .
How hast thou lost thy breath
Alas , sweet wife , my honor is at pawn , And , but my going , nothing can redeem it .
By running fast .
Where is thy master , Dromio Is he well
No , he’s in Tartar limbo , worse than hell . A devil in an everlasting garment hath him , One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel A fiend , a fury , pitiless and rough A wolf , nay , worse , a fellow all in buff A back friend , a shoulder clapper , one that countermands
O yet , for God’s sake , go not to these wars . The time was , father , that you broke your word , When you were more endeared to it than now , When your own Percy , when my heart’s dear Harry , Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers but he did long in vain . Who then persuaded you to stay at home There were two honors lost , yours and your son’s . For yours , the God of heaven brighten it . For his , it stuck upon him as the sun In the gray vault of heaven , and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts . He was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves . He had no legs that practiced not his gait And speaking thick , which nature made his blemish , Became the accents of the valiant For those that could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse
Brown , madam , and her forehead As low as she would wish it .
There’s gold for thee . Thou must not take my former sharpness ill . I will employ thee back again I find thee Most fit for business . Go make thee ready Our letters are prepared .
A proper man .
Indeed , he is so . I repent me much That so I harried him . Why , methinks , by him , This creature’s no such thing .
Nothing , madam .
The man hath seen some majesty and should know .
Hath he seen majesty Isis else defend , And serving you so long
I have one thing more to ask him yet , good Charmian But ’tis no matter thou shalt bring him to me Where I will write . All may be well enough .
I warrant you , madam .
As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty .
As gaming , my lord
Ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarreling , drabbing you may go so far .
My lord , that would dishonor him
Faith , no , as you may season it in the charge . You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency . That’s not my meaning . But breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty , The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind , A savageness in unreclaimèd blood , Of general assault .
But , my good lord
Wherefore should you do this
Ay , my lord . I would know that .
Marry , sir , here’s my drift You , laying these slight sullies on my son As ’twere a thing a little soiled i th working Mark you , your party in converse , him you would sound , Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty , be assured He closes with you in this consequence Good sir or so , or Friend , or Gentleman , According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country .
Nay , nay , Octavia , not only that That were excusable , that and thousands more Of semblable import but he hath waged New wars ’gainst Pompey made his will , and read it To public ear Spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not But pay me terms of honor , cold and sickly He vented them , most narrow measure lent me . When the best hint was given him , he not took ’t , Or did it from his teeth .
The town is ta’en
’Twill be deliver’d back on good condition .
Condition I would I were a Roman for I cannot , Being a Volsce , be that I am . Condition What good condition can a treaty find I’ the part that is at mercy Five times , Martius , I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me , And wouldst do so , I think , should we encounter As often as we eat . By the elements , If e’er again I meet him beard to beard , He’s mine , or I am his mine emulation Hath not that honour in’t it had for where I thought to crush him in an equal force , True sword to sword , I’ll potch at him some way Or wrath or craft may get him .
He’s the devil .
Bolder , though not so subtle . My valour’s poison’d With only suffering stain by him for him Shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary , Being naked , sick , nor fane nor Capitol , The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice , Embarquements all of fury , shall lift up Their rotten privilege and custom ’gainst My hate to Martius where I find him , were it At home , upon my brother’s guard , even there , Against the hospitable canon , would I Wash my fierce hand in’s heart . Go you to the city Learn how ’tis held and what they are that must Be hostages for Rome .
Anon , sir .
How old art thou , Francis
Let me see . About Michaelmas next , I shall be
Francis
The passages of alleys , creeks , and narrow lands A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell .
Anon , sir . Pray , stay a little , my lord .
Why , man , what is the matter
Nay , but hark you , Francis , for the sugar thou gavest me , ’twas a pennyworth , was ’t not
I do not know the matter . He is ’rested on the case .
What , is he arrested Tell me at whose suit .
O Lord , I would it had been two
I will give thee for it a thousand pound . Ask me when thou wilt , and thou shalt have it .
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well , But he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him that can I tell . Will you send him , mistress , redemption the money in his desk
Francis
Go fetch it , sister .
Anon , anon .
This I wonder at , That he , unknown to me , should be in debt . Tell me , was he arrested on a band
Anon , Francis No , Francis , but tomorrow , Francis or , Francis , o Thursday or indeed , Francis , when thou wilt . But , Francis
Not on a band , but on a stronger thing A chain , a chain . Do you not hear it ring
My lord
What , the chain
Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin , crystal button , not pated , agate ring , puke stocking , caddis garter , smooth tongue , Spanish pouch
No , no , the bell . Tis time that I were gone . It was two ere I left him , and now the clock strikes one .
The hours come back . That did I never hear .
O yes , if any hour meet a sergeant , he turns back for very fear .
O dear Phoebe , If ever as that ever may be near You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make .
But till that time Come not thou near me . And when that time comes , Afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , As till that time I shall not pity thee .
And why , I pray you Who might be your mother , That you insult , exult , and all at once , Over the wretched What though you have no beauty As , by my faith , I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed Must you be therefore proud and pitiless Why , what means this Why do you look on me I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature’s sale work . Od’s my little life , I think she means to tangle my eyes , too . No , faith , proud mistress , hope not after it . Tis not your inky brows , your black silk hair , Your bugle eyeballs , nor your cheek of cream That can entame my spirits to your worship . You foolish shepherd , wherefore do you follow her , Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman . Tis such fools as you That makes the world full of ill favored children . Tis not her glass but you that flatters her , And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her . But , mistress , know yourself . Down on your knees And thank heaven , fasting , for a good man’s love , For I must tell you friendly in your ear , Sell when you can you are not for all markets . Cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer . Foul is most foul , being foul to be a scoffer . So take her to thee , shepherd . Fare you well .
O my good lord , Believe not all , or , if you must believe , Stomach not all . A more unhappy lady , If this division chance , ne’er stood between , Praying for both parts . The good gods will mock me presently , When I shall pray O bless my lord and husband Undo that prayer by crying out as loud O bless my brother Husband win , win brother Prays and destroys the prayer no midway ’Twixt these extremes at all .
Gentle Octavia , Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it . If I lose mine honor , I lose myself better I were not yours Than yours so branchless . But , as you requested , Yourself shall go between ’s . The meantime , lady , I’ll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother . Make your soonest haste So your desires are yours .
Very good , my lord .
And then , sir , does he this , he does What was I about to say By the mass , I was about to say something . Where did I leave
At closes in the consequence , at ‘friend , ’ Or so and ‘gentleman . ’
At closes in the consequence . Ay , marry . He closes thus I know the gentleman . I saw him yesterday or t other day , Or then , or then , with such or such and , as you say , There was he gaming , there o ertook in’s rouse , There falling out at tennis , or , perchance , I saw him enter such a house of sale Videlicet a brothel , or so forth . See you now , Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth . And thus do we of wisdom and of reach , With windlasses and with assays of bias , By indirections find directions out . So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son . You have me , have you not
My lord , I have .
God be wi you . Fare you well .
Good my lord .
Observe his inclination in yourself .
I shall , my lord .
Thanks to my lord . The Jove of power make me most weak , most weak , Your reconciler Wars ’twixt you twain would be As if the world should cleave , and that slain men Should solder up the rift .
When it appears to you where this begins , Turn your displeasure that way , for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them . Provide your going Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to .
But , mistress , know yourself . Down on your knees And thank heaven , fasting , for a good man’s love , For I must tell you friendly in your ear , Sell when you can you are not for all markets . Cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer . Foul is most foul , being foul to be a scoffer . So take her to thee , shepherd . Fare you well .
To seem like him . So that in speech , in gait , In diet , in affections of delight , In military rules , humors of blood , He was the mark and glass , copy and book , That fashioned others . And him O wondrous him O miracle of men him did you leave , Second to none , unseconded by you , To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage , to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name Did seem defensible . So you left him . Never , O never , do his ghost the wrong To hold your honor more precise and nice With others than with him . Let them alone . The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong . Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers , Today might I , hanging on Hotspur’s neck , Have talked of Monmouth’s grave .
Sweet youth , I pray you chide a year together . I had rather hear you chide than this man woo .
Beshrew your heart , Fair daughter , you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights . But I must go and meet with danger there , Or it will seek me in another place And find me worse provided .
He’s fall n in love with your foulness . Why look you so upon me
Oh , fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armèd commons Have of their puissance made a little taste .
For no ill will I bear you .
If they get ground and vantage of the King , Then join you with them like a rib of steel To make strength stronger but , for all our loves , First let them try themselves . So did your son He was so suffered . So came I a widow , And never shall have length of life enough
I pray you , do not fall in love with me , For I am falser than vows made in wine . Besides , I like you not . If you will know my house , Tis at the tuft of olives , here hard by . Will you go , sister Shepherd , ply her hard . Come , sister . Shepherdess , look on him better , And be not proud . Though all the world could see , None could be so abused in sight as he . Come , to our flock .
Dead shepherd , now I find thy saw of might Who ever loved that loved not at first sight
For us , we will consider of this further . Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England .
For the Dauphin , I stand here for him . What to him from England
Scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender , doth he prize you at . Thus says my king an if your father’s Highness Do not , in grant of all demands at large , Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty , He’ll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance .
Say , if my father render fair return , It is against my will , for I desire Nothing but odds with England . To that end , As matching to his youth and vanity , I did present him with the Paris balls .
He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it , Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe . And be assured you’ll find a difference , As we his subjects have in wonder found , Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now . Now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain . That you shall read In your own losses , if he stay in France .
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
O Lord , sir , who do you mean
Why , then , your brown bastard is your only drink , for look you , Francis , your white canvas doublet will sully . In Barbary , sir , it cannot come to so much .
What , sir
Francis
Away , you rogue Dost thou not hear them call
What , stand’st thou still and hear’st such a calling Look to the guests within .
My lord , old Sir John with half a dozen more are at the door . Shall I let them in
Let them alone awhile , and then open the door .
Poins
Anon , anon , sir .
Sweet Phoebe
Ha , what sayst thou , Silvius
Sweet Phoebe , pity me .
Why , I am sorry for thee , gentle Silvius .
Wherever sorrow is , relief would be . If you do sorrow at my grief in love , By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined .
Thou hast my love . Is not that neighborly
I would have you .
Why , that were covetousness . Silvius , the time was that I hated thee , And yet it is not that I bear thee love , But since that thou canst talk of love so well , Thy company , which erst was irksome to me , I will endure , and I’ll employ thee too . But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed .
So holy and so perfect is my love , And I in such a poverty of grace , That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps . Loose now and then A scattered smile , and that I’ll live upon .
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
And let him ply his music .
Well , my lord .
Farewell .
How now , Ophelia What’s the matter
O my lord , my lord , I have been so affrighted
With what , i th name of God
My lord , as I was sewing in my closet , Lord Hamlet , with his doublet all unbraced No hat upon his head his stockings fouled , Ungartered , and down gyvèd to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosèd out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me .
Mad for thy love
My lord , I do not know . But truly , I do fear it .
What said he
He took me by the wrist and held me hard . Then goes he to the length of all his arm , And , with his other hand thus o er his brow , He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it . Long stayed he so .
How now , friend Eros
As if time were in debt . How fondly dost thou reason
There’s strange news come , sir .
What , man
Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s worth to season . Nay , he’s a thief too . Have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day If he be in debt and theft , and a sergeant in the way , Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey .
This is old . What is the success
Go , Dromio . There’s the money . Bear it straight , And bring thy master home immediately . Come , sister , I am pressed down with conceit Conceit , my comfort and my injury .
Caesar , having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey , presently denied him rivality , would not let him partake in the glory of the action , and , not resting here , accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal seizes him . So the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
Then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , And throw between them all the food thou hast , They’ll grind the one the other . Where’s Antony
He’s walking in the garden thus , and spurns The rush that lies before him cries , Fool Lepidus And threats the throat of that his officer That murdered Pompey .
Our great navy’s rigged .
For Italy and Caesar . More , Domitius My lord desires you presently . My news I might have told hereafter .
Not very well , but I have met him oft , And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of .
Think not I love him , though I ask for him . Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well But what care I for words Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear . It is a pretty youth not very pretty But sure he’s proud and yet his pride becomes him . He’ll make a proper man . The best thing in him Is his complexion and faster than his tongue Did make offense , his eye did heal it up . He is not very tall yet for his years he’s tall . His leg is but so so and yet ’tis well . There was a pretty redness in his lip , A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek ’twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask . There be some women , Silvius , had they marked him In parcels as I did , would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him . For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And , now I am remembered , scorned at me . I marvel why I answered not again . But that’s all one omittance is no quittance . I’ll write to him a very taunting letter , And thou shalt bear it . Wilt thou , Silvius
Phoebe , with all my heart .
Will not you go
I am attended at the cypress grove I pray you ’Tis south the city mills bring me word thither How the world goes , that to the pace of it I may spur on my journey .
I shall , sir .
Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay , For he is footed in this land already .
You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions . A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence .
I’ll write it straight . The matter’s in my head and in my heart . I will be bitter with him and passing short . Go with me , Silvius .
At last , a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down , He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being . That done , he lets me go , And , with his head over his shoulder turned , He seemed to find his way without his eyes , For out o doors he went without their helps , And to the last bended their light on me .
Come , go with me . I will go seek the king . This is the very ecstasy of love , Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures . I am sorry . What , have you given him any hard words of late
No , my good lord . But as you did command I did repel his fetters and denied His access to me .
That hath made him mad . I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him . I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee . But beshrew my jealousy By heaven , it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion . Come , go we to the king . This must be known , which , being kept close , might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love . Come .
’Twill be naught , But let it be . Bring me to Antony .
Come , sir .
Sirrah , Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door . Shall we be merry
I prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
As merry as crickets , my lad . But hark you , what cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer . Come , what’s the issue
I am so . I do love it better than laughing .
I am now of all humors that have showed themselves humors since the old days of Goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o clock at midnight .
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
What’s o clock , Francis
Why , ’tis good to be sad and say nothing .
Anon , anon , sir .
Why then , ’tis good to be a post .
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy , which is emulation nor the musician’s , which is fantastical nor the courtier’s , which is proud nor the soldier’s , which is ambitious nor the lawyer’s , which is politic nor the lady’s , which is nice nor the lover’s , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought . Suppose that you have seen The well appointed king at Hampton pier Embark his royalty , and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning . Play with your fancies and in them behold , Upon the hempen tackle , shipboys climbing . Hear the shrill whistle , which doth order give To sounds confused . Behold the threaden sails , Borne with th invisible and creeping wind , Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea , Breasting the lofty surge . Oh , do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th inconstant billows dancing , For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur . Follow , follow Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy And leave your England , as dead midnight still , Guarded with grandsires , babies , and old women , Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance , For who is he whose chin is but enriched With one appearing hair that will not follow These culled and choice drawn cavaliers to France Work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege . Behold the ordnance on their carriages , With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur . Suppose th Ambassador from the French comes back , Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well acquainted friend , And every one doth call me by my name . Some tender money to me some invite me Some other give me thanks for kindnesses Some offer me commodities to buy . Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me , And therewithal took measure of my body . Sure , these are but imaginary wiles , And lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
Master , here’s The gold you sent me for . What , have you got the picture of old Adam new appareled
What gold is this What Adam dost thou mean
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise , but that Adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the Prodigal he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
I understand thee not .
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot , and yet the son of a woman His industry is upstairs and downstairs , his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning . I am not yet of Percy’s mind , the Hotspur of the north , he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast , washes his hands , and says to his wife Fie upon this quiet life I want work . O my sweet Harry , says she , how many hast thou killed today Give my roan horse a drench , says he , and answers Some fourteen , an hour after . A trifle , a trifle . I prithee , call in Falstaff . I’ll play Percy , and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife . Rivo says the drunkard . Call in Ribs , call in Tallow .
Contemning Rome , he has done all this and more In Alexandria . Here’s the manner of ’t I’ th’ marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned . At the feet sat Caesarion , whom they call my father’s son , And all the unlawful issue that their lust Since then hath made between them . Unto her He gave the stablishment of Egypt , made her Of lower Syria , Cyprus , Lydia , Absolute Queen .
This in the public eye
I’ th’ common showplace , where they exercise . His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings Great Media , Parthia , and Armenia He gave to Alexander to Ptolemy he assigned Syria , Cilicia , and Phoenicia . She In th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared , and oft before gave audience , As ’tis reported , so .
Let Rome be thus informed .
Who , queasy with his insolence already , Will their good thoughts call from him .
To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven For recordation to my noble husband .
Come , come , go in with me . Tis with my mind As with the tide swelled up unto his height , That makes a still stand , running neither way . Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop , But many thousand reasons hold me back . I will resolve for Scotland . There am I Till time and vantage crave my company .
A traveler . By my faith , you have great reason to be sad . I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s . Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
Yes , I have gained my experience .
And your experience makes you sad . I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it , too .
Good day and happiness , dear Rosalind .
Nay then , God be wi you , an you talk in blank verse .
Farewell , Monsieur Traveler . Look you lisp and wear strange suits , disable all the benefits of your own country , be out of love with your nativity , and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are , or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola .
Why , how now , Orlando , where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick , never come in my sight more .
My fair Rosalind , I come within an hour of my promise .
The augurer tells me we shall have news to night .
Good or bad
Not according to the prayer of the people , for they love not Martius .
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends .
Pray you , who does the wolf love
The lamb .
Ay , to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble Martius .
He’s a lamb indeed , that baes like a bear .
He’s a bear indeed , that lives like a lamb . You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you .
Well , sir .
In what enormity is Martius poor in , that you two have not in abundance
He’s poor in no one fault , but stored with all .
Especially in pride .
And topping all others in boasting .
This is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city , I mean of us o’ the right hand file do you
The people knows it , and have now received His accusations .
Who does he accuse
Caesar , and that , having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled , we had not rated him His part o’ th’ isle . Then does he say he lent me Some shipping , unrestored . Lastly , he frets That Lepidus of the triumvirate Should be deposed , and , being , that we detain All his revenue .
Sir , this should be answered .
Katherine his daughter and with her , to dowry , Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms . The offer likes not , and the nimble gunner With linstock now the devilish cannon touches ,
’Tis done already , and the messenger gone . I have told him , Lepidus was grown too cruel , That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change . For what I have conquered , I grant him part but then , in his Armenia , And other of his conquered kingdoms , I Demand the like .
He’ll never yield to that .
Nor must not then be yielded to in this .
Break an hour’s promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love , it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o th shoulder , but I’ll warrant him heart whole .
Hail , Caesar , and my lord Hail , most dear Caesar
Pardon me , dear Rosalind .
That ever I should call thee castaway
Nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight . I had as lief be wooed of a snail .
Of a snail
Ay , of a snail , for though he comes slowly , he carries his house on his head a better jointure , I think , than you make a woman . Besides , he brings his destiny with him .
What’s that
Why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for . But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
Virtue is no hornmaker , and my Rosalind is virtuous .
And I am your Rosalind .
No Why , ’tis a plain case he that went , like a bass viol in a case of leather the man , sir , that , when gentlemen are tired , gives them a sob and ’rests them he , sir , that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris pike .
It pleases him to call you so , but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you .
What , thou meanest an officer
Ay , sir , the sergeant of the band he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band one that thinks a man always going to bed and says God give you good rest .
Well , sir , there rest in your foolery . Is there any ships put forth tonight May we be gone
Why , sir , I brought you word an hour since that the bark Expedition put forth tonight , and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy Delay . Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you .
The fellow is distract , and so am I , And here we wander in illusions . Some blessed power deliver us from hence
Well met , well met , Master Antipholus . I see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now . Is that the chain you promised me today
And down goes all before them . Still be kind And eke out our performance with your mind .
Satan , avoid I charge thee , tempt me not .
Master , is this Mistress Satan
Come , woo me , woo me , for now I am in a holiday humor , and like enough to consent . What would you say to me now , an I were your very , very Rosalind
I would kiss before I spoke .
Nay , you were better speak first , and when you were graveled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss . Very good orators , when they are out , they will spit and for lovers lacking God warn us matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
How if the kiss be denied
Then she puts you to entreaty , and there begins new matter .
Who could be out , being before his beloved mistress
Marry , that should you if I were your mistress , or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
What , of my suit
Not out of your apparel , and yet out of your suit . Am not I your Rosalind
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern . Moreover that we much did long to see you , The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending . Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s transformation so call it Since nor th exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was . What it should be , More than his father’s death , that thus hath put him So much from th understanding of himself , I cannot dream of . I entreat you both That , being of so young days brought up with him And since so neighbored to his youth and havior , That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather , So much as from occasion you may glean , Whether aught , to us unknown , afflicts him thus That , opened , lies within our remedy .
Why , how are we censured
Because you talk of pride now , will you not be angry
Good gentlemen , he hath much talked of you . And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres . If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope , Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king’s remembrance .
Well , well , sir , well .
Why , ’tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins , and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so . You blame Martius for being proud
We do it not alone , sir .
I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many , or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant like for doing much alone . You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks , and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you could
What then , sir
Why , then you should discover a brace of unmeriting , proud , violent , testy magistrates , alias fools , as any in Rome .
Menenius , you are known well enough too .
I am known to be a humorous patrician , and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in’t said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what I think I utter , and spend my malice in my breath . Meeting two such wealsmen as you are I cannot call you Lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely , I make a crooked face at it . I can’t say your worships have delivered the matter well , when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men , yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces . If you see this in the map of my microcosm , follows it that I am known well enough too what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character , if I be known well enough too
You have not called me so , nor have you cause .
Why have you stol’n upon us thus You come not Like Caesar’s sister . The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear . The trees by th’ way Should have borne men , and expectation fainted , Longing for what it had not . Nay , the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven , Raised by your populous troops . But you are come A market maid to Rome and have prevented The ostentation of our love , which , left unshown , Is often left unloved . We should have met you By sea and land , supplying every stage With an augmented greeting .
Good my lord , To come thus was I not constrained , but did it On my free will . My lord , Mark Antony , Hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted My grievèd ear withal , whereon I begged His pardon for return .
Which soon he granted , Being an obstruct ’tween his lust and him .
Welcome , Jack . Where hast thou been
A plague of all cowards , I say , and a vengeance too Marry and amen Give me a cup of sack , boy . Ere I lead this life long , I’ll sew netherstocks and mend them , and foot them too . A plague of all cowards Give me a cup of sack , rogue . Is there no virtue extant
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter Pitiful hearted Titan that melted at the sweet tale of the sun’s If thou didst , then behold that compound .
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her .
You rogue , here’s lime in this sack too . There is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man , yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it . A villanous coward Go thy ways , old Jack . Die when thou wilt . If manhood , good manhood , be not forgot upon the face of the earth , then am I a shotten herring . There lives not three good men unhanged in England , and one of them is fat and grows old , God help the while . A bad world , I say . I would I were a weaver . I could sing psalms , or anything . A plague of all cowards , I say still .
Well , in her person I say I will not have you .
How now , woolsack , what mutter you
Then , in mine own person I die .
No , faith , die by attorney . The poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicet , in a love cause . Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club , yet he did what he could to die before , and he is one of the patterns of love . Leander , he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night , for , good youth , he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and , being taken with the cramp , was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos . But these are all lies . Men have died from time to time , and worms have eaten them , but not for love .
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind , for I protest her frown might kill me .
By this hand , it will not kill a fly . But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming on disposition , and ask me what you will , I will grant it .
Then love me , Rosalind .
Yes , faith , will I , Fridays and Saturdays and all .
And wilt thou have me
Do not say so , my lord .
I have eyes upon him , And his affairs come to me on the wind . Where is he now
My lord , in Athens .
No , my most wrongèd sister . Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her . He hath given his empire Up to a whore who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war . He hath assembled Bocchus , the King of Libya Archelaus , Of Cappadocia Philadelphos , King Of Paphlagonia the Thracian king , Adallas King Manchus of Arabia King of Pont Herod of Jewry Mithridates , King Of Comagen Polemon and Amyntas , The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia , With a more larger list of scepters .
Ay me , most wretched , That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other
What the devil hast thou brought there applejohns Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an applejohn .
Mass , thou sayest true . The Prince once set a dish of applejohns before him and told him there were five more Sir Johns and , putting off his hat , said I will now take my leave of these six dry , round , old , withered knights . It angered him to the heart . But he hath forgot that .
Welcome hither . Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger . Cheer your heart . Be you not troubled with the time , which drives O’er your content these strong necessities , But let determined things to destiny Hold unbewailed their way . Welcome to Rome , Nothing more dear to me . You are abused Beyond the mark of thought , and the high gods , To do you justice , makes his ministers Of us and those that love you . Best of comfort , And ever welcome to us .
Why then , cover , and set them down , and see if thou canst find out Sneak’s noise . Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music .
Dispatch the room where they supped is too hot . They’ll come in straight .
Sirrah , here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon , and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons , and Sir John must not know of it . Bardolph hath brought word .
It is the devil .
By the Mass , here will be old utis . It will be an excellent stratagem .
Nay , she is worse she is the devil’s dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench . And thereof comes that the wenches say God damn me that’s as much to say God make me a light wench . It is written they appear to men like angels of light . Light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn ergo , light wenches will burn . Come not near her .
I’ll see if I can find out Sneak .
Your man and you are marvelous merry , sir . Will you go with me We’ll mend our dinner here .
Master , if you do , expect spoon meat or bespeak a long spoon .
Why , Dromio
Marry , he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil .
Avoid then , fiend What tell’st thou me of supping Thou art , as you are all , a sorceress . I conjure thee to leave me and be gone .
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner Or , for my diamond , the chain you promised , And I’ll be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
Ay , and twenty such .
What sayest thou
Come , sir , come , we know you well enough .
Both your majesties Might , by the sovereign power you have of us , Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty .
Are you not good
Welcome , lady .
But we both obey And here give up ourselves , in the full bent , To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded .
I hope so .
You know neither me , yourselves nor any thing . You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience . When you are hearing a matter between party and party , if you chance to be pinched with the colic , you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and , in roaring for a chamber pot , dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is , calling both the parties knaves . You are a pair of strange ones .
Thanks , Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern .
Welcome , dear madam . Each heart in Rome does love and pity you . Only th’ adulterous Antony , most large In his abominations , turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us .
Why then , can one desire too much of a good thing Come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us . Give me your hand , Orlando . What do you say , sister
Come , come , you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol .
Is it so , sir
Thanks , Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz . And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son . Go , some of you , And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is .
Pray thee , marry us .
Most certain . Sister , welcome . Pray you Be ever known to patience . My dear’st sister
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him
I cannot say the words .
Our very priests must become mockers , if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are . When you speak best unto the purpose , it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s cushion , or to be entombed in an ass’s pack saddle . Yet you must be saying , Martius is proud who in a cheap estimation , is worth predecessors since Deucalion , though peradventure some of the best of ’em were hereditary hangmen . God den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain , being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you .
Ay , amen
You must begin Will you , Orlando
Go to . Will you , Orlando , have to wife this Rosalind
Th ambassadors from Norway , my good lord , Are joyfully returned .
I will .
Thou still hast been the father of good news .
Ay , but when
Why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
Have I , my lord I assure my good liege , I hold my duty as I hold my soul , Both to my God and to my gracious king .
Then you must say I take thee , Rosalind , for wife .
I take thee , Rosalind , for wife .
Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , Or close the wall up with our English dead In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility , But when the blast of war blows in our ears , Then imitate the action of the tiger Stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood , Disguise fair nature with hard favored rage , Then lend the eye a terrible aspect , Let pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon , let the brow o erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a gallèd rock O erhang and jutty his confounded base , Swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean . Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide , Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height . On , on , you noblest English , Whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof , Fathers that , like so many Alexanders , Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument . Dishonor not your mothers . Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you . Be copy now to men of grosser blood , And teach them how to war . And you , good yeoman , Whose limbs were made in England , show us here The mettle of your pasture . Let us swear That you are worth your breeding , which I doubt not ,
I will be even with thee , doubt it not .
But why , why , why
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit .
Well , is it , is it
Is ’t not denounced against us Why should not we Be there in person
Well , I could reply , If we should serve with horse and mares together , The horse were merely lost . The mares would bear A soldier and his horse .
What is ’t you say
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony , Take from his heart , take from his brain , from ’s time What should not then be spared . He is already Traduced for levity , and ’tis said in Rome That Photinus , an eunuch , and your maids Manage this war .
Sink Rome And their tongues rot That speak against us A charge we bear i’ th’ war , And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man . Speak not against it . I will not stay behind .
I might ask you for your commission , but I do take thee , Orlando , for my husband . There’s a girl goes before the priest , and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions .
So do all thoughts . They are winged .
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
Forever and a day .
Say a day without the ever . No , no , Orlando , men are April when they woo , December when they wed . Maids are May when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives . I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey . I will weep for nothing , like Diana in the fountain , and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry . I will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
But will my Rosalind do so
By my life , she will do as I do .
Oh , but she is wise .
Nay , I have done . Here comes the Emperor .
Is it not strange , Canidius , That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne You have heard on ’t , sweet
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent .
A good rebuke , Which might have well becomed the best of men , To taunt at slackness . Canidius , we will fight With him by sea .
By sea , what else
Why will My lord do so
And I do think or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy .
For that he dares us to ’t .
Oh , speak of that . That do I long to hear .
Give first admittance to th ambassadors . My news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
So hath my lord dared him to single fight .
Thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
Ay , and to wage this battle at Pharsalia , Where Caesar fought with Pompey . But these offers , Which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , And so should you .
He tells me , my dear Gertrude , he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper .
Your ships are not well manned , Your mariners are muleteers , reapers , people Engrossed by swift impress . In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought . Their ships are yare , yours , heavy . No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea , Being prepared for land .
I doubt it is no other but the main His father’s death and our o erhasty marriage .
Well , we shall sift him . Welcome , my good friends Say , Voltemand , what from our brother Norway
Most fair return of greetings and desires . Upon our first , he sent out to suppress His nephew’s levies , which to him appeared To be a preparation gainst the Polack , But , better looked into , he truly found It was against your highness . Whereat grieved That so his sickness , age , and impotence Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests On Fortinbras , which he , in brief , obeys , Receives rebuke from Norway , and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th assay of arms against your majesty . Whereon old Norway , overcome with joy ,
A King’s son If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath , and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese , I’ll never wear hair on my face more . You , Prince of Wales
Or else she could not have the wit to do this . The wiser , the waywarder . Make the doors upon a woman’s wit , and it will out at the casement . Shut that , and ’twill out at the keyhole . Stop that , ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
Why , you whoreson round man , what’s the matter
A man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say Wit , whither wilt
Are not you a coward Answer me to that and Poins there
Nay , you might keep that check for it , till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed .
Zounds , ye fat paunch , an you call me coward , by the Lord , I’ll stab thee .
And what wit could wit have to excuse that
I call thee coward I’ll see thee damned ere I call thee coward , but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst . You are straight enough in the shoulders you care not who sees your back . Call you that backing of your friends A plague upon such backing Give me them that will face me . Give me a cup of sack . I am a rogue if I drunk today .
Marry , to say she came to seek you there . You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue . Oh , that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .
O villain , thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunk’st last .
For these two hours , Rosalind , I will leave thee .
All is one for that . A plague of all cowards , still say I .
Alas , dear love , I cannot lack thee two hours .
What’s the matter
I must attend the duke at dinner . By two o clock I will be with thee again .
What’s the matter There be four of us here have ta en a thousand pound this day morning .
Ay , go your ways , go your ways . I knew what you would prove . My friends told me as much , and I thought no less . That flattering tongue of yours won me . Tis but one cast away , and so , come , death . Two o clock is your hour
Where is it , Jack Where is it
How now , my as fair as noble ladies , and the moon , were she earthly , no nobler , whither do you follow your eyes so fast
Honourable Menenius , my boy Martius approaches for the love of Juno , let’s go .
Ha Martius coming home
Ay , worthy Menenius and with most prosperous approbation .
By sea , by sea .
Most worthy sir , you therein throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land , Distract your army , which doth most consist Of war marked footmen , leave unexecuted Your own renownèd knowledge , quite forego The way which promises assurance , and Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard From firm security .
I’ll fight at sea .
Take my cap , Jupiter , and I thank thee . Hoo Martius coming home
Nay , ’tis true .
Look , here’s a letter from him the state hath another , his wife another and , I think , there’s one at home for you .
I will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me
Some devils ask but the parings of one’s nail , a rush , a hair , a drop of blood , a pin , a nut , a cherrystone but she , more covetous , would have a chain . Master , be wise . An if you give it her , the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it .
Yes , certain , there’s a letter for you I saw’t .
I pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain . I hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
Avaunt , thou witch Come , Dromio , let us go .
A letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years’ health in which time I will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic , and , to this preservative , of no better report than a horse drench . Is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded .
Fly pride , says the peacock . Mistress , that you know .
I faith , sweetheart , methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality . Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire , and your color , I warrant you , is as red as any rose , in good truth , la . But , i faith , you have drunk too much canaries , and that’s a marvellous searching wine , and it perfumes the blood ere one can say What’s this How do you now
Better than I was . Hem .
Why , that’s well said . A good heart’s worth gold . Lo , here comes Sir John .
And was a worthy king How now , Mistress Doll
Sick of a calm , yea , good faith .
So is all her sect . An they be once in a calm , they are sick .
A pox damn you , muddy rascal . Is that all the comfort you give me
You make fat rascals , Mistress Doll .
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers , So levied as before , against the Polack , With an entreaty , herein further shown , That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise , On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down . (gives CLAUDIUS a document
It likes us well , And at our more considered time we’ll read , Answer , and think upon this business . Meantime we thank you for your well took labor . Go to your rest . At night we’ll feast together . Most welcome home
This business is well ended . My liege and madam , to expostulate What majesty should be , what duty is , Why day is day , night night , and time is time , Were nothing but to waste night , day , and time . Therefore , since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , I will be brief your noble son is mad . Mad call I it , for , to define true madness , What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad But let that go .
More matter , with less art .
Madam , I swear I use no art at all . That he is mad , ’tis true . Tis true , ’tis pity , And pity ’tis ’tis true a foolish figure , But farewell it , for I will use no art . Mad let us grant him then . And now remains
Ay , sweet Rosalind .
By my troth , and in good earnest , and so God mend me , and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous , if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour , I will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful . Therefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind . So , adieu .
Well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try . Adieu .
You have simply misused our sex in your love prate . We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
O coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love . But it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom , like the Bay of Portugal .
Or rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
Where is it Taken from us it is . A hundred upon poor four of us .
Now , out of doubt Antipholus is mad Else would he never so demean himself . A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , And for the same he promised me a chain . Both one and other he denies me now . The reason that I gather he is mad , Besides this present instance of his rage , Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance . Belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , On purpose shut the doors against his way . My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that , being lunatic , He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away . This course I fittest choose , For forty ducats is too much to lose .
For there is none of you so mean and base That hath not noble luster in your eyes . I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips , Straining upon the start . The game’s afoot . Follow your spirit , and upon this charge Cry God for Harry , England , and Saint George
What , a hundred , man
I am a rogue if I were not at half sword with a dozen of them two hours together . I have ’scaped by miracle . I am eight times thrust through the doublet , four through the hose , my buckler cut through and through , my sword hacked like a handsaw . Ecce signum I never dealt better since I was a man . All would not do . A plague of all cowards Let them speak . If they speak more or less than truth , they are villains , and the sons of darkness .
Speak , sirs , how was it
We four set upon some dozen .
Sixteen at least , my lord .
And bound them .
No , no , they were not bound .
You rogue , they were bound , every man of them , or I am a Jew else , an Ebrew Jew .
As we were sharing , some six or seven fresh men set upon us .
And unbound the rest , and then come in the other .
What , fought you with them all
I make them Gluttony and diseases make them I make them not .
If the cook help to make the gluttony , you help to make the diseases , Doll . We catch of you , Doll , we catch of you . Grant that , my poor virtue , grant that .
Yea , joy , our chains and our jewels .
Your broaches , pearls , and ouches for to serve bravely is to come halting off , you know to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely , and to surgery bravely , to venture upon the charged chambers bravely
I have sixty sails , Caesar none better .
Hang yourself , you muddy conger , hang yourself
By my troth , this is the old fashion . You two never meet but you fall to some discord . You are both , i good truth , as rheumatic as two dry toasts . You cannot one bear with another’s confirmities . What the good year One must bear , and that must be you . You are the weaker vessel , as they say , the emptier vessel .
Our overplus of shipping will we burn , And with the rest full manned , from th’ head of Actium Beat th’ approaching Caesar . But if we fail , We then can do ’t at land .
Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead There’s a whole merchant’s venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him . You have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the hold . ome , I’ll be friends with thee , Jack . Thou art going to the
Thy business
The news is true , my lord . He is descried . Caesar has taken Toryne .
Can he be there in person ’Tis impossible , Strange that his power should be . Canidius , Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , And our twelve thousand horse . We’ll to our ship . Away , my Thetis
O , no , no , no .
O , he is wounded I thank the gods for’t .
So do I too , if it be not too much brings a’ victory in his pocket the wounds become him .
On’s brows Menenius , he comes the third time home with the oaken garland .
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly
Titus Lartius writes , they fought together , but Aufidius got off .
And ’twas time for him too , I’ll warrant him that an he had stayed by him , I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in Corioli , and the gold that’s in them . Is the senate possessed of this
Good ladies , let’s go . Yes , yes , yes the senate has letters from the general , wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly
In troth , there’s wondrous things spoke of him .
Wondrous ay , I warrant you , and not without his true purchasing .
The gods grant them true
True pow , wow .
True I’ll be sworn they are true . Where is he wounded
On , on , on , on , on To the breach , to the breach
Pray thee , corporal , stay . The knocks are too hot , and , for mine own part , I have not a case of lives . The humor of it is too hot that is the very plainsong of it .
The plainsong is most just , for humors do abound . Knocks go and come . God’s vassals drop and die , And sword and shield In bloody field Doth win immortal fame .
Would I were in an alehouse in London I would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
And I . If wishes would prevail with me , My purpose should not fail with me , But thither would I hie .
As duly , But not as truly , As bird doth sing on bough .
Up to the breach , you dogs Avaunt , you cullions
Fear me not , man . I will not break away I’ll give thee , ere I leave thee , so much money , To warrant thee , as I am ’rested for . My wife is in a wayward mood today And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attached in Ephesus . I tell you , ’twill sound harshly in her ears .
Here comes my man . I think he brings the money . How now , sir Have you that I sent you for
Here’s that , I warrant you , will pay them all .
But where’s the money
Why , sir , I gave the money for the rope .
Five hundred ducats , villain , for a rope
I’ll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home
To a rope’s end , sir , and to that end am I returned .
And to that end , sir , I will welcome you .
God save your good worships Martius is coming home he has more cause to be proud . Where is he wounded
That we find out the cause of this effect , Or rather say , the cause of this defect , For this effect defective comes by cause . Thus it remains , and the remainder thus . Perpend . I have a daughter have while she is mine Who in her duty and obedience , mark , Hath given me this . Now gather and surmise . In her excellent white bosom , these , etc .
I’ the shoulder and i’ the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people , when he shall stand for his place . He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i’ the body .
Came this from Hamlet to her
One i’ the neck , and two i’ the thigh , there’s nine that I know .
Good madam , stay a while . I will be faithful . Doubt thou the stars are fire , Doubt that the sun doth move , Doubt truth to be a liar , But never doubt I love . O dear Ophelia , I am ill at these numbers . I have not art to reckon my groans , but that I love thee best , oh , most best , believe it . Adieu . Thine evermore , most dear lady , whilst this machine is to him , Hamlet . This in obedience hath my daughter shown me , And more above , hath his solicitings , As they fell out by time , by means , and place , All given to mine ear .
But how hath she received his love
What do you think of me
He had , before this last expedition , twenty five wounds upon him .
Now it’s twenty seven every gash was an enemy’s grave .
Hark the trumpets .
These are the ushers of Martius before him he carries noise , and behind him he leaves tears Death , that dark spirit , in ’s nervy arm doth lie Which , being advanced , declines , and then men die .
Know , Rome , that all alone Martius did fight Within Corioli gates where he hath won , With fame , a name to Caius Martius these In honour follows Coriolanus . Welcome to Rome , renowned Coriolanus
No , that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen , and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep I am in love . I’ll tell thee , Aliena , I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando . I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
And I’ll sleep .
Be merciful , great duke , to men of mold . Abate thy rage , abate thy manly rage , abate thy rage , great duke . Good bawcock , bate thy rage . Use lenity , sweet chuck .
How now , worthy soldier
These be good humors . Your Honor wins bad humors .
O noble Emperor , do not fight by sea Trust not to rotten planks . Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a ducking . We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot .
Well , well , away .
As young as I am , I have observed these three swashers . I am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me . For indeed three such antics do not amount to a man for Bardolph , he is white livered and red faced , by the means whereof he faces it out but fights not for Pistol , he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword , by the means whereof he breaks words and keeps whole weapons for Nym , he hath heard that men of few words are the best men , and therefore he scorns to say his prayers , lest he should be thought a coward , but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds , for he never broke any man’s head but his own , and that was against a post when he was drunk . They will steal anything and call it purchase . Bardolph stole a lute case , bore it twelve leagues , and sold it for three halfpence . Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching , and in Calais they stole a fire shovel . I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals . They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers , which makes much against my manhood , if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs . I must leave them and seek some better service . Their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up .
By Hercules , I think I am i’ th’ right .
Soldier , thou art but his whole action grows Not in the power on ’t . So our leader’s led , And we are women’s men .
wars , and whether I shall ever see thee again or no , there is nobody cares .
Sir , Ancient Pistol’s below and would speak with you .
Hang him , swaggering rascal Let him not come hither . It is the foul mouthed’st rogue in England .
If he swagger , let him not come here . No , by my faith , I must live among my neighbors . I’ll no swaggerers I am in good name and fame with the very best . Shut the door . There comes no swaggerers here . I have not lived all this while to have swaggering now . Shut the door , I pray you .
Dost thou hear , hostess
Pray you pacify yourself , Sir John . There comes no swaggerers here .
Dost thou hear It is mine ancient .
Tilly vally , Sir John , ne er tell me . And your ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors . I was before Master Tisick , the debuty t other day , and , as he said to me ’twas no longer ago than Wednesday last , i good faith Neighbour Quickly , says he Master Dumb , our minister , was by then Neighbour Quickly , says he , receive those that are civil , for , said he , you are in an ill name . Now he said so , I can tell whereupon . For , says he , you are an honest woman , and well thought on . Therefore take heed what guests you receive . Receive , says he , no swaggering
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole , do you not
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius , are for sea But we keep whole by land . This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief .
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies .
Welcome to Rome , renowned Coriolanus
No more of this it does offend my heart Pray now , no more .
Look , sir , your mother
O , You have , I know , petition’d all the gods For my prosperity
Nay , my good soldier , up My gentle Martius , worthy Caius , and By deed achieving honour newly named , What is it Coriolanus must I call thee But O , thy wife
My gracious silence , hail Wouldst thou have laugh’d had I come coffin’d home , That weep’st to see me triumph Ay , my dear , Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear , And mothers that lack sons .
Now , the gods crown thee
And live you yet O my sweet lady , pardon .
I know not where to turn O , welcome home And welcome , general and ye’re welcome all .
As of a man faithful and honorable .
I would fain prove so . But what might you think , When I had seen this hot love on the wing As I perceived it , I must tell you that , Before my daughter told me what might you , Or my dear majesty your queen here , think , If I had played the desk or table book , Or given my heart a winking , mute and dumb , Or looked upon this love with idle sight What might you think No , I went round to work , And my young mistress thus I did bespeak Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star . This must not be . And then I prescripts gave her , That she should lock herself from his resort , Admit no messengers , receive no tokens . Which done , she took the fruits of my advice And he , repelled a short tale to make Fell into a sadness , then into a fast , Thence to a watch , thence into a weakness , Thence to a lightness , and , by this declension , Into the madness wherein now he raves And all we mourn for .
Do you think ’tis this
It may be , very like .
Hath there been such a time I would fain know that That I have positively said , Tis so , When it proved otherwise
Not that I know .
Which is he that killed the deer
Sir , it was I .
Let’s present him to the duke like a Roman conqueror . And it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of victory . Have you no song , forester , for this purpose
Yes , sir .
Sing it . Tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn . It was a crest ere thou wast born . Thy father’s father wore it , And thy father bore it . The horn , the horn , the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn .
Who’s his lieutenant , hear you
They say , one Taurus .
Well I know the man .
The Emperor calls Canidius .
With news the time’s with labor , and throws forth Each minute some .
All I know not what you call all , but if I fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish . If there were not two or hree and fifty upon poor old Jack , then am I no two legged creature .
Pray God you have not murdered some of them .
Nay , that’s past praying for . I have peppered two of them . Two I am sure I have paid , two rogues in buckram suits . I tell thee what , Hal , if I tell thee a lie , spit in my face , call me horse . Thou knowest my old ward . Here I lay , and thus I bore my point . Four rogues in buckram let drive at me .
What , four Thou saidst but two even now .
Four , Hal , I told thee four .
Ay , ay , he said four .
These four came all afront , and mainly thrust at me . I made me no more ado , but took all their seven points in my target , thus .
Seven Why there were but four even now .
In buckram
Ay , four in buckram suits .
Captain Fluellen , you must come presently to the mines the duke of Gloucester would speak with you .
Seven , by these hilts , or I am a villain else .
Prithee , let him alone . We shall have more anon .
companions . There comes none here . You would bless you to hear what he said . No , I’ll no swaggerers .
He’s no swaggerer , hostess , a tame cheater , i faith . You may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound . He’ll not swagger with a Barbary hen if her feathers turn back in any show of resistance . Call him up , drawer .
Cheater , call you him I will bar no honest man my house , nor no cheater , but I do not love swaggering . By my troth , I am the worse when one says swagger . Feel , masters , how I shake look you , I warrant you .
So you do , hostess .
Do I Yea , in very truth , do I , an ’twere an aspen leaf . I cannot abide swaggerers .
God save you , Sir John .
Welcome , Ancient Pistol . Here , Pistol , I charge you with a cup of sack . Do you discharge upon mine hostess .
How say you now Is it not past two o clock And here much Orlando .
I warrant you , with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep .
Taurus
My lord
Strike not by land keep whole . Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea . Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll .
Our fortune lies Upon this jump .
A hundred thousand welcomes . I could weep And I could laugh , I am light and heavy . Welcome . A curse begin at very root on’s heart , That is not glad to see thee You are three That Rome should dote on yet , by the faith of men , We have some old crab trees here at home that will not Be grafted to your relish . Yet welcome , warriors We call a nettle but a nettle and The faults of fools but folly .
Ever right .
Menenius ever , ever .
Give way there , and go on
Your hand , and yours Ere in our own house I do shade my head , The good patricians must be visited From whom I have received not only greetings , But with them change of honours .
I have lived To see inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy only There’s one thing wanting , which I doubt not but Our Rome will cast upon thee .
Good sir , be patient .
Nay , ’tis for me to be patient . I am in adversity .
Good now , hold thy tongue .
Nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
Thou whoreson , senseless villain .
I would I were senseless , sir , that I might not feel your blows .
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
I am an ass , indeed you may prove it by my long ears . I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows . When I am cold , he heats me with beating when I am warm , he cools me with beating . I am waked with it when I sleep , raised with it when I sit , driven out of doors with it when I go from home , welcomed home with it when I return . Nay , I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat , and I think when he hath lamed me , I shall beg with it from door to door .
Come , go along . My wife is coming yonder .
Take this from this if this be otherwise . If circumstances lead me , I will find Where truth is hid , though it were hid indeed Within the center .
How may we try it further
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby .
So he does indeed .
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him . Be you and I behind an arras then , Mark the encounter . If he love her not And be not from his reason fall n thereon , Let me be no assistant for a state But keep a farm and carters .
We will try it .
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading .
Away , I do beseech you , both away . I’ll board him presently . O , give me leave .
How does my good Lord Hamlet
Well , God a mercy .
Do you know me , my lord
Dost thou hear me , Hal
Ay , and mark thee too , Jack .
To the mines Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines , for , look you , the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war . The concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , th athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines . By Cheshu , I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions .
I will discharge upon her , Sir John , with two bullets .
She is pistol proof . Sir , you shall not hardly offend her .
The duke of Gloucester , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman , i faith .
It is Captain Macmorris , is it not
Come , I’ll drink no proofs nor no bullets . I’ll drink no more than will do me good , for no man’s pleasure , I .
I think it be .
Then to you , Mistress Dorothy I will charge you .
Do so , for it is worth the listening to . These nine in buckram that I told thee of
By Cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world . I will verify as much in his beard . He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the Roman disciplines , than is a puppy dog .
So , two more already .
Charge me I scorn you , scurvy companion . What , you poor , base , rascally , cheating lack linen mate Away , you mouldy rogue , away I am meat for your master .
Their points being broken
I know you , Mistress Dorothy .
Here he comes , and the Scots captain , Captain Jamy , with him .
Down fell their hose .
Away , you cutpurse rascal , you filthy bung , away By this wine , I’ll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me . Away , you bottle ale rascal , you basket hilt stale juggler , you . Since when , I pray you , sir God’s light , with two points on your shoulder Much
Began to give me ground , but I followed me close , came in foot and hand , and with a thought , seven of the eleven I paid .
God let me not live , but I will murder your ruff for this .
O monstrous Eleven buckram men grown out of two
No more , Pistol . I would not have you go off here . Discharge yourself of our company , Pistol .
But as the devil would have it , three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back , and let drive at me , for it was so dark , Hal , that thou couldst not see thy hand .
No , good Captain Pistol , not here , sweet captain .
These lies are like their father that begets them , gross as a mountain , open , palpable . Why , thou claybrained guts , thou knotty pated fool , thou whoreson , obscene , greasy tallow catch
Captain Thou abominable damned cheater , art thou not ashamed to be called captain An captains were of my mind , they would truncheon you out for taking their names upon you before you have earned them . You a captain You slave ,
What , art thou mad Art thou mad Is not the truth the truth
Look who comes here .

Know , good mother , I had rather be their servant in my way , Than sway with them in theirs .
On , to the Capitol
Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer . Bear this , bear all . She says I am not fair , that I lack manners . She calls me proud , and that she could not love me Were man as rare as phoenix . Od’s my will , Her love is not the hare that I do hunt . Why writes she so to me Well , shepherd , well , This is a letter of your own device .
No , I protest , I know not the contents . Phoebe did write it .
All tongues speak of him , and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him the kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck , Clambering the walls to eye him stalls , bulks , windows , Are smother’d up , leads fill’d , and ridges horsed With variable complexions , all agreeing In earnestness to see him seld shown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station or veil’d dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicely gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil Of Phoebus’ burning kisses such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slily crept into his human powers And gave him graceful posture .
On the sudden , I warrant him consul .
Why , how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green , when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand Come , tell us your reason . What sayest thou to this
Set we our squadrons on yond side o’ th’ hill , In eye of Caesar’s battle , from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly .
Come , your reason , Jack , your reason .
What , upon compulsion Zounds , an I were at the strappado or all the racks in the world , I would not tell you on compulsion . Give you a reason on compulsion If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries , I would give no man a reason upon compulsion , I .
I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin . This sanguine coward , this bed presser , this horseback breaker , this huge hill of flesh
Sblood , you starveling , you elfskin , you dried neat’s tongue , you bull’s pizzle , you stockfish O , for breath to utter what is like thee You tailor’s yard , you sheath , you bowcase , you vile standing tuck
Well , breathe awhile , and then to it again , and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons , hear me speak but this .
Mark , Jack .
for what For tearing a poor whore’s ruff in a bawdy house He a captain Hang him , rogue . He lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes . A captain God’s light , these villains will make the word as odious as the word occupy , which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted . Therefore captains had need look to ’t .
Then our office may , During his power , go sleep .
Pray thee go down , good ancient .
We two saw you four set on four , and bound them and were masters of their wealth . Mark now how a plain tale shall put you down . Then did we two set on you four and , with a word , outfaced you from your prize , and have it yea , and can show it you here in the house . And , Falstaff , you carried your guts away as nimbly , with as quick dexterity , and roared for mercy , and still run and roared , as ever I heard bull calf . What a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou hast done , and then say it was in fight What trick , what device , what starting hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame
He cannot temperately transport his honours From where he should begin and end , but will Lose those he hath won .
Hark thee hither , Mistress Doll .
In that there’s comfort .
Not I . I tell thee what , Corporal Bardolph , I could tear her . I’ll be revenged of her .
Doubt not The commoners , for whom we stand , but they Upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honours , which That he will give them make I as little question As he is proud to do’t .
Pray thee go down .
I heard him swear , Were he to stand for consul , never would he Appear i’ the market place nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing , as the manner is , his wounds To the people , beg their stinking breaths .
I’ll see her damned first to Pluto’s damnèd lake , by this hand , to th infernal deep with Erebus and tortures vile also . Hold hook and line , say I . Down , down , dogs Down , Fates Have we not Hiren here
’Tis right .
Good Captain Peesell , be quiet . Tis very late , i faith . I beseek you now , aggravate your choler .
It was his word O , he would miss it rather Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him , And the desire of the nobles .
These be good humors indeed . Shall pack horses And hollow pampered jades of Asia , which cannot go but thirty mile a day , Compare with Caesars and with cannibals , and Troyant Greeks Nay , rather damn them with King Cerberus , and let the welkin roar . Shall we fall foul for toys
I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution .
Mistress , respice finem , respect your end , or rather , the prophecy like the parrot , Beware the rope’s end .
Excellent well . You are a fishmonger .
Wilt thou still talk
Not I , my lord .
How say you now Is not your husband mad
Then I would you were so honest a man .
His incivility confirms no less . Good Doctor Pinch , you are a conjurer Establish him in his true sense again , And I will please you what you will demand .
Honest , my lord
Alas , how fiery and how sharp he looks
Ay , sir . To be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy .
That’s very true , my lord .
Give me your hand , and let me feel your pulse .
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion Have you a daughter
I have , my lord .
There is my hand , and let it feel your ear .
I charge thee , Satan , housed within this man , To yield possession to my holy prayers And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight . I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven .
Peace , doting wizard , peace . I am not mad .
O , that thou wert not , poor distressèd soul
Let her not walk i th sun . Conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive Friend , look to ’t .
You minion , you , are these your customers Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house
What do you read , my lord
Words , words , words .
What is the matter , my lord
Between who
Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman , that is certain , and of great expedition and knowledge in th aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions . By Cheshu , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans .
I say gudday , Captain Fluellen .
Godden to your Worship , good Captain James .
How now , Captain Macmorris , have you quit the mines Have the pioneers given o er
By Chrish , la , ’tish ill done . The work ish give over . The trompet sound the retreat . By my hand I swear , and my father’s soul , the work ish ill done . It ish give over . I would have blowed up the town , so Chrish save me , la , in an hour . Oh , ’tish ill done , ’tish ill done , by my hand , ’tish ill done .
Captain Macmorris , I beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the Roman wars In the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .
It sall be vary gud , gud feith , gud captens bath , and I sall quit you with gud leve , as I may pick occasion , that sall I , marry .
Come , let’s hear , Jack . What trick hast thou now
By the Lord , I knew you as well as he that made you . Why , hear you , my masters , was it for me to kill the heir apparent Should I turn upon the true Prince Why , thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules , but beware instinct . The lion will not touch the true Prince . Instinct is a great matter . I was now a coward on instinct . I shall think the better of myself , and thee , during my life I for a valiant lion , and thou for a true Prince . But , by the Lord , lads , I am glad you have the money . Hostess , clap to the doors . Watch tonight , pray to morrow . Gallants , lads , boys , hearts of gold , all the titles of good fellowship come to you . What , shall we be merry hall we have a play extempore
Content , and the argument shall be thy running away .
Ah , no more of that , Hal , an thou lovest me .
O Jesu , my lord the Prince
How now , my lady the hostess , what sayest thou to me
By my troth , captain , these are very bitter words .
’Tis most like he will .
Begone , good ancient . This will grow to a brawl anon .
It shall be to him then as our good wills , A sure destruction .
Die men like dogs Give crowns like pins Have we not Hiren here
So it must fall out To him or our authorities . For an end , We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that to’s power he would Have made them mules , silenced their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms , holding them , In human action and capacity , Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in the war , who have their provand Only for bearing burdens , and sore blows For sinking under them .
O my word , captain , there’s none such here . What the good year , do you think I would deny her For God’s sake , be quiet .
Then feed and be fat , my fair Calipolis . Come , give ’s some sack . Si fortune me tormente , sperato me contento . Fear we broadsides No , let the fiend give fire . Give me some sack , and , sweetheart , lie thou there . Come we to full points here And are etceteras nothing
This , as you say , suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the people which time shall not want , If he be put upon ’t and that’s as easy As to set dogs on sheep will be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever .
Pistol , I would be quiet .
What’s the matter
Sweet knight , I kiss thy neaf . What , we have seen the seven stars .
For God’s sake , thrust him downstairs . I cannot endure such a fustian rascal .
Thrust him downstairs Know we not Galloway nags
Quoit him down , Bardolph , like a shove groat shilling . Nay , an he do nothing but speak nothing , he shall be nothing here .
Come , come , you are a fool , And turned into the extremity of love . I saw her hand . She has a leathern hand , A freestone colored hand . I verily did think That her old gloves were on , but ’twas her hands . She has a huswife’s hand but that’s no matter . I say she never did invent this letter . This is a man’s invention , and his hand .
Sure it is hers .
Why , ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style , A style for challengers . Why , she defies me Like Turk to Christian . Women’s gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant rude invention , Such Ethiop words , blacker in their effect Than in their countenance . Will you hear the letter
So please you , for I never heard it yet , Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty .
She Phoebes me . Mark how the tyrant writes . Art thou god to shepherd turned , That a maiden’s heart hath burned Can a woman rail thus
Call you this railing
Why , thy godhead laid apart , Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart Did you ever hear such railing Whiles the eye of man did woo me , That could do no vengeance to me . Meaning me a beast .
It is no time to discourse , so Chrish save me . The day is hot , and the weather , and the wars , and the king , and the dukes . It is no time to discourse . The town is beseeched , and the trumpet call us to the breach , and we talk and , be Chrish , do nothing , ’tis shame for us all . So God sa me , ’tis shame to stand still . It is shame , by my hand . And there is throats to be cut and works to be done , and there ish nothing done , so Chrish sa me , la .
By the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay’ll de gud service , or I’ll lig i th grund for it , ay , or go to death . And I’ll pay ’t as valorously as I may , that sall I suerly do , that is the breff and the long . Marry , I wad full fain heard some question ’tween you tway .
Captain Macmorris , I think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation
Marry , my lord , there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you . He says he comes from your father .
Of my nation What ish my nation Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal . What ish my nation Who talks of my nation
Give him as much as will make him a royal man and send him back again to my mother .
Look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , Captain Macmorris , peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as , in discretion , you ought to use me , look you , being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities .
What manner of man is he
An old man .
I do not know you so good a man as myself . So Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .
What doth Gravity out of his bed at midnight Shall I give him his answer
Gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
Prithee do , Jack .
Faith , and I’ll send him packing .
Now , sirs . By r lady , you fought fair . So did you , Peto . So did you , Bardolph . You are lions too . You ran away upon instinct . You will not touch the true Prince . No , fie
Faith , I ran when I saw others run .
O husband , God doth know you dined at home , Where would you had remained until this time , Free from these slanders and this open shame .
Faith , tell me now in earnest , how came Falstaff’s sword so hacked
Why , he hacked it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in fight , and persuaded us to do the like .
Dined at home Thou villain , what sayest thou
Yea , and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them bleed , and then to beslubber our garments with it , and swear it was the blood of true men . I did that I did not this seven year before I blushed to hear his monstrous devices .
Sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out
Perdie , your doors were locked , and you shut out .
You are sent for to the Capitol . ’Tis thought That Martius shall be consul I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and The blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves , Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers , Upon him as he pass’d the nobles bended , As to Jove’s statue , and the commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like .
Let’s to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for the time , But hearts for the event .
Have with you .
And did not she herself revile me there
Sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
Did not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me
Certes , she did the kitchen vestal scorned you .
Come , get you downstairs .
And did not I in rage depart from thence
What shall we have incision Shall we imbrue Then death rock me asleep , abridge my doleful days . Why then , let grievous , ghastly , gaping wounds untwine the Sisters Three . Come , Atropos , I say .
In verity you did . My bones bear witness , That since have felt the vigour of his rage .
Here’s goodly stuff toward
Is’t good to soothe him in these contraries
Give me my rapier , boy .
I pray thee , Jack , I pray thee do not draw .
Get you downstairs .
Here’s a goodly tumult . I’ll forswear keeping house afore I’ll be in these tirrits and frights . So , murder , I warrant now . Alas , alas , put up your naked weapons , put up your naked weapons .
It is no shame . The fellow finds his vein And , yielding to him , humors well his frenzy .
I pray thee , Jack , be quiet . The rascal’s gone . Ah , you whoreson little valiant villain , you .
Are you not hurt i the groin Methought he made a shrewd thrust at your belly .
Naught , naught , all naught I can behold no longer . Th’ Antoniad , the Egyptian admiral , With all their sixty , fly and turn the rudder . To see ’t mine eyes are blasted .
Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me .
Have you turned him out o doors
Gods and goddesses , All the whole synod of them
What’s thy passion
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance . We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces .
How appears the fight
On our side like the tokened pestilence , Where death is sure . Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt Whom leprosy o’ertake i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight , When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same , or rather ours the elder , The breeze upon her , like a cow in June , Hoists sails and flies .
That I beheld . Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view .
If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine , Alack , in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect Whiles you chid me , I did love . How then might your prayers move He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me , And by him seal up thy mind Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me , and all that I can make , Or else by him my love deny , And then I’ll study how to die .
Call you this chiding
Alas , poor shepherd .
Do you pity him No , he deserves no pity . Wilt thou love such a woman What , to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee Not to be endured . Well , go your way to her , for I see love hath made thee a tame snake , and say this to her that if she love me , I charge her to love thee if she will not , I will never have her unless thou entreat for her . If you be a true lover , hence and not a word , for here comes more company .
Good morrow , fair ones . Pray you , if you know , Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees
Ah , that’s a foul fault .
The town sounds a parley .
I mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
Captain Macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .
Slanders , sir . For the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards , that their faces are wrinkled , their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum , and that they have a plentiful lack of wit , together with most weak hams all which , sir , though I most powerfully and potently believe , yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself , sir , should be old as I am , if like a crab you could go backward .
Will you walk out of the air , my lord
Into my grave .
Indeed , that is out of the air . My honorable lord , I will most humbly take my leave of you .
You cannot , sir , take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal except my life , except my life , except my life .
Fare you well , my lord .
These tedious old fools
O villain , thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago , and wert taken with the manner , and ever since thou hast blushed extempore . Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side , and yet thou ran’st away . What instinct hadst thou for it
My lord , do you see these meteors Do you behold these exhalations
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet . There he is .
I do .
What think you they portend
Hot livers and cold purses .
Choler , my lord , if rightly taken .
No , if rightly taken , halter .
Here comes lean Jack . Here comes bare bone . How now , my sweet creature of bombast How long is ’t ago , Jack , since thou sawest thine own knee
Come , come , they are almost here . How many stand for consulships
My own knee When I was about thy years , Hal , I was not an eagle’s talon in the waist . I could have crept into any alderman’s thumb ring . A plague of sighing and grief It blows a man up like a bladder . There’s villanous news abroad . Here was Sir John Bracy from your father . You must to the court in the morning . That same mad fellow of the north , Percy , and he of Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado , and made Lucifer cuckold , and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook what a plague call you him
Three , they say but ’tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it .
That’s a brave fellow but he’s vengeance proud , and loves not the common people .
Faith , there had been many great men that have flattered the people , who ne’er loved them and there be many that they have loved , they know not wherefore so that , if they love they know not why , they hate upon no better a ground therefore , for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see’t .
If he did not care whether he had their love or no , he waved indifferently ’twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite . Now , to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes , to flatter them for their love .
Yea , sir . The rascal’s drunk . You have hurt him , sir , i the shoulder .
A rascal to brave me
Ah , you sweet little rogue , you . Alas , poor ape , how thou sweat’st Come , let me wipe thy face . Come on , you whoreson chops . Ah , rogue , i faith , I love thee . Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy , worth five of Agamemnon , and ten times better than the Nine Worthies . Ah , villain
Ah , rascally slave I will toss the rogue in a blanket .
Do , an thou darest for thy heart . An thou dost , I’ll canvass thee between a pair of sheets .
The music is come , sir .
Let them play . Play , sirs . Sit on my knee , Doll . A rascal bragging slave The rogue fled from me like quicksilver .
I faith , and thou followed’st him like a church . Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar pig , when wilt thou leave fighting a days and foining a nights and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven
West of this place , down in the neighbor bottom , The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place . But at this hour the house doth keep itself . There’s none within .
She once being loofed , The noble ruin of her magic , Antony , Claps on his sea wing and , like a doting mallard Leaving the fight in height , flies after her . I never saw an action of such shame . Experience , manhood , honor , ne’er before Did violate so itself .
Alack , alack
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably . Had our general Been what he knew himself , it had gone well . Oh , he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own
Ay , are you thereabouts Why then , good night indeed .
If that an eye may profit by a tongue , Then should I know you by description . Such garments , and such years . The boy is fair , Of female favor , and bestows himself Like a ripe sister the woman low And browner than her brother . Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for
It is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled .
Orlando doth commend him to you both , And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin . Are you he
’Tis easy to ’t , and there I will attend What further comes .
How yet resolves the governor of the town This is the latest parle we will admit . Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or , like to men proud of destruction , Defy us to our worst . For , as I am a soldier , A name that in my thoughts becomes me best , If I begin the batt ry once again , I will not leave the half achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd . The gates of mercy shall be all shut up , And the fleshed soldier , rough and hard of heart , In liberty of bloody hand , shall range With conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow ring infants . What is it then to me if impious war , Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends , Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats Enlinked to waste and desolation What is ’t to me , when you yourselves are cause , If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore . Therefore , you men of Harfleur , Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command , Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
I am . What must we understand by this
Some of my shame , if you will know of me What man I am , and how , and why , and where This handkercher was stained .
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse . Six kings already Show me the way of yielding .
I pray you , tell it .
Owen Glendower .
Owen , Owen , the same , and his son in law Mortimer , and old Northumberland , and that sprightly Scot of Scots , Douglas , that runs a horseback up a hill perpendicular
He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who , having been supple and courteous to the people , bonneted , without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes , and his actions in their hearts , that for their tongues to be silent , and not confess so much , were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise , were a malice , that , giving itself the lie , would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it .
He that rides at high speed , and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying .
No more of him he is a worthy man make way , they are coming .
You have hit it .
So did he never the sparrow .
Well , that rascal hath good mettle in him . He will not run .
Having determined of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius , it remains , As the main point of this our after meeting , To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country therefore , please you , Most reverend and grave elders , to desire The present consul , and last general In our well found successes , to report A little of that worthy work perform’d By Caius Martius Coriolanus , whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself .
Why , what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for running
A horseback , you cuckoo , but afoot he will not budge a foot .
Yes , Jack , upon instinct .
I grant you , upon instinct . Well , he is there too , and one Mordake , and a thousand blue caps more Worcester is stolen away tonight . Thy father’s beard is turned white with the news . You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel .
God save you , sir
Peace , good Doll . Do not speak like a death’s head do not bid me remember mine end .
Sirrah , what humor’s the Prince of
My honored lord
A good shallow young fellow , he would have made a good pantler he would a chipped bread well .
My most dear lord
They say Poins has a good wit .
My excellent good friends How dost thou , Guildenstern Ah , Rosencrantz Good lads , how do you both
He a good wit Hang him , baboon . His wit’s as thick as Tewksbury mustard . There’s no more conceit in him than is in a mallet .
Speak , good Cominius Leave nothing out for length , and make us think Rather our state’s defective for requital Than we to stretch it out . Masters o’ the people , We do request your kindest ears , and after , Your loving motion toward the common body , To yield what passes here .
Why does the Prince love him so then
We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty , and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly .
Which the rather We shall be blest to do , if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at .
Because their legs are both of a bigness , and he plays at quoits well , and eats conger and fennel , and drinks off candles ends for flap dragons , and rides the wild mare with the boys , and jumps upon joint stools , and swears with a good grace , and wears his boots very smooth , like unto the sign of the Leg , and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories , and such other gambol faculties he has that show a weak mind and an able body , for the which the Prince admits him for the Prince himself is such another . The weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois .
That’s off , that’s off I would you rather had been silent . Please you To hear Cominius speak
O erblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder , spoil , and villainy . If not , why , in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters , Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls , Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused Do break the clouds , as did the wives of Jewry At Herod’s bloody hunting slaughtermen . What say you Will you yield and this avoid Or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed
Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it .
Our expectation hath this day an end . The Dauphin , whom of succors we entreated , Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege . Therefore , great King , We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy . Enter our gates , dispose of us and ours , For we no longer are defensible .
Open your gates .
Come , uncle Exeter , Go you and enter Harfleur . There remain And fortify it strongly gainst the French . Use mercy to them all for us , dear uncle , The winter coming on and sickness growing Upon our soldiers , we will retire to Calais . Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest Tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
When last the young Orlando parted from you , He left a promise to return again Within an hour , and pacing through the forest , Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy , Lo , what befell . He threw his eye aside And mark what object did present itself Under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity , A wretched , ragged man , o ergrown with hair , Lay sleeping on his back . About his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself , Who with her head , nimble in threats , approached The opening of his mouth . But suddenly , Seeing Orlando , it unlinked itself And , with indented glides , did slip away Into a bush , under which bush’s shade A lioness , with udders all drawn dry , Lay couching , head on ground , with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir for ’tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead . This seen , Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother , his elder brother .
Oh , I have heard him speak of that same brother , And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men .
And well he might so do , For well I know he was unnatural .
I’ll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony , though my reason Sits in the wind against me .
But to Orlando did he leave him there , Food to the sucked and hungry lioness
Why , then , it is like if there come a hot June , and this civil buffeting hold , we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hob nails , by the hundreds .
By the Mass , thou sayest true . It is like we shall have good trading that way . But tell me , Hal , art not thou horrible afeard Thou being heir apparent , could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas , that spirit Percy , and that devil Glendower Art thou not horribly afraid Doth not thy blood thrill at it
Not a whit , i faith I lack some of thy instinct .
Well , thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father . If thou love me , practice an answer .
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life .
Shall I Conten . This chair shall be my state , this dagger my scepter , and this cushion my crown .
Thy state is taken for a joined stool , thy golden scepter for a leaden dagger , and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown .
Well , an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee , now shalt thou be moved . Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red , that it may be thought I have wept , for I must speak in passion , and I will do it in King Cambyses vein .
Well , here is my leg .
As the indifferent children of the earth .
Happy , in that we are not overhappy . On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button .
Nor the soles of her shoes
Neither , my lord .
Then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors
Faith , her privates we .
In the secret parts of Fortune Oh , most true . She is a strumpet . What news
None , my lord , but that the world’s grown honest .
Then is doomsday near . But your news is not true . Let me question more in particular . What have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither
Alas , I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here , who came in haste for it .
Money by me heart and goodwill you might , But surely , master , not a rag of money .
Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats
He came to me , and I delivered it .
And I am witness with her that she did .
God and the rope maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope .
Mistress , both man and master is possessed . I know it by their pale and deadly looks . They must be bound and laid in some dark room .
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold
I did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
And , gentle master , I received no gold . But I confess , sir , that we were locked out .
Dissembling villain , thou speak’st false in both .
Dissembling harlot , thou art false in all , And art confederate with a damnèd pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me . But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes That would behold in me this shameful sport .
He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow . Worthy Cominius , speak .
Nay , keep your place .
Hark . The land bids me tread no more upon ’t . It is ashamed to bear me . Friends , come hither . I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever . I have a ship Laden with gold . Take that , divide it . Fly And make your peace with Caesar .
Sit , Coriolanus never shame to hear What you have nobly done .
Fly Not we .
Your horror’s pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them .
Sir , I hope My words disbench’d you not .
I have fled myself , and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders . Friends , begone . I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you . Begone . My treasure’s in the harbor . Take it . Oh , I followed that I blush to look upon My very hairs do mutiny , for the white Reprove the brown for rashness , and they them For fear and doting . Friends , begone . You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you . Pray you , look not sad , Nor make replies of loathness . Take the hint Which my despair proclaims . Let that be left Which leaves itself . To the seaside straightway I will possess you of that ship and treasure . Leave me , I pray , a little . Pray you now , Nay , do so , for indeed I have lost command . Therefore I pray you . I’ll see you by and by .
No , sir yet oft , When blows have made me stay , I fled from words . You soothed not , therefore hurt not but your people , I love them as they weigh .
Pray now , sit down .
I had rather have one scratch my head i’ the sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster’d .
Masters of the people , Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter That’s thousand to one good one when you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one on’s ears to hear it Proceed , Cominius .
Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off
Let’s beat him before his whore .
Look whe er the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot .
Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance
Alice , tu as été en Angleterre , et tu parles bien le langage .
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so , But kindness , nobler ever than revenge , And nature , stronger than his just occasion , Made him give battle to the lioness , Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling , From miserable slumber I awaked .
Un peu , madame .
Kiss me , Doll .
Je te prie , m enseignez . Il faut que j apprenne à parler . Comment appelez vous la main en anglais
Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction What says th almanac to that
La main Elle est appelée de hand .
And look whether the fiery trigon , his man , be not lisping to his master’s old tables , his notebook , his counsel keeper .
De hand . Et les doigts
Thou dost give me flattering busses .
By my troth , I kiss thee with a most constant heart .
Les doigts Ma foi , j oublie les doigts mais je me souviendrai . Les doigts Je pense qu ils sont appelés de fingres oui , de fingres .
I am old , I am old .
La main , de hand les doigts , de fingres . Je pense que je suis le bon écolier . J ai gagné deux mots d anglais vitement . Comment appelez vous les ongles
I love thee better than I love e er a scurvy young boy of them all .
Les ongles Nous les appelons de nails .
De nails . Écoutez . Dites moi si je parle bien de hand , de fingres , et de nails .
What stuff wilt have a kirtle of I shall receive money o Thursday shalt have a cap tomorrow . A merry song Come , it grows late . We’ll to bed . Thou lt forget me when I am gone .
C est bien dit , madame . Il est fort bon anglais .
Dites moi l anglais pour le bras .
And here is my speech . Stand aside , nobility .
De arme , madame .
O Jesu , this is excellent sport , i faith
Weep not , sweet queen , for trickling tears are vain .
O the father , how he holds his countenance
For God’s sake , lords , convey my tristful queen , For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes .
O Jesu , he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see .
Peace , good pint pot . Peace , good tickle brain . Harry , I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time , but also how thou art accompanied . For though the camomile , the more it is trodden on , the faster it grows , so youth , the more it is wasted , the sooner it wears . That thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word , partly my own opinion , but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me . If then thou be son to me , here lies the point why , being son to me , art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries A question not to be asked . Shall the sun of England prove a thief and take purses A question to be asked . There is a thing , Harry , which thou hast often heard of , and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch , as ancient writers do report , doth defile so doth the company thou keepest . For , Harry , now I do not speak to thee , in drink but in tears not in pleasure , but in passion not in words only , but in woes also . And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company , but I know not his name .
Are you his brother
Was ’t you he rescued
Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him
Twas I , but ’tis not I . I do not shame To tell you what I was , since my conversion So sweetly tastes , being the thing I am .
But for the bloody napkin
By and by . When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed As how I came into that desert place In brief , he led me to the gentle duke , Who gave me fresh array and entertainment , Committing me unto my brother’s love , Who led me instantly unto his cave , There stripped himself , and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away , Which all this while had bled . And now he fainted , And cried in fainting upon Rosalind . Brief , I recovered him , bound up his wound , And after some small space , being strong at heart ,
Prison , my lord
I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter’d feebly . It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue , and Most dignifies the haver if it be , The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised . At sixteen years , When Tarquin made a head for Rome , he fought Beyond the mark of others our then dictator , Whom with all praise I point at , saw him fight , When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him be bestrid An o’er press’d Roman and i’ the consul’s view Slew three opposers Tarquin’s self he met , And struck him on his knee in that day’s feats , When he might act the woman in the scene , He proved best man i’ the field , and for his meed Was brow bound with the oak . His pupil age Man enter’d thus , he waxed like a sea , And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch’d all swords of the garland . For this last , Before and in Corioli , let me say , I cannot speak him home he stopp’d the fliers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport as weeds before A vessel under sail , so men obey’d And fell below his stem his sword , death’s stamp , Where it did mark , it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood , whose every motion Was timed with dying cries alone he enter’d The mortal gate of the city , which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off , And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioli like a planet now all’s his When , by and by , the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Re quicken’d what in flesh was fatigate , And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking o’er the lives of men , as if ’Twere a perpetual spoil and till we call’d Both field and city ours , he never stood To ease his breast with panting .
Denmark’s a prison .
Then is the world one .
A goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , Denmark being one o th worst .
Nay , gentle madam , to him , comfort him .
We think not so , my lord .
Do , most dear Queen .
Why , then , ’tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so . To me it is a prison .
Do . Why , what else
Why then , your ambition makes it one . Tis too narrow for your mind .
Let me sit down . O Juno
O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that I have bad dreams .
Which dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .
A dream itself is but a shadow .
No , no , no , no , no .
Truly , and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow .
Et le coude
What manner of man , an it like your Majesty
Then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows . Shall we to th court For by my fay , I cannot reason .
D elbow .
We’ll wait upon you .
D elbow . Je m en fais la répétition de tous les mots que vous m avez appris dés à présent .
A goodly portly man , i faith , and a corpulent of a cheerful look , a pleasing eye , and a most noble carriage , and , as I think , his age some fifty , or , by r Lady , inclining to three score and now I remember me , his name is Falstaff . If that man should be lewdly given , he deceiveth me , for , Harry , I see virtue in his looks . If then the tree may be known by the fruit , as the fruit by the tree , then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that Falstaff him keep with , the rest banish . And tell me now , thou naughty varlet , tell me , where hast thou been this month
Il est trop difficile , madame , comme je pense .
Dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for me , and I’ll play my father .
Excusez moi , Alice . Écoutez de hand , de fingres , de nails , de arma , de bilbow .
Depose me If thou dost it half so gravely , so majestically , both in word and matter , hang me up by the heels for a rabbit sucker or a poulter’s hare .
D elbow , madame .
Well , here I am set .
Ô Seigneur Dieu Je m en oublie d elbow . Comment appelez vous le col
And here I stand . Judge , my masters .
De nick , madame .
Now , Harry , whence come you
De nick . Et le menton
My noble lord , from Eastcheap .
See you here , sir
De chin .
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous .
De sin . Le col , de nick le menton , de sin .
Oh , fie , fie , fie
Oui . Sauf votre honneur , en vérité , vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d Angleterre .
Madam
He sent me hither , stranger as I am , To tell this story , that you might excuse His broken promise , and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind .
Je ne doute point d apprendre , par la grâce de Dieu , et en peu de temps .
Madam , O good Empress
Why , how now , Ganymede , sweet Ganymede
N avez vous pas déjà oublié ce que je vous ai enseigné
Sir , sir
Many will swoon when they do look on blood .
There is more in it . Cousin Ganymede .
Yes , my lord , yes . He at Philippi kept His sword e’en like a dancer , while I struck The lean and wrinkled Cassius , and ’twas I That the mad Brutus ended . He alone Dealt on lieutenantry , and no practice had In the brave squares of war , yet now no matter .
Look , he recovers .
Ah , stand by .
I would I were at home .
The Queen , my lord , the Queen .
We’ll lead you thither . I pray you , will you take him by the arm
Go to him , madam , speak to him . He is unqualitied with very shame .
Be of good cheer , youth . You a man You lack a man’s heart .
I do so , I confess it . Ah , sirrah , a body would think this was well counterfeited . I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited . Heigh ho .
This was not counterfeit . There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
Counterfeit , I assure you .
Well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
By my troth , thou lt set me a weeping an thou sayest so . Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return . Well , harken a th end .
Some sack , Francis .
O bind him , bind him Let him not come near me .
Anon , anon , sir .
More company The fiend is strong within him .
Ay me , poor man , how pale and wan he looks
Ha A bastard son of the King’s And art not thou Poins his brother
Well then , sustain me . Oh
What , will you murder me Thou jailer , thou , I am thy prisoner . Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue
Why , thou globe of sinful continents , what a life dost thou lead
Masters , let him go . He is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
A better than thou . I am a gentleman . Thou art a drawer .
Most noble sir , arise . The Queen approaches . Her head’s declined , and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue .
Go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
Very true , sir , and I come to draw you out by the ears .
I have offended reputation , A most unnoble swerving .
What wilt thou do , thou peevish officer Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself
Sir , the Queen .
O , the Lord preserve thy good Grace By my troth , welcome to London . Now the Lord bless that sweet face of thine . O Jesu , are you come from Wales
He is my prisoner . If I let him go , The debt he owes will be required of me .
Oh , whither hast thou led me , Egypt See How I convey my shame out of thine eyes By looking back what I have left behind ’Stroyed in dishonor .
Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty , by this light flesh and corrupt blood , thou art welcome .
O my lord , my lord , Forgive my fearful sails I little thought You would have followed .
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee . Bear me forthwith unto his creditor , And , knowing how the debt grows , I will pay it . Good Master Doctor , see him safe conveyed Home to my house . O most unhappy day
How You fat fool , I scorn you .
My lord , he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment , if you take not the heat .
Egypt , thou knew’st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings , And thou shouldst tow me after . O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st , and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me .
Oh , my pardon
Worthy man
He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him .
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties , dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness , who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased , Making and marring fortunes . You did know How much you were my conqueror , and that My sword , made weak by my affection , would Obey it on all cause .
Our spoils he kick’d at , And look’d upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world he covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them , and is content To spend the time to end it .
He’s right noble Let him be call’d for .
Call Coriolanus .
He doth appear .
The senate , Coriolanus , are well pleased To make thee consul .
I do owe them still My life and services .
It then remains That you do speak to the people .
I do beseech you , Let me o’erleap that custom , for I cannot Put on the gown , stand naked and entreat them , For my wounds’ sake , to give their suffrage please you That I may pass this doing .
Pardon , pardon
Fall not a tear , I say . One of them rates All that is won and lost . Give me a kiss .
Even this repays me . We sent our schoolmaster . Is he come back Love , I am full of lead . Some wine , Within there , and our viands Fortune knows We scorn her most when most she offers blows .
Non , je réciterai à vous promptement de hand , de fingre , de nails
De nails , madame .
De nails , de arme , de ilbow .
Sauf votre honneur , d elbow .
Ainsi dis je d elbow , de nick , et de sin . Comment appelez vous le pied et la robe
Le foot , madame , et le count .
Le foot et de count . Ô Seigneur Dieu Ils sont mots de son mauvais , corruptible , gros , et impudique , et non pour les dames d honneur d user . Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde . Foh Le foot et le count Néanmoins , je réciterai une autre fois ma leçon ensemble d hand , de fingre , de nails , d arme , d elbow , de nick , de sin , de foot , le count .
Excellent , madame
C est assez pour une fois Allons nous à d ner .
Let him appear that’s come from Antony . Know you him
Caesar , ’tis his schoolmaster An argument that he is plucked , when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing , Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by .
Approach and speak .
Such as I am , I come from Antony . I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea .
Be ’t so . Declare thine office .
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and Requires to live in Egypt which not granted , He lessens his requests , and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens . This for him . Next , Cleopatra does confess thy greatness , Submits her to thy might , and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs , Now hazarded to thy grace .
O most unhappy strumpet
Master , I am here entered in bond for you .
Out on thee , villain Wherefore dost thou mad me
Will you be bound for nothing Be mad , good master . Cry The devil
Sir , the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony .
God help poor souls How idly do they talk
Put them not to’t Pray you , go fit you to the custom and Take to you , as your predecessors have , Your honour with your form .
Go bear him hence Sister , go you with me .
It is apart That I shall blush in acting , and might well Be taken from the people .
Mark you that
Say now whose suit is he arrested at .
To brag unto them , thus I did , and thus Show them the unaching scars which I should hide , As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only
One Angelo , a goldsmith . Do you know him
I know the man . What is the sum he owes
Do not stand upon’t . We recommend to you , tribunes of the people , Our purpose to them and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour .
Two hundred ducats .
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour
Say , how grows it due
You see how he intends to use the people .
Due for a chain your husband had of him .
May they perceive’s intent He will require them , As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give .
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .
For Antony , I have no ears to his request . The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail , so she From Egypt drive her all disgracèd friend Or take his life there . This if she perform , She shall not sue unheard . So to them both .
Fortune pursue thee
Bring him through the bands .
To try thy eloquence now ’tis time . Dispatch . From Antony win Cleopatra . Promise , And in our name , what she requires . Add more , From thine invention , offers . Women are not In their best fortunes strong , but want will perjure The ne’er touched vestal . Try thy cunning , Thidias . Make thine own edict for thy pains , which we Will answer as a law .
Caesar , I go .
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw , And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves .
Caesar , I shall .
So I do . But i faith , I should have been a woman by right .
Come , you look paler and paler . Pray you , draw homewards . Good sir , go with us .
That will I , for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother , Rosalind .
I shall devise something . But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him . Will you go
What shall we do , Enobarbus
Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme .
Think and die .
An if he be not fought withal , my lord , Let us not live in France . Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
Is Antony or we in fault for this
Ô Dieu vivant , shall a few sprays of us , The emptying of our fathers luxury , Our scions , put in wild and savage stock , Spurt up so suddenly into the clouds And overlook their grafters
Antony only , that would make his will Lord of his reason . What though you fled From that great face of war , whose several ranges Frighted each other Why should he follow The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed , he being The merèd question . ’Twas a shame no less Than was his loss , to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing .
Normans , but bastard Normans , Norman bastards Mort de ma vie , if they march along Unfought withal , but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb ry and a dirty farm In that nook shotten isle of Albion .
Prithee , peace .
Dieu de batailles , where have they this mettle Is not their climate foggy , raw , and dull , On whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , Killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water , A drench for sur reined jades , their barley broth ,
Is that his answer
Ay , my lord .
The Queen shall then have courtesy , so she Will yield us up
He says so .
Let her know ’t . To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head , And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities .
Come , we’ll inform them Of our proceedings here on the marketplace , I know , they do attend us .
Whenas your husband all in rage today Came to my house and took away my ring , The ring I saw upon his finger now , Straight after did I meet him with a chain .
It may be so , but I did never see it . Come , jailer , bring me where the goldsmith is . I long to know the truth hereof at large .
God for Thy mercy , they are loose again
And come with naked swords . Let’s call more help To have them bound again .
Away They’ll kill us .
I see these witches are afraid of swords .
She that would be your wife now ran from you .
Come to the Centaur . Fetch our stuff from thence . I long that we were safe and sound aboard .
Faith , stay here this night . They will surely do us no harm . You saw they speak us fair , give us gold . Methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
That head , my lord
To him again . Tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him , from which the world should note Something particular . His coin , ships , legions , May be a coward’s , whose ministers would prevail Under the service of a child as soon As i’ th’ command of Caesar . I dare him therefore To lay his gay caparisons apart And answer me declined , sword against sword , Ourselves alone . I’ll write it . Follow me .
Yes , like enough , high battled Caesar will Unstate his happiness and be staged to th’ show Against a sworder I see men’s judgments are A parcel of their fortunes , and things outward Do draw the inward quality after them To suffer all alike . That he should dream , Knowing all measures , the full Caesar will Answer his emptiness Caesar , thou hast subdued His judgment too .
A messenger from Caesar .
What , no more ceremony See , my women , Against the blown rose may they stop their nose , That kneeled unto the buds . Admit him , sir .
Mine honesty and I begin to square . The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly . Yet he that can endure To follow with allegiance a fall’n lord Does conquer him that did his master conquer And earns a place i’ th’ story .
Caesar’s will
No such matter . I will not sort you with the rest of my servants , for , to speak to you like an honest man , I am most dreadfully attended . But in the beaten way of friendship , what make you at Elsinore
Hear it apart .
To visit you , my lord , no other occasion .
None but friends . Say boldly .
Beggar that I am , I am even poor in thanks but I thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny . Were you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come , come , deal justly with me . Come , come . Nay , speak .
So haply are they friends to Antony .
What should we say , my lord
He needs as many , sir , as Caesar has , Or needs not us . If Caesar please , our master Will leap to be his friend . For us , you know Whose he is we are , and that is Caesar’s .
Why , any thing , but to th purpose . You were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color . I know the good king and queen have sent for you .
So . Thus then , thou most renowned Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand’st , Further than he is Caesar .
To what end , my lord
Go on . Right royal .
That you must teach me . But let me conjure you , by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the obligation of our ever preserved love , and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no .
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love , but as you feared him .
What say you
Nay , then , I have an eye of you If you love me , hold not off .
My lord , we were sent for .
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat And shall our quick blood , spirited with wine , Seem frosty Oh , for honor of our land , Let us not hang like roping icicles Upon our houses thatch , whiles a more frosty people Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields Poor we may call them in their native lords .
By faith and honor , Our madams mock at us and plainly say Our mettle is bred out and they will give Their bodies to the lust of English youth To new store France with bastard warriors .
And teach lavoltas high , and swift corantos , Saying our grace is only in our heels And that we are most lofty runaways . They bid us to the English dancing schools .
Where is Montjoy the herald Speed him hence . Let him greet England with our sharp defiance . Up , princes , and , with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords , hie to the field Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France You dukes of Orléans , Bourbon , and of Berri , Alençon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy Jacques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpré , Roussi , and Faulconbridge , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois High dukes , great princes , barons , lords , and knights , For your great seats now quit you of great shames . Bar Harry England , that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur . Rush on his host , as doth the melted snow Upon the valleys , whose low vassal seat The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon . Go down upon him you have power enough And in a captive chariot into Rouen Bring him our prisoner .
Oh
The scars upon your honor therefore he Does pity as constrainèd blemishes , Not as deserved .
He is a god and knows What is most right . Mine honor was not yielded , But conquered merely .
To be sure of that , I will ask Antony . Sir , sir , thou art so leaky That we must leave thee to thy sinking , for Thy dearest quit thee .
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him For he partly begs To be desired to give . It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon . But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud , The universal landlord .
What’s your name
My name is Thidias .
Most kind messenger , Say to great Caesar this in deputation I kiss his conqu’ring hand . Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at ’s feet , and there to kneel . Tell him , from his all obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt .
that claims marriage of me , i could find in my heart to stay here still , and turn witch .
I will not stay tonight for all the town . Therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
Once , if he do require our voices , we ought not to deny him .
We may , sir , if we will .
We have power in ourselves to do it , but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds , we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so , if he tell us his noble deeds , we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them . Ingratitude is monstrous , and for the multitude to be ingrateful , were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members , should bring ourselves to be monstrous members .
And to make us no better thought of , a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn , he himself stuck not to call us the many headed multitude .
We have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown , some black , some auburn , some bald , but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull , they would fly east , west , north , south , and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o’ the compass .
Sblood , my lord , they are false . Nay , I’ll tickle you for a young prince , i faith .
Swearest thou Ungracious boy , henceforth ne er look on me . Thou art violently carried away from grace . There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man . A tun of man is thy companion . Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors , that bolting hutch of beastliness , that swollen parcel of dropsies , that huge bombard of sack , that stuffed cloakbag of guts , that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly , that reverend Vice , that gray iniquity , that father ruffian , that vanity in years Wherein is he good , but to taste sack and drink it Wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it Wherein cunning but in craft Wherein crafty but in villany Wherein villanous but in all things Wherein worthy but in nothing
I would your Grace would take me with you . Whom means your Grace
That villanous abominable misleader of youth , Falstaff , that old white bearded Satan .
My lord , the man I know .
I know thou dost .
We shall find a time , Audrey . Patience , gentle Audrey .
Faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman’s saying .
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know . That he is old , the more the pity his white hairs do witness it . But that he is , saving your reverence , a whoremaster , that I utterly deny . If sack and sugar be a fault , God help the wicked . If to be old and merry be a sin , then many an old host that I know is damned . If to be fat be to be hated , then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved . No , my good lord , banish Peto , banish Bardolph , banish Poins , but for sweet Jack Falstaff , kind Jack Falstaff , true Jack Falstaff , valiant Jack Falstaff , and therefore more valiant being , as he is old Jack Falstaff , banish not him thy Harry’s company , banish not him thy Harry’s company . Banish plump Jack , and banish all the world .
A most wicked Sir Oliver , Audrey , a most vile Martext . But , Audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
Ay , I know who ’tis . He hath no interest in me in the world .
Here comes the man you mean .
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown . By my troth , we that have good wits have much to answer for . We shall be flouting . We cannot hold .
Good ev n , Audrey .
God gi good ev n , William .
And good ev n to you , sir .
Good ev n , gentle friend . Cover thy head , cover thy head . Nay , prithee , be covered . How old are you , friend
’Tis your noblest course . Wisdom and fortune combating together , If that the former dare but what it can , No chance may shake it . Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand .
Your Caesar’s father oft , When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in , Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place As it rained kisses .
Favors By Jove that thunders What art thou , fellow
One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man , and worthiest To have command obeyed .
You will be whipped .
Have you no ears I am Antony yet .
You whoreson candle mine , you how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest , virtuous , civil gentlewoman
God’s blessing of your good heart , and so she is , by my troth .
Didst thou hear me
Yea , and you knew me , as you did when you ran away by Gad’s Hill . You knew I was at your back , and spoke it on purpose to try my patience .
No , no , no not so . I did not think thou wast within hearing .
I shall drive you , then , to confess the wilfull abuse , and then I know how to handle you .
No abuse , Hal , o mine honor , no abuse .
Not to dispraise me and call me pantier and bread chipper and I know not what
Take hence this jack and whip him .
No abuse , Hal .
’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp Than with an old one dying .
No abuse
Moon and stars Whip him . Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar , should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra Whip him , fellows , Till like a boy , you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy . Take him hence .
No abuse , Ned , i th world , honest Ned , none . I dispraised him before the wicked , that the wicked might not fall in love with thee in which doing , I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject , and thy father is to give me thanks for it . No abuse , Hal . None , Ned , none . No , faith , boys , none .
Mark Antony
Tug him away Being whipped , Bring him again . This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him .
You were half blasted ere I knew you . Ha Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome , Forborne the getting of a lawful race , And by a gem of women , to be abused By one that looks on feeders
Good my lord
You have been a boggler ever . But when we in our viciousness grow hard Oh , misery on ’t the wise gods seel our eyes , In our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us Adore our errors , laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion .
I am sorry , sir , that I have hindered you , But I protest he had the chain of me , Though most dishonestly he doth deny it .
How is the man esteemed here in the city
Of very reverend reputation , sir , Of credit infinite , highly beloved , Second to none that lives here in the city . His word might bear my wealth at any time .
Speak softly . Yonder , as I think , he walks .
Tis so and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have . Good sir , draw near to me . I’ll speak to him . Signior Antipholus , I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble , And not without some scandal to yourself , With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain , which now you wear so openly . Beside the charge , the shame , imprisonment , You have done wrong to this my honest friend , Who , but for staying on our controversy , Had hoisted sail and put to sea today . This chain you had of me . Can you deny it
Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would fly
Nay , your wit will not so soon out as another man’s will ’tis strongly wedged up in a block head , but if it were at liberty , ’twould , sure , southward .
Why that way
To lose itself in a fog , where being three parts melted away with rotten dews , the fourth would return for conscience sake , to help to get thee a wife .
You are never without your tricks you may , you may .
Are you all resolved to give your voices But that’s no matter , the greater part carries it . I say , if he would incline to the people , there was never a worthier man .
Here he comes , and in the gown of humility mark his behavior . We are not to stay all together , but to come by him where he stands , by ones , by twos , and by threes . He’s to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour , in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me , and I direct you how you shall go by him . ALL Content , content .
Oh , is ’t come to this
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher . Nay , you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey’s , besides what hotter hours , Unregistered in vulgar fame , you have Luxuriously picked out . For I am sure , Though you can guess what temperance should be , You know not what it is .
Wherefore is this
To let a fellow that will take rewards And say God quit you be familiar with My playfellow , your hand , this kingly seal And plighter of high hearts Oh , that I were Upon the hill of Basan , to outroar The hornèd herd For I have savage cause , And to proclaim it civilly were like A haltered neck which does the hangman thank For being yare about him .
Is he whipped
Five and twenty , sir .
A ripe age . Is thy name William
William , sir .
A fair name . Wast born i th forest here
Ay , sir , I thank God .
Thank God . A good answer . Art rich
Faith , sir , so so .
So so is good , very good , very excellent good . And yet it is not it is but so so . Art thou wise
Ay , sir , I have a pretty wit .
Why , thou sayst well . I do now remember a saying The fool doth think he is wise , but the wise man knows himself to be a fool . The heathen philosopher , when he had a desire to eat a grape , would open his lips when he put it into his mouth , meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open . You do love this maid
I do , sir .
Give me your hand . Art thou learned
Soundly , my lord .
No , sir .
Cried he And begged he pardon
He did ask favor .
I will tell you why . So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery , and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather . I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth , forgone all custom of exercises , and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame , the earth , seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy , the air look you , this brave o erhanging firmament , this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why , it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors . What a piece of work is a man How noble in reason , how infinite in faculty In form and moving how express and admirable In action how like an angel , in apprehension how like a god The beauty of the world . The paragon of animals . And yet , to me , what is this quintessence of dust Man delights not me . No , nor woman neither , though by your smiling you seem to say so .
My lord , there was no such stuff in my thoughts .
Why did you laugh then , when I said man delights not me
To think , my lord , if you delight not in man , what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you . We coted them on the way , and hither are they coming to offer you service .
He that plays the king shall be welcome . His majesty shall have tribute of me . The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target , the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o th sear , and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt for ’t . What players are they
I do , I will .
O , my lord , my lord , the Sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door .
Out , you rogue . Play out the play . I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff .
If that thy father live , let him repent Thou wast not made his daughter , and be thou sorry To follow Caesar in his triumph , since Thou hast been whipped for following him . Henceforth The white hand of a lady fever thee Shake thou to look on ’t . Get thee back to Caesar . Tell him thy entertainment . Look thou say He makes me angry with him , for he seems Proud and disdainful , harping on what I am , Not what he knew I was . He makes me angry , And at this time most easy ’tis to do ’t , When my good stars , that were my former guides , Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires Into th’ abysm of hell . If he mislike My speech and what is done , tell him he has Hipparchus , my enfranchèd bondman , whom He may at pleasure whip , or hang , or torture , As he shall like , to quit me . Urge it thou . Hence with thy stripes , begone
O Jesu , my lord , my lord
Have you done yet
Heigh , heigh , the devil rides upon a fiddlestick . What’s the matter
Alack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , And it portends alone the fall of Antony .
The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door . They are come to search the house . Shall I let them in
Dost thou hear , Hal Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit . Thou art essentially made , without seeming so .
I think I had . I never did deny it .
This becomes the great Sorry am I his numbers are so few , His soldiers sick and famished in their march , For , I am sure , when he shall see our army He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom .
Yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
Therefore , Lord Constable , haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give . Prince Dauphin , you shall stay with us in Rouen .
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it
Not so , I do beseech your Majesty .
These ears of mine , thou know’st did hear thee . Fie on thee , wretch . Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort .
Be patient , for you shall remain with us . Now forth , Lord Constable and princes all , And quickly bring us word of England’s fall .
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus . I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand .
I dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
Hold , hurt him not , for God’s sake . He is mad . Some get within him take his sword away . Bind dromio too , and bear them to my house
Run , master , run . For God’s sake , take a house . This is some priory . In , or we are spoiled .
O sir , you are not right have you not known The worthiest men have done’t
What must I say ‘I Pray , sir’ Plague upon’t I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace ‘Look , sir , my wounds I got them in my country’s service , when Some certain of your brethren roar’d and ran From the noise of our own drums . ’
O me , the gods You must not speak of that you must desire them To think upon you .
I must stay his time .
Think upon me hang ’em I would they would forget me , like the virtues Which our divines lose by ’em .
To flatter Caesar , would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points
Not know me yet
You’ll mar all I’ll leave you pray you , speak to ’em , I pray you , In wholesome manner .
Coldhearted toward me
Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean .
Ah , dear , if I be so , From my cold heart let heaven engender hail , And poison it in the source , and the first stone Drop in my neck . As it determines , so Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite , Till by degrees the memory of my womb , Together with my brave Egyptians all , By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey
So , here comes a brace .
I am satisfied . Caesar sits down in Alexandria , where I will oppose his fate . Our force by land Hath nobly held . Our severed navy too Have knit again , and fleet , threat’ning most sealike . Where hast thou been , my heart Dost thou hear , lady If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips , I will appear in blood . I and my sword will earn our chronicle . There’s hope in ’t yet .
That’s my brave lord
I will be treble sinewed , hearted , breathed , And fight maliciously . For when mine hours Were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives Of me for jests but now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me . Come , Let’s have one other gaudy night . Call to me All my sad captains . Fill our bowls once more . Let’s mock the midnight bell .
It is my birthday . I had thought t’ have held it poor but since my lord Is Antony again , I will be Cleopatra .
We will yet do well .
Call all his noble captains to my lord .
Do so . We’ll speak to them , and tonight I’ll force The wine peep through their scars . Come on , my Queen , There’s sap in ’t yet . The next time I do fight I’ll make Death love me , for I will contend Even with his pestilent scythe .
Then learn this of me to have is to have . For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink , being poured out of a cup into a glass , by filling the one doth empty the other . For all your writers do consent that ipse is he . Now , you are not ipse , for I am he .
Which he , sir
Now he’ll outstare the lightning . To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear , and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge and I see still A diminution in our captain’s brain Restores his heart . When valor preys on reason , It eats the sword it fights with . I will seek Some way to leave him .
He , sir , that must marry this woman . Therefore , you clown , abandon which is , in the vulgar , leave the society which in the boorish is company of this female which in the common is woman which together is , abandon the society of this female , or , clown , thou perishest or , to thy better understanding , diest or , to wit , I kill thee , make thee away , translate thy life into death , thy liberty into bondage . I will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel . I will bandy with thee in faction . I will o errun thee with policy . I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways . Therefore tremble and depart .
Do , good William .
And thou a natural coward without instinct .
God rest you merry , sir .
I deny your major . If you will deny the Sheriff , so if not , let him enter . If I become not a cart as well as another man , a plague on my bringing up . I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another .
Go , hide thee behind the arras . The rest walk up above . Now , my masters , for a true face and good conscience .
Our master and mistress seeks you . Come away , away .
See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us . Is she of the wicked , is thine hostess here of the wicked , or is thy boy of the wicked , or honest Bardolph , whose zeal burns in his nose , of the wicked
Both which I have had , but their date is out and therefore I’ll hide me .
Trip , Audrey , trip , Audrey . I attend , I attend .
Answer , thou dead elm , answer .
Call in the Sheriff .
The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable , and his face is Lucifer’s privy kitchen , where he doth nothing but roast malt worms . For the boy , there is a good angel about him , but the devil outbids him too .
Now , Master Sheriff , what is your will with me
For the women
First pardon me , my lord . A hue and cry Hath followed certain men unto this house .
For one of them , she’s in hell already and burns poor souls . For the other , I owe her money , and whether she be damned for that I know not .
What men
No , I warrant you .
One of them is well known , my gracious lord , A gross fat man .
No , I think thou art not I think thou art quit for that . Marry , there is another indictment upon thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house contrary to the law , for the which I think thou wilt howl .
All vitlars do so . What’s a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent
You , gentlewoman .
What says your Grace
His grace says that which his flesh rebels against .
You know the cause , air , of my standing here .
We do , sir tell us what hath brought you to’t .
Mine own desert .
Your own desert
Ay , but not mine own desire .
How not your own desire
No , sir , ’twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging .
He calls me boy and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt . My messenger He hath whipped with rods , dares me to personal combat , Caesar to Antony . Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die , meantime Laugh at his challenge .
You must think , if we give you any thing , we hope to gain by you .
Caesar must think When one so great begins to rage , he’s hunted Even to falling . Give him no breath , but now Make boot of his distraction . Never anger Made good guard for itself .
Well then , I pray , your price o’ the consulship
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight . Within our files there are , Of those that served Mark Antony but late , Enough to fetch him in . See it done And feast the army . We have store to do ’t , And they have earned the waste . Poor Antony
The price is to ask it kindly .
Kindly Sir , I pray , let me ha’t I have wounds to show you , which shall be yours in private . Your good voice , sir what say you
You shall ha’ it , worthy sir .
A match , sir . There’s in all two worthy voices begged . I have your alms adieu .
But this is something odd .
Be quiet , people . Wherefore throng you hither
An ’twere to give again , but ’tis no matter .
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence . Let us come in , that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery .
I knew he was not in his perfect wits .
I am sorry now that I did draw on him .
How long hath this possession held the man
This week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , And much different from the man he was . But till this afternoon his passion Ne er brake into extremity of rage .
Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea Buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye Stray’d his affection in unlawful love , A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing Which of these sorrows is he subject to
To none of these , except it be the last , Namely , some love that drew him oft from home .
You should for that have reprehended him .
Even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
How chances it they travel Their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
Why , so I did .
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city Are they so followed
Ay , but not rough enough .
No , indeed are they not .
How comes it Do they grow rusty
Nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace . But there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t . These are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither .
He will not fight with me , Domitius
No .
Why should he not
He thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , He is twenty men to one .
Tomorrow , soldier , By sea and land I’ll fight . Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again . Woo’t thou fight well
I’ll strike and cry , Take all .
Well said . Come on Call forth my household servants .
Let’s tonight Be bounteous at our meal .
Who knocks so loud at door Look to th door there , Francis .
Give me thy hand . Thou hast been rightly honest . So hast thou , Thou , and thou , and thou . You have served me well , And kings have been your fellows .
What means this
Peto , how now , what news
’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots Out of the mind .
The King your father is at Westminster , And there are twenty weak and wearied posts Come from the north , and as I came along I met and overtook a dozen captains , Bareheaded , sweating , knocking at the taverns And asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff .
By heaven , Poins , I feel me much to blame So idly to profane the precious time When tempest of commotion , like the south Borne with black vapour , doth begin to melt And drop upon our bare unarmèd heads . Give me my sword and cloak . Falstaff , good night .
Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night , and we must hence and leave it unpicked .
More knocking at the door
How now , what’s the matter
How now , Captain Fluellen Come you from the bridge
I assure you , there is very excellent services committed at the bridge .
Is the duke of Exeter safe
The duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon , and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power . He is not , God be praised and blessed , any hurt in the world , but keeps the bridge most valiantly , with excellent discipline . There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge . I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony , and he is a man of no estimation in the world , but I did see him do as gallant service .
What do you call him
He is called Aunchient Pistol .
I know him not .
Here is the man .
And thou art honest too . I wish I could be made so many men , And all of you clapped up together in An Antony , that I might do you service So good as you have done .
The gods forbid
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight . Scant not my cups , and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too , And suffered my command .
What does he mean
To make his followers weep .
Tend me tonight . May be it is the period of your duty . Haply you shall not see me more , or if , A mangled shadow . Perchance tomorrow You’ll serve another master . I look on you As one that takes his leave . Mine honest friends , I turn you not away , but , like a master Married to your good service , stay till death . Tend me tonight two hours , I ask no more , And the gods yield you for ’t
What mean you , sir , To give them this discomfort Look , they weep , And I , an ass , am onion eyed . For shame , Transform us not to women .
As fat as butter .
The man , I do assure you is not here , For I myself at this time have employed him . And , Sheriff , I will engage my word to thee That I will by tomorrow dinner time Send him to answer thee or any man For any thing he shall be charged withal . And so let me entreat you leave the house .
Pray you now , if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul , I have here the customary gown .
I will , my lord . There are two gentlemen Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks .
You have deserved nobly of your country , and you have not deserved nobly .
It may be so . If he have robbed these men , He shall be answerable and so farewell .
Your enigma
Good night , my noble lord .
You have been a scourge to her enemies , you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people .
I think it is good morrow , is it not
Indeed , my lord , I think it be two o clock .
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love . I will , sir , flatter my sworn brother , the people , to earn a dearer estimation of them ’tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart , I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is , sir , I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers . Therefore , beseech you , I may be consul .
We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily .
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s . Go call him forth .
You have received many wounds for your country .
Falstaff Fast asleep behind the arras , and snorting like a horse .
Hark , how hard he fetches breath . Search his pockets .
What hast thou found
Ho , ho , ho Now the witch take me if I meant it thus Grace grow where those drops fall My hearty friends , You take me in too dolorous a sense , For I spake to you for your comfort , did desire you To burn this night with torches . Know , my hearts , I hope well of tomorrow , and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor . Let’s to supper , come , And drown consideration .
As roughly as my modesty would let me .
Haply in private .
And in assemblies too .
Ay , but not enough .
It was the copy of our conference . In bed he slept not for my urging it At board he fed not for my urging it . Alone , it was the subject of my theme In company I often glancèd it . Still did I tell him it was vile and bad .
And thereof came it that the man was mad . The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth . It seems his sleeps were hinder’d by thy railing , And therefore comes it that his head is light . Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings . Unquiet meals make ill digestions . Thereof the raging fire of fever bred , And what’s a fever but a fit of madness Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls . Sweet recreation barred , what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy , Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair , And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life In food , in sport , and life preserving rest To be disturbed , would mad or man or beast . The consequence is , then , thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her That , but seeing , you should love her And loving , woo And wooing , she should grant And will you persever to enjoy her
Neither call the giddiness of it in question , the poverty of her , the small acquaintance , my sudden wooing , nor her sudden consenting , but say with me I love Aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other . It shall be to your good , for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
You have my consent . Let your wedding be tomorrow . Thither will I invite the duke and all’s contented followers . Go you and prepare Aliena , for look you , here comes my Rosalind .
God save you , brother .
And you , fair sister .
O my dear Orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .
You must away to court , sir , presently . A dozen captains stay at door for you .
Pay the musicians , sirrah . Farewell , hostess . Farewell , Doll . You see , my good wenches , how men of merit are sought after . The undeserver may sleep when the man of action is called on . Farewell , good wenches . If I be not sent away post , I will see you again ere I go .
I cannot speak . If my heart be not ready to burst well , sweet Jack , have a care of thyself .
Farewell , farewell .
Well , fare thee well . I have known thee these twenty nine years , come peascod time , but an honester and truer hearted man well , fare thee well .
Mistress Tearsheet
Brother , good night . Tomorrow is the day .
What’s the matter
It will determine one way . Fare you well . Heard you of nothing strange about the streets
Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master .
Nothing . What news
O , run , Doll , run , run , good Doll . Come . She comes blubbered . Yea Will you come , Doll
Belike ’tis but a rumor . Good night to you .
Well , sir , good night .
Soldiers , have careful watch .
And you . Good night , good night .
Here we . And if tomorrow Our navy thrive , I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up .
’Tis a brave army , and full of purpose .
Peace What noise
List , list
Hark
Music i’ th’ air .
Under the earth .
It signs well , does it not
No .
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them . I will make much of your voices , and so trouble you no further .
The gods give you joy , sir , heartily
Most sweet voices Better it is to die , better to starve , Than crave the hire which first we do deserve . Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here , To beg of Hob and Dick , that do appear , Their needless vouches Custom calls me to’t What custom wills , in all things should we do’t , The dust on antique time would lie unswept , And mountainous error be too highly heapt For truth to o’er peer . Rather than fool it so , Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus . I am half through The one part suffer’d , the other will I do .
Here come more voices . Your voices for your voices I have fought Watch’d for your voices for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six I have seen and heard of for your voices have Done many things , some less , some more your voices Indeed I would be consul .
Peace , I say What should this mean
’Tis the god Hercules , whom Antony loved , Now leaves him .
What , are they children Who maintains em How are they escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing Will they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession
Walk . Let’s see if other watchmen Do hear what we do .
Faith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy . There was , for a while , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .
How now , masters
Is ’t possible
How now How now Do you hear this
Oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
Ay . Is ’t not strange
Do the boys carry it away
Do you hear , masters Do you hear
Ay , that they do , my lord . Hercules and his load too .
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter Let’s see how it will give off .
It is not very strange . For my uncle is King of Denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little . Sblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
Content . ’Tis strange .
There are the players .
Gentlemen , you are welcome to Elsinore . Your hands , come then . Th appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony . Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players , which , I tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours . You are welcome . But my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived .
It is my arm .
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
Wounded it is , but with the eyes of a lady .
She never reprehended him but mildly When he demeaned himself rough , rude , and wildly . Why bear you these rebukes and answer not
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher
She did betray me to my own reproof . Good people , enter and lay hold on him .
Ay , and greater wonders than that .
No , not a creature enters in my house .
Then let your servants bring my husband forth .
Oh , I know where you are . Nay , ’tis true . There was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of I came , saw , and overcame . For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked , no sooner looked but they loved , no sooner loved but they sighed , no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason , no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage , which they will climb incontinent , or else be incontinent before marriage . They are in the very wrath of love , and they will together . Clubs cannot part them .
Neither he took this place for sanctuary , And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again Or lose my labor in assaying it .
They shall be married tomorrow , and I will bid the duke to the nuptial . But Oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes . By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart heaviness , by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
I will attend my husband , be his nurse , Diet his sickness , for it is my office And will have no attorney but myself And therefore let me have him home with me .
Be patient , for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approvd means I have , With wholesome syrups , drugs , and holy prayers , To make of him a formal man again . It is a branch and parcel of mine oath , A charitable duty of my order . Therefore depart and leave him here with me .
I will not hence and leave my husband here And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife .
Eros Mine armor , Eros
Sleep a little .
No , my chuck . Eros , come , mine armor , Eros
Come , good fellow , put thine iron on . If fortune be not ours today , it is Because we brave her . Come .
Nay , I’ll help too . What’s this for
Ah , let be , let be Thou art The armorer of my heart . False , false . This , this .
Sooth , la , I’ll help . Thus it must be .
Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick But , ere they come , bid them o erread these letters And well consider of them . Make good speed .
Well , well , We shall thrive now . Seest thou , my good fellow Go put on thy defenses .
Briefly , sir .
Is not this buckled well
How many thousand of my poorest subjects Are at this hour asleep O sleep , O gentle sleep , Nature’s soft nurse , how have I frighted thee , That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down And steep my senses in forgetfulness Why rather , sleep , liest thou in smoky cribs , Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee And hushed with buzzing night flies to thy slumber , Than in the perfumed chambers of the great , Under the canopies of costly state , And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody O thou dull god , why liest thou with the vile In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch A watch case or a common larum bell Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast Seal up the shipboy’s eyes , and rock his brains In cradle of the rude imperious surge And in the visitation of the winds , Who take the ruffian billows by the top , Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them With deafening clamor in the slippery clouds That with the hurly death itself awakes Canst thou , O partial sleep , give thy repose To the wet sea boy in an hour so rude ,
Rarely , rarely . He that unbuckles this , till we do please To doff ’t for our repose , shall hear a storm . Thou fumblest , Eros , and my Queen’s a squire More tight at this than thou . Dispatch . O love , That thou couldst see my wars today , and knew’st The royal occupation Thou shouldst see A workman in ’t .
Captain , I thee beseech to do me favors . The duke of Exeter doth love thee well .
Ay , I praise God , and I have merited some love at his hands .
Bardolph , a soldier firm and sound of heart And of buxom valor , hath , by cruel Fate And giddy Fortune’s furious fickle wheel , That goddess blind That stands upon the rolling restless stone
By your patience , Aunchient Pistol , Fortune is painted blind , with a muffler afore her eyes , to signify to you that Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you , which is the moral of it , that she is turning and inconstant , and mutability and variation and her foot , look you , is fixed upon a spherical stone , which rolls and rolls and rolls . In good truth , the poet makes a most excellent description of it . Fortune is an excellent moral .
Fortune is Bardolph’s foe and frowns on him , For he hath stolen a pax and hangèd must he be . A damnèd death Let gallows gape for dog , let man go free , And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate . But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price . Therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice And let not Bardolph’s vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach . Speak , Captain , for his life , and I will thee requite .
Aunchient Pistol , I do partly understand your meaning .
Why then , rejoice therefore .
He has done nobly , and cannot go without any honest man’s voice .
Therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy , and make him good friend to the people
Amen , amen . God save thee , noble consul
Worthy voices
You have stood your limitation and the tribunes Endue you with the people’s voice remains That , in the official marks invested , you Anon do meet the senate .
Is this done
Nothing but papers , my lord .
The custom of request you have discharged The people do admit you , and are summon’d To meet anon , upon your approbation .
Good morrow to thee . Welcome . Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge . To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight .
Let’s see what they be . Read them .
Where at the senate house
A thousand , sir , Early though ’t be , have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you .
There , Coriolanus .
Item , a capon , … 2s . 2d . Item , sauce , … 4d . Item , sack , two gallons , … 5s . 8d . Item , anchovies and sack after supper , , , , 2s . 6d . Item , bread , ob .
May I change these garments
The morn is fair . Good morrow , General .
O monstrous But one halfpennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack What there is else , keep close . We’ll read it at more advantage . There let him sleep till day . I’ll to the court in the morning . We must all to the wars , and thy place shall be honorable . I’ll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot , and I know his death will be a march of twelve score . The money shall be paid back again with advantage . Be with me betimes in the morning , and so good morrow , Peto .
You may , sir .
Good morrow , General .
Good morrow , good my lord .
That I’ll straight do and , knowing myself again , Repair to the senate house .
I’ll keep you company . Will you along
’Tis well blown , lads . This morning , like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note , begins betimes . So , so . Come , give me that . This way . Well said . Fare thee well , dame .
Whate’er becomes of me , This is a soldier’s kiss . Rebukable And worthy shameful check it were to stand On more mechanic compliment . I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel . Adieu .
Please you retire to your chamber
Why , then , tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind
I can live no longer by thinking .
Lead me . He goes forth gallantly . That he and Caesar might Determine this great war in single fight Then Antony but now . Well , on .
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking . Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit . I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch I say I know you are . Neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good , and not to grace me . Believe then , if you please , that I can do strange things . I have , since I was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable . If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her . I know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .
Speak’st thou in sober meanings
By my life I do , which I tender dearly , though I say I am a magician . Therefore put you in your best array , bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow , you shall , and to Rosalind , if you will .
Look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
Youth , you have done me much ungentleness To show the letter that I writ to you .
In what , my dear lord
I am but mad north north west . When the wind is southerly , I know a hawk from a handsaw .
Well be with you , gentlemen .
Be quiet and depart . Thou shalt not have him .
Hark you , Guildenstern , and you too at each ear a hearer . That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts
Happily he’s the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity .
You say right , sir . O Monday morning , ’twas so indeed .
Come , go . I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess .
My lord , I have news to tell you .
My lord , I have news to tell you . When Roscius was an actor in Rome
By this , I think , the dial points at five . Anon , I’m sure , the Duke himself in person Comes this way to the melancholy vale , The place of death and sorry execution Behind the ditches of the abbey here .
Upon what cause
The actors are come hither , my lord .
Buzz , buzz .
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant , Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town , Beheaded publicly for his offense .
Upon my honor
See where they come . We will behold his death .
Then came each actor on his ass
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
Yet once again proclaim it publicly , If any friend will pay the sum for him , He shall not die so much we tender him .
The gods make this a happy day to Antony
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land
Hadst thou done so , The kings that have revolted , and the soldier That has this morning left thee , would have still Followed thy heels .
Who’s gone this morning
Who One ever near thee . Call for Enobarbus He shall not hear thee , or from Caesar’s camp Say I am none of thine .
What sayest thou
Sir , He is with Caesar .
Sir , his chests and treasure He has not with him .
Is he gone
Most certain .
Go , Eros , send his treasure after . Do it . Detain no jot , I charge thee . Write to him I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings . Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master . Oh , my fortunes have Corrupted honest men Dispatch . Enobarbus
We stay here for the people .
Fare you well .
He has it now , and by his looks methink ’Tis warm at ’s heart .
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds . will you dismiss the people
How now , my masters have you chose this man
He has our voices , sir .
And , in the calmest and most stillest night , With all appliances and means to boot , Deny it to a king Then , happy low , lie down . Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown .
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves .
Amen , sir to my poor unworthy notice , He mock’d us when he begg’d our voices .
Many good morrows to your Majesty .
Certainly He flouted us downright .
Is it good morrow , lords
No , ’tis his kind of speech he did not mock us .
Tis one o clock , and past .
Not one amongst us , save yourself , but says He used us scornfully he should have show’d us His marks of merit , wounds received for’s country .
Why , so he did , I am sure .
No , no no man saw ’em .
He said he had wounds , which he could show in private And with his hat , thus waving it in scorn , ‘I would be consul , ’ says he ‘aged custom , But by your voices , will not so permit me Your voices therefore . ’ When we granted that , Here was ‘I thank you for your voices thank you Your most sweet voices now you have left your voices , I have no further with you . ’ Was not this mockery
Why then , good morrow to you all , my lords . Have you read o er the letter that I sent you
We have , my liege .
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is , what rank diseases grow And with what danger near the heart of it .
It is but as a body yet distempered , Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine . My Lord Northumberland will soon be cooled .
O God , that one might read the book of fate And see the revolution of the times Make mountains level , and the continent , Weary of solid firmness , melt itself Into the sea , and other times to see The beachy girdle of the ocean Too wide for Neptune’s hips how chance’s mocks And changes fill the cup of alteration
I care not if I have . It is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you . You are there followed by a faithful shepherd . Look upon him , love him he worships you .
Good shepherd , tell this youth what ’tis to love .
It is to be all made of sighs and tears , And so am I for Phoebe .
And I for Ganymede .
And I for Rosalind .
Go forth , Agrippa , and begin the fight . Our will is Antony be took alive . Make it so known .
And I for no woman .
Caesar , I shall .
It is to be all made of faith and service , And so am I for Phoebe .
And I for Ganymede .
The time of universal peace is near . Prove this a prosp’rous day , the three nooked world Shall bear the olive freely .
And I for Rosalind .
And I for no woman .
Antony Is come into the field .
The best actors in the world , either for tragedy , comedy , history , pastoral , pastoral comical , historical pastoral , tragical historical , tragical comical historical pastoral , scene individable , or poem unlimited . Seneca cannot be too heavy , nor Plautus too light . For the law of writ and the liberty , these are the only men .
It is to be all made of fantasy , All made of passion and all made of wishes , All adoration , duty , and observance , All humbleness , all patience and impatience , All purity , all trial , all observance , And so am I for Phoebe .
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant , That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself .
And so am I for Ganymede .
O Jephthah , judge of Israel , what a treasure hadst thou
And so am I for Rosalind .
What a treasure had he , my lord
Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on Affairs of Antony , there did dissuade Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar And leave his master Antony . For this pains Caesar hath hanged him . Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust . I have done ill , Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more .
Why , One fair daughter and no more , The which he lovèd passing well .
Still on my daughter .
Am I not i th right , old Jephthah
If you call me Jephthah , my lord , I have a daughter that I love passing well .
Nay , that follows not .
What follows , then , my lord
Why ,
Justice , most sacred duke , against the Abbess .
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady . It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong .
May it please your Grace , Antipholus my husband , Whom I made lord of me and all I had At your important letters , this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him , That desp rately he hurried through the street , With him his bondman , all as mad as he , Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses , bearing thence Rings , jewels , any thing his rage did like . Once did I get him bound and sent him home Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went That here and there his fury had committed . Anon , I wot not by what strong escape , He broke from those that had the guard of him , And with his mad attendant and himself , Each one with ireful passion , with drawn swords , Met us again and , madly bent on us , Chased us away , till , raising of more aid , We came again to bind them . Then they fled Into this abbey , whither we pursued them , And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him out , Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence . Therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
Long since thy husband served me in my wars , And I to thee engaged a prince’s word , When thou didst make him master of thy bed , To do him all the grace and good I could .
Certainly , aunchient , it is not a thing to rejoice at , for if , look you , he were my brother , I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution , for discipline ought to be used .
Die and be damned , and figo for thy friendship
It is well .
These promises are fair , the parties sure , And our induction full of prosperous hope .
The fig of Spain
Enobarbus , Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with His bounty overplus . The messenger Came on my guard , and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules .
Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower , Will you sit down And Uncle Worcester A plague upon it , I have forgot the map .
I give it you .
Very good .
No , here it is . Sit , cousin Percy Sit , good cousin Hotspur , for by that name As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you His cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh He wisheth you in heaven .
Mock not , Enobarbus . I tell you true . Best you safed the bringer Out of the host . I must attend mine office , Or would have done ’t myself . Your Emperor Continues still a Jove .
Why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal . I remember him now , a bawd , a cutpurse .
And you in hell , As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of .
I’ll assure you , he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day . But it is very well what he has spoke to me , that is well , I warrant you , when time is serve .
I cannot blame him . At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , Of burning cressets , and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shaked like a coward .
I am alone the villain of the earth , And feel I am so most . O Antony , Thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid My better service , when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold This blows my heart . If swift thought break it not , a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought , but thought will do ’t , I feel . I fight against thee No , I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die . The foul’st best fits My latter part of life .
Why , so it would have done At the same season if your mother’s cat Had but kittened , though yourself had never been born .
Why , ’tis a gull , a fool , a rogue , that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier . And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders names , and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce , at such a breach , at such a convoy who came off bravely , who was shot , who disgraced , what terms the enemy stood on . And this they con perfectly in the phrase of war , which they
I say the earth did shake when I was born .
Why either were you ignorant to see’t , Or , seeing it , of such childish friendliness To yield your voices
Could you not have told him As you were lesson’d , when he had no power , But was a petty servant to the state , He was your enemy , ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I’ the body of the weal and now , arriving A place of potency and sway o’ the state , If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to the plebeii , your voices might Be curses to yourselves You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for , so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love , Standing your friendly lord .
Thus to have said , As you were fore advised , had touch’d his spirit And tried his inclination from him pluck’d Either his gracious promise , which you might , As cause had call’d you up , have held him to Or else it would have gall’d his surly nature , Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught so putting him to rage , You should have ta’en the advantage of his choler And pass’d him unelected .
And so am I for no woman .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you
If this be so , why blame you me to love you
As by lot , God wot , and then , you know , It came to pass , as most like it was The first row of the pious chanson will show you more , for look where my abridgement comes .
If this be so , why blame you me to love you
Why do you speak , too , Why blame you me to love you
You are welcome , masters , welcome , all I am glad to see thee well . Welcome , good friends . O old friend Why , thy face is valenced since I saw thee last . Comest thou to beard me in Denmark What , my young lady and mistress By r Lady , your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last , by the altitude of a chopine . Pray God , your voice , like a piece of uncurrent gold , be not cracked within the ring . Masters , you are all welcome . We’ll e en to ’t like French falconers , fly at any thing we see . We’ll have a speech straight . Come , give us a taste of your quality . Come , a passionate speech .
To her that is not here , nor doth not hear .
What speech , my good lord
Pray you , no more of this . Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon . As you love Phoebe , meet . And as I love no woman , I’ll meet . So fare you well . I have left you commands .
I heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was never acted . Or , if it was , not above once , for the play , I remember , pleased not the million . Twas caviary to the general . But it was as I received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .
I’ll not fail , if I live .
Nor I .
Nor I .
Retire We have engaged ourselves too far . Caesar himself has work , and our oppression Exceeds what we expected .
O my brave Emperor , this is fought indeed Had we done so at first , we had droven them home With clouts about their heads .
Thou bleed’st apace .
I had a wound here that was like a T , But now ’tis made an H .
They do retire .
We’ll beat ’em into bench holes . I have yet Room for six scotches more .
They are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves For a fair victory .
Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up , as we take hares , behind ’Tis sport to maul a runner .
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor . Come thee on .
Go , some of you , knock at the abbey gate , And bid the Lady Abbess come to me . I will determine this before I stir .
O mistress , mistress , shift and save yourself . My master and his man are both broke loose , Beaten the maids a row , and bound the doctor , Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire , And ever as it blazed , they threw on him Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair . My master preaches patience to him , and the while His man with scissors nicks him like a fool And sure , unless you send some present help , Between them they will kill the conjurer .
Peace , fool . Thy master and his man are here , And that is false thou dost report to us .
Mistress , upon my life I tell you true . I have not breathed almost since I did see it . He cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , To scorch your face and to disfigure you .
Hark , hark , I hear him , mistress . Fly , begone
Come , stand by me . Fear nothing . Guard with halberds .
Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves , and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you , When he hath power to crush Why , had your bodies No heart among you or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment
Have you Ere now denied the asker and now again Of him that did not ask , but mock , bestow Your sued for tongues
He’s not confirm’d we may deny him yet .
And will deny him I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound .
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece ’em .
Get you hence instantly , and tell those friends , They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so .
With divers liquors O , if this were seen , The happiest youth , viewing his progress through , What perils past , what crosses to ensue , Would shut the book , and sit him down and die . Tis not ten years gone Since Richard and Northumberland , great friends , Did feast together , and in two years after Were they at wars . It is but eight years since This Percy was the man nearest my soul , Who like a brother toiled in my affairs And laid his love and life under my foot , Yea , for my sake , even to the eyes of Richard Gave him defiance . But which of you was by You , cousin Nevil , as I may remember When Richard , with his eye brimful of tears , Then checked and rated by Northumberland , Did speak these words , now proved a prophecy Northumberland , thou ladder by the which My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne Though then , God knows , I had no such intent , But that necessity so bowed the state That I and greatness were compelled to kiss The time shall come , thus did he follow it , The time will come that foul sin , gathering head , Shall break into corruption so went on , Foretelling this same time’s condition And the division of our amity .
Let them assemble , And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election enforce his pride , And his old hate unto you besides , forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed , How in his suit he scorn’d you but your loves , Thinking upon his services , took from you The apprehension of his present portance , Which most gibingly , ungravely , he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you .
There is a history in all men’s lives Figuring the nature of the times deceased , The which observed , a man may prophesy , With a near aim , of the main chance of things As yet not come to life , which in their seeds And weak beginnings lie intreasurèd . Such things become the hatch and brood of time , And by the necessary form of this ,
trick up with new tuned oaths and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale washed wits is wonderful to be thought on . But you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvelously mistook .
I tell you what , Captain Gower . I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is . If I find a hole in his coat , I will tell him my mind .
Hark you , the king is coming , and I must speak with him from the pridge . God pless your Majesty .
How now , Fluellen , cam’st thou from the bridge
I’ll halt after .
Ay , so please your Majesty . The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge . The French is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages . Marry , th athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge . I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a prave man .
What men have you lost , Fluellen
The perdition of th athversary hath been very great , reasonable great . Marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , if your Majesty know the man . His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and his lips blows at his nose , and it is like a coal of fire , sometimes plue and sometimes red , but his nose is executed , and his fire’s out .
Tomorrow is the joyful day , Audrey . Tomorrow will we be married .
I do desire it with all my heart , and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages .
Well met , honest gentleman .
By my troth , well met . Come , sit , sit , and a song .
We are for you . Sit i th middle .
Shall we clap into ’t roundly , without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse , which are the only prologues to a bad voice
I faith , i faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
It was a lover and his lass , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonny no , That o er the green cornfield did pass In springtime , the only pretty ring time , When birds do sing , Hey ding a ding , ding . Sweet lovers love the spring . Between the acres of the rye ,
I remember , one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory , nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation , but called it an honest method , as wholesome as sweet , and by very much more handsome than fine . One speech in it I chiefly loved . Twas Aeneas tale to Dido and thereabout of it , especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter . If it live in your >memory , begin at this line Let me see , let me see The rugged Pyrrhus , like th Hyrcanian beast It is not so . It begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus , he whose sable arms , Black as his purpose , did the night resemble When he lay couchèd in the ominous horse , Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared With heraldry more dismal . Head to foot Now is he total gules , horridly tricked With blood of fathers , mothers , daughters , sons , Baked and impasted with the parching streets , That lend a tyrannous and damnèd light To their lord’s murder . Roasted in wrath and fire , And thus o ersizèd with coagulate gore , With eyes like carbuncles , the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks . So , proceed you .
Fore God , my lord , well spoken , with good accent and good discretion .
Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks . His antique sword , Rebellious to his arm , lies where it falls , Repugnant to command . Unequal matched , Pyrrhus at Priam drives , in rage strikes wide , But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls . Then senseless Ilium , Seeming to feel this blow , with flaming top Stoops to his base , and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear . For , lo , his sword , Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam , seemed i th air to stick . So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood ,
And I say the earth was not of my mind , If you suppose as fearing you it shook .
The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble .
O , then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire , And not in fear of your nativity . Diseas d nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions oft the teeming earth Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb , which , for enlargement striving , Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down Steeples and moss grown towers . At your birth Our grandam earth , having this distemperature , In passion shook .
Cousin , of many men I do not bear these crossings . Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , The goats ran from the mountains , and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields . These signs have marked me extraordinary , And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men . Where is he living , clipped in with the sea That chides the banks of England , Scotland , Wales , Which calls me pupil or hath read to me And bring him out that is but woman’s son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments .
I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh . I’ll to dinner .
We have beat him to his camp . Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests .
Tomorrow , Before the sun shall see ’s , we’ll spill the blood That has today escaped . I thank you all , For doughty handed are you , and have fought Not as you served the cause , but as ’t had been Each man’s like mine . You have shown all Hectors . Enter the city . Clip your wives , your friends . Tell them your feats , whilst they with joyful tears Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss The honored gashes whole .
Chain mine armed neck . Leap thou , attire and all , Through proof of harness to my heart , and there Ride on the pants triumphing
Lord of lords O infinite virtue , com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught
Lay A fault on us , your tribunes that we laboured , No impediment between , but that you must Cast your election on him .
Say , you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections , and that your minds , Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should , made you against the grain To voice him consul lay the fault on us .
Ay , spare us not . Say we read lectures to you . How youngly he began to serve his country , How long continued , and what stock he springs of , The noble house o’ the Marcians , from whence came That Ancus Martius , Numa’s daughter’s son , Who , after great Hostilius , here was king Of the same house Publius and Quintus were , That our beat water brought by conduits hither And censor , Was his great ancestor .
One thus descended , That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place , we did commend To your remembrances but you have found , Scaling his present bearing with his past , That he’s your fixed enemy , and revoke Your sudden approbation .
Ay me , it is my husband . Witness you That he is borne about invisible . Even now we housed him in the abbey here , And now he’s there , past thought of human reason .
Justice , most gracious duke , O , grant me justice , Even for the service that long since I did thee When I bestrid thee in the wars and took Deep scars to save thy life . Even for the blood That then I lost for thee , now grant me justice .
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote , I see my son Antipholus and Dromio .
Justice , sweet prince , against that woman there , She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife , That hath abusèd and dishonored me Even in the strength and height of injury . Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
Discover how , and thou shalt find me just .
This day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house .
A grievous fault . Say , woman , didst thou so
No , my good lord . Myself , he , and my sister Today did dine together . So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal .
Ne er may I look on day , nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth .
We would have all such offenders so cut off , and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .
You know me by my habit .
Well then , I know thee . What shall I know of thee
My master’s mind .
Unfold it .
Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England , though we seemed dead , we did but sleep . Advantage is a better soldier than rashness . Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe . Now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial . England shall repent his folly , see his
With a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonny no , These pretty country folks would lie In springtime , the only pretty ring time , When birds do sing , Hey ding a ding , ding . Sweet lovers love the spring . This carol they began that hour , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey hey nonny no , How that a life was but a flower In springtime , the only pretty ring time , When birds do sing , Hey ding a ding , ding . Sweet lovers love the spring . And therefore take the present time , With a hey , and a ho , and a hey hey nonny no , For love is crownèd with the prime In springtime , the only pretty ring time , When birds do sing , Hey ding a ding , ding . Sweet lovers love the spring .
Truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .
Peace , cousin Percy . You will make him mad .
I can call spirits from the vasty deep .
Why , so can I , or so can any man , But will they come when you do call for them
You are deceived , sir . We kept time . We lost not our time .
By my troth , yes . I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song . God be wi you , and God mend your voices . Come , Audrey .
Say , you ne’er had done’t Harp on that still but by our putting on And presently , when you have drawn your number , Repair to the Capitol . ALL We will so almost all Repent in their election .
Let them go on This mutiny were better put in hazard , Than stay , past doubt , for greater If , as his nature is , he fall in rage With their refusal , both observe and answer The vantage of his anger .
To the Capitol , come We will be there before the stream o’ the people And this shall seem , as partly ’tis , their own , Which we have goaded onward .
O perjured woman They are both forsworn . In this the madman justly chargeth them .
Why , I can teach you , cousin , to command the devil .
And I can teach thee , coz , to shame the devil By telling truth . Tell truth and shame the devil . If thou have power to raise him , bring him hither , And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence . O , while you live , tell truth and shame the devil
My liege , I am advisèd what I say , Neither disturbed with the effect of wine , Nor heady rash , provoked with raging ire , Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad . This woman locked me out this day from dinner . That goldsmith there , were he not packed with her , Could witness it , for he was with me then , Who parted with me to go fetch a chain , Promising to bring it to the Porpentine , Where Balthasar and I did dine together . Our dinner done and he not coming thither , I went to seek him . In the street I met him , And in his company that gentleman . There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain , Which , God he knows , I saw not for the which He did arrest me with an officer . I did obey , and sent my peasant home For certain ducats . He with none returned . Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house . By th way we met My wife , her sister , and a rabble more Of vile confederates . Along with them They brought one Pinch , a hungry , lean faced villain , A mere anatomy , a mountebank , A threadbare juggler , and a fortune teller , A needy , hollow eyed , sharp looking wretch , A living dead man . This pernicious slave , Forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , And , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,
Come , come , no more of this unprofitable chat .
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye And sandy bottomed Severn have I sent him Bootless home and weather beaten back .
Home without boots , and in foul weather too How ’scapes he agues , in the devil’s name
Come , here’s the map . Shall we divide our right According to our threefold order ta en
The Archdeacon hath divided it Into three limits very equally England , from Trent and Severn hitherto , By south and east is to my part assigned
Mine nightingale , We have beat them to their beds . What , girl , though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth . Behold this man . Commend unto his lips thy favoring hand . Kiss it , my warrior .
He hath fought today As if a god , in hate of mankind , had Destroyed in such a shape .
I’ll give thee , friend , An armor all of gold . It was a king’s .
He has deserved it , were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus’ car . Give me thy hand . Through Alexandria make a jolly march . Bear our hacked targets like the men that owe them . Had our great palace the capacity To camp this host , we all would sup together And drink carouses to the next day’s fate , Which promises royal peril . Trumpeters , With brazen din blast you the city’s ear Make mingle with our rattling taborins , That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together , Applauding our approach .
weakness , and admire our sufferance . Bid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under . For our losses , his exchequer is too poor for th effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction . To this , add defiance , and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced . So far my king and master so much my office .
What is thy name I know thy quality .
Montjoy .
Thou dost thy office fairly . Turn thee back , And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment , for , to say the sooth , Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage , My people are with sickness much enfeebled , My numbers lessened , and those few I have Almost no better than so many French , Who when they were in health , I tell thee , herald , I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen . Yet , forgive me , God , That I do brag thus . This your air of France Hath blown that vice in me . I must repent . Go therefore , tell thy master here I am . My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk , My army but a weak and sickly guard , Yet , God before , tell him we will come on Though France himself and such another neighbor Stand in our way . There’s for thy labor , Montjoy . Go bid thy master well advise himself If we may pass , we will if we be hindered , We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolor . And so , Montjoy , fare you well . The sum of all our answer is but this We would not seek a battle as we are , Nor , as we are , we say we will not shun it . So tell your master .
And , like a neutral to his will and matter , Did nothing . But as we often see against some storm A silence in the heavens , the rack stand still , The bold winds speechless , and the orb below As hush as death , anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region . So , after Pyrrhus pause , Arousèd vengeance sets him new a work . And never did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars’s armor forged for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falls on Priam . Out , out , thou strumpet Fortune All you gods In general synod take away her power , Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel , And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven , As low as to the fiends
This is too long .
It shall to the barber’s , with your beard . Prithee , say on . He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry , or he sleeps . Say on . Come to Hecuba .
But who , ah woe , who had seen the moblèd queen
The moblèd queen
King Richard might create a perfect guess That great Northumberland , then false to him , Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness , Which should not find a ground to root upon Unless on you .
Are these things then necessities Then let us meet them like necessities . And that same word even now cries out on us . They say the Bishop and Northumberland Are fifty thousand strong .
It cannot be , my lord . Rumor doth double , like the voice and echo , The numbers of the feared . Please it your Grace To go to bed . Upon my soul , my lord , The powers that you already have sent forth Shall bring this prize in very easily . To comfort you the more , I have received A certain instance that Glendower is dead . Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill , And these unseasoned hours perforce must add Unto your sickness .
I will take your counsel . And were these inward wars once out of hand , We would , dear lords , unto the Holy Land .
Dost thou believe , Orlando , that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd
I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not , As those that fear they hope , and know they fear .
You say , if I bring in your Rosalind , You will bestow her on Orlando here
That would I , had I kingdoms to give with her .
And you say you will have her when I bring her
That would I , were I of all kingdoms king .
You say you’ll marry me if I be willing
That will I , should I die the hour after .
But if you do refuse to marry me , You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head
He had , my lord and that it was which caused Our swifter composition .
So then the Volsces stand but as at first , Ready , when time shall prompt them , to make road . Upon’s again .
They are worn , lord consul , so , That we shall hardly in our ages see Their banners wave again .
Saw you Aufidius
On safe guard he came to me and did curse Against the Volsces , for they had so vilely Yielded the town he is retired to Antium .
Spoke he of me
He did , my lord .
How what
How often he had met you , sword to sword That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most , that he would pawn his fortunes To hopeless restitution , so he might Be call’d your vanquisher .
I shall deliver so . Thanks to your Highness .
I hope they will not come upon us now .
We are in God’s hand , brother , not in theirs . March to the bridge . It now draws toward night . Beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves , And on tomorrow bid them march away .
And with no face outfacing me , Cries out I was possessed . Then all together They fell upon me , bound me , bore me thence , And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man , both bound together , Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder , I gained my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace , whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities .
My lord , in truth , thus far I witness with him That he dined not at home , but was locked out .
But had he such a chain of thee or no
He had , my lord , and when he ran in here , These people saw the chain about his neck .
All westward , Wales beyond the Severn shore , And all the fertile land within that bound To Owen Glendower and , dear coz , to you The remnant northward , lying off from Trent . And our indentures tripartite are drawn , Which being sealèd interchangeably A business that this night may execute Tomorrow , cousin Percy , you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish power , As is appointed us , at Shrewsbury . My father Glendower is not ready yet , Not shall we need his help these fourteen days . Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants , friends , and neighboring gentlemen .
Besides , I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart , And thereupon I drew my sword on you , And then you fled into this abbey here , From whence I think you are come by miracle .
A shorter time shall send me to you , lords , And in my conduct shall your ladies come , From whom you now must steal and take no leave , For there will be a world of water shed Upon the parting of your wives and you .
I never came within these abbey walls , Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me . I never saw the chain , so help me heaven , And this is false you burden me withal .
Why , what an intricate impeach is this I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup . If here you housed him , here he would have been . If he were mad , he would not plead so coldly .
Methinks my moiety , north from Burton here , In quantity equals not one of yours . See how this river comes me cranking in And cuts me from the best of all my land A huge half moon , a monstrous cantle out . I’ll have the current in this place dammed up , And here the smug and silver Trent shall run In a new channel , fair and evenly . It shall not wind with such a deep indent , To rob me of so rich a bottom here .
So is the bargain .
You say that you’ll have Phoebe if she will
Though to have her and death were both one thing .
I have promised to make all this matter even . Keep you your word , O duke , to give your daughter , You yours , Orlando , to receive his daughter . Keep your word , Phoebe , that you’ll marry me Or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd . Keep your word , Silvius , that you’ll marry her If she refuse me . And from hence I go To make these doubts all even .
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor .
My lord , the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter . But , my good lord , this boy is forest born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle , Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest .
Not wind It shall , it must . You see it doth .
At Antium lives he
At Antium .
I wish I had a cause to seek him there , To oppose his hatred fully . Welcome home .
Behold , these are the tribunes of the people , The tongues o’ the common mouth I do despise them For they do prank them in authority , Against all noble sufferance .
Pass no further .
Ha what is that
It will be dangerous to go on no further .
What makes this change
The matter
Hath he not pass’d the noble and the common
Cominius , no .
Have I had children’s voices
Tribunes , give way he shall to the market place .
The people are incensed against him .
Stop , Or all will fall in broil .
Are these your herd Must these have voices , that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices You being their mouths , why rule you not their teeth Have you not set them on
If we be not relieved within this hour , We must return to th’ court of guard . The night Is shiny , and they say we shall embattle By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn .
This last day was a shrewd one to ’s .
O bear me witness , night
What man is this
Yea , but Mark how he bears his course , and runs me up With like advantage on the other side , Gelding the opposèd continent as much As on the other side it takes from you .
Yea , but a little charge will trench him here And on this north side win this cape of land , And then he runs straight and even .
I’ll have it so . A little charge will do it .
I’ll not have it altered .
Will not you
Come on , come on , come on . Give me your hand , sir , give me your hand , sir . An early stirrer , by the rood . And how doth my good cousin Silence
No , nor you shall not .
Good morrow , good cousin Shallow .
Who shall say me nay
And how doth my cousin your bedfellow And your fairest daughter and mine , my goddaughter Ellen
Why , that will I .
Alas , a black ousel , cousin Shallow .
Let me not understand you , then speak it in Welsh .
By yea and no , sir . I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar . He is at Oxford still , is he not
I can speak English , lord , as well as you , For I was trained up in the English court , Where being but young I framèd to the harp Many an English ditty lovely well And gave the tongue a helpful ornament A virtue that was never seen in you .
Indeed , sir , to my cost .
Marry , And I am glad of it with all my heart I had rather be a kitten and cry mew Than one of these same meter balladmongers .
He must then to the Inns o Court shortly . I was once of Clement’s Inn , where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet .
Stand close and list him .
You were called Lusty Shallow then , cousin .
Be witness to me , O thou blessèd moon , When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory , poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent .
By the Mass , I was called anything , and I would have done anything indeed too , and roundly too . There was I , and little John Doit of Staffordshire , and black George Barnes , and Francis Pickbone , and Will Squele , a Cotswold man . You had not four such swinge bucklers in all the Inns o Court
Enobarbus
Peace Hark further .
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy , The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me , That life , a very rebel to my will , May hang no longer on me . Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault , Which , being dried with grief , will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts . O Antony , Nobler than my revolt is infamous , Forgive me in thine own particular , But let the world rank me in register A master leaver and a fugitive . O Antony O Antony
That’s good . Moblèd queen is good .
Run barefoot up and down , threatening the flames With bisson rheum , a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood , and for a robe , About her lank and all o erteemèd loins , A blanket , in the alarm of fear caught up Who this had seen , with tongue in venom steeped , Gainst fortune’s state would treason have pronounced . But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs , The instant burst of clamor that she made , Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven , And passion in the gods .
There is sure another flood toward , and these couples are coming to the ark . Here comes a pair of very strange beasts , which in all tongues are called fools .
Look whe e he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes . Prithee , no more .
Salutation and greeting to you all .
Tut , I have the best armor of the world . Would it were day
Good my lord , will you see the players well bestowed Do you hear , let them be well used , for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time . After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live .
Good my lord , bid him welcome . This is the motley minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest . He hath been a courtier , he swears .
You have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .
My lord , I will use them according to their desert .
If any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation . I have trod a measure . I have flattered a lady . I have been politic with my friend , smooth with mine enemy . I have undone three tailors . I have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
It is the best horse of Europe .
Be calm , be calm .
God’s bodykins , man , much better . Use every man after his desert , and who should ’scape whipping Use them after your own honor and dignity . The less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty . Take them in .
And how was that ta en up
You say he dined at home the goldsmith here Denies that saying . Sirrah , what say you
It is a purposed thing , and grows by plot , To curb the will of the nobility Suffer’t , and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled .
Sir , he dined with her there , at the Porpentine .
Call’t not a plot The people cry you mock’d them , and of late , When corn was given them gratis , you repined Scandal’d the suppliants for the people , call’d them Time pleasers , flatterers , foes to nobleness .
He did , and from my finger snatched that ring .
Why , this was known before .
Not to them all .
Tis true , my liege this ring I had of her .
Have you inform’d them sithence
Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here
I had rather hear a brazen can’stick turned , Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree , And that would set my teeth nothing an edge , Nothing so much as mincing poetry . Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag .
How I inform them
Come , you shall have Trent turned .
You are like to do such business .
As sure , my liege , as I do see your Grace .
Not unlike , Each way , to better yours .
I do not care . I’ll give thrice so much land To any well deserving friend But in the way of bargain , mark you me , I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair . Are the indentures drawn Shall we be gone
Why , this is strange . Go call the Abbess hither . I think you are all mated or stark mad .
Why then should I be consul By yond clouds , Let me deserve so ill as you , and make me Your fellow tribune .
The moon shines fair . You may away by night . I’ll haste the writer , and withal Break with your wives of your departure hence . I am afraid my daughter will run mad , So much she doteth on her Mortimer .
You show too much of that For which the people stir if you will pass To where you are bound , you must inquire your way , Which you are out of , with a gentler spirit , Or never be so noble as a consul , Nor yoke with him for tribune .
Fie , cousin Percy , how you cross my father
Most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word . Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me .
Speak freely , Syracusian , what thou wilt .
I cannot choose . Sometime he angers me With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant , Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies , And of a dragon and a finless fish , A clip winged griffin and a moulten raven , A couching lion and a ramping cat , And such a deal of skimble skamble stuff As puts me from my faith . I tell you what He held me last night at least nine hours In reckoning up the several devils names That were his lackeys . I cried Hum , and Well , go to , But marked him not a word . O , he is as tedious
Is not your name , sir , called Antipholus And is not that your bondman Dromio
Within this hour I was his bondman sir , But he , I thank him , gnawed in two my cords . Now am I Dromio , and his man , unbound .
I am sure you both of you remember me .
Ourselves we do remember , sir , by you . For lately we were bound as you are now . You are not Pinch’s patient , are you , sir
Let’s speak to him .
Faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
Let’s hear him , for the things he speaks may concern Caesar .
How seventh cause Good my lord , like this fellow .
Let’s do so . But he sleeps .
I like him very well .
Swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep .
again . And I may say to you , we knew where the bona robas were and had the best of them all at commandment . Then was Jack Falstaff , now Sir John , a boy , and page to Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk .
This Sir John , cousin , that comes hither anon about soldiers
Go we to him .
Awake , sir , awake . Speak to us .
Hear you , sir
The hand of death hath raught him .
Hark , the drums Demurely wake the sleepers . Let us bear him To th’ court of guard . He is of note . Our hour Is fully out .
Come on , then . He may recover yet .
Will it never be morning
My lord of Orléans , and my Lord High Constable , you talk of horse and armor
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
What a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns . Çà ha He bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs , le cheval volant , the Pegasus , qui a les narines de feu . When I bestride him , I soar I am a hawk he trots the air . The earth sings when he touches it . The basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes .
He’s of the color of the nutmeg .
As a tired horse , a railing wife , Worse than a smoky house I had rather live With cheese and garlic in a windmill , far , Than feed on cates and have him talk to me In any summerhouse in Christendom .
And of the heat of the ginger . It is a beast for Perseus . He is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him , but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him . He is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .
In faith , he is a worthy gentleman , Exceedingly well read and profited In strange concealments , valiant as a lion , And as wondrous affable , and as bountiful As mines of India . Shall I tell you , cousin He holds your temper in a high respect And curbs himself even of his natural scope When you come cross his humor . Faith , he does . I warrant you that man is not alive Might so have tempted him as you have done Without the taste of danger and reproof . But do not use it oft , let me entreat you .
In faith , my lord , you are too willful blame , And , since your coming hither , have done enough To put him quite beside his patience . You must needs learn , lord , to amend this fault . Though sometimes it show greatness , courage , blood And that’s the dearest grace it renders you Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage , Defect of manners , want of government , Pride , haughtiness , opinion , and disdain , The least of which , haunting a nobleman , Loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain Upon the beauty of all parts besides , Beguiling them of commendation .
Well , I am schooled . Good manners be your speed Here come our wives , and let us take our leave .
Let’s be calm .
The people are abused set on . This paltering Becomes not Rome , nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour’d rub , laid falsely I’ the plain way of his merit .
Tell me of corn This was my speech , and I will speak’t again
Not now , not now .
Not in this heat , sir , now .
Now , as I live , I will . My nobler friends , I crave their pardons For the mutable , rank scented many , let them Regard me as I do not flatter , and Therein behold themselves I say again , In soothing them , we nourish ’gainst our senate The cockle of rebellion , insolence , sedition , Which we ourselves have plough’d for , sow’d , and scatter’d , By mingling them with us , the honour’d number , Who lack not virtue , no , nor power , but that Which they have given to beggars .
Well , no more .
No more words , we beseech you .
God ild you , sir . I desire you of the like . I press in here , sir , amongst the rest of the country copulatives , to swear and to forswear , according as marriage binds and blood breaks . A poor virgin , sir , an ill favored thing , sir , but mine own . A poor humor of mine , sir , to take that that no man else will . Rich honesty dwells like a miser , sir , in a poor house , as your pearl in your foul oyster .
By my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
According to the fool’s bolt , sir , and such dulcet diseases .
But for the seventh cause . How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause
Upon a lie seven times removed . Bear your body more seeming , Audrey . As thus , sir I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard . He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was . This is called the retort courteous . If I sent him word again it was not well cut , he would send me word he cut it to please himself . This is called the quip modest . If again it was not well cut , he disabled my judgment . This is called the reply churlish . If again it was not well cut , he would answer I spake not true . This is called the reproof valiant . If again it was not well cut , he would say I lie . This is called the countercheck quarrelsome , and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct .
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
Come , sirs .
Follow him , friends . We’ll hear a play tomorrow . Dost thou hear me , old friend Can you play The Murder of Gonzago
Ay , my lord .
We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night . You could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t , could you not
Ay , my lord .
Very well . Follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
My good friends , I’ll leave you till night . You are welcome to Elsinore .
Good my lord .
Ay , so . Good bye to you .
Now I am alone . Oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am I Is it not monstrous that this player here , But in a fiction , in a dream of passion , Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wanned , Tears in his eyes , distraction in his aspect , A broken voice , and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit And all for nothing For Hecuba What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech , Make mad the guilty and appall the free ,
The same Sir John , the very same . I see him break Scoggin’s head at the court gate , when he was a crack not thus high and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish , a fruiterer , behind Grey’s Inn . Jesu , Jesu , the mad days that I have spent And to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead .
We shall all follow , cousin .
Certain , ’tis certain very sure , very sure . Death , as the Psalmist saith , is certain to all . All shall die . How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford Fair
By my troth , cousin , I was not there .
Death is certain . Is old Dooble of your town living yet
Dead , sir .
Jesu , Jesu , dead He drew a good bow , and dead He shot a fine shoot . John o Gaunt loved him well , and betted much money on his head . Dead He would have clapped i th clout at twelve score , and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half , that it would have done a man’s heart good to see . How a score of ewes now
This is the deadly spite that angers me My wife can speak no English , I no Welsh .
My daughter weeps she’ll not part with you . She’ll be a soldier too , she’ll to the wars .
Good father , tell her that she and my aunt Percy Shall follow in your conduct speedily .
She is desperate here , a peevish self willed harlotry , One that no persuasion can do good upon .
I understand thy looks . That pretty Welsh Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens I am too perfect in , and but for shame In such a parley should I answer thee .
I understand thy kisses and thou mine , And that’s a feeling disputation But I will never be a truant , love , Till I have learned thy language for thy tongue Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penned , Sung by a fair queen in a summer’s bower , With ravishing division , to her lute .
How no more As for my country I have shed my blood , Not fearing outward force , so shall my lungs Coin words till their decay against those measles , Which we disdain should tatter us , yet sought The very way to catch them .
You speak o’ the people , As if you were a god to punish , not A man of their infirmity .
’Twere well We let the people know’t .
What , what his choler
Their preparation is today by sea . We please them not by land .
Choler Were I as patient as the midnight sleep , By Jove , ’twould be my mind
For both , my lord .
It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is , Not poison any further .
I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air , We’d fight there too . But this it is our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us . Order for sea is given They have put forth the haven , Where their appointment we may best discover And look on their endeavor .
Shall remain Hear you this Triton of the minnows mark you His absolute ‘shall’
’Twas from the canon .
‘Shall’ O good but most unwise patricians why , You grave but reckless senators , have you thus Given Hydra here to choose an officer , That with his peremptory ‘shall , ’ being but The horn and noise o’ the monster’s , wants not spirit To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch , And make your channel his If he have power Then vail your ignorance if none , awake Your dangerous lenity . If you are learn’d , Be not as common fools if you are not , Let them have cushions by you . You are plebeians , If they be senators and they are no less , When , both your voices blended , the great’st taste Most palates theirs . They choose their magistrate , And such a one as he , who puts his ‘shall , ’ His popular ‘shall’ against a graver bench Than ever frown in Greece . By Jove himself It makes the consuls base and my soul aches To know , when two authorities are up , Neither supreme , how soon confusion May enter ’twixt the gap of both and take The one by the other .
Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears . Yet I , A dull and muddy mettled rascal , peak Like John a dreams , unpregnant of my cause , And can say nothing no , not for a king , Upon whose property and most dear life A damned defeat was made . Am I a coward Who calls me villain Breaks my pate across Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face Tweaks me by the nose Gives me the lie i th throat As deep as to the lungs Who does me this Ha Swounds , I should take it , for it cannot be But I am pigeon livered and lack gall To make oppression bitter , or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave’s offal . Bloody , bawdy villain Remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain O vengeance Why , what an ass am I This is most brave , That I , the son of a dear father murdered , Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell , Must , like a whore , unpack my heart with words And fall a cursing like a very drab , A scullion Fie upon ’t , foh About , my brain . Hum , I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have , by the very cunning of the scene , Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaimed their malefactions . For murder , though it have no tongue , will speak With most miraculous organ . I’ll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle . I’ll observe his looks . I’ll tent him to the quick . If he do blench , I know my course . The spirit that I have seen
I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial , nor he durst not give me the lie direct , and so we measured swords and parted .
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
O sir , we quarrel in print , by the book , as you have books for good manners . I will name you the degrees the first , the retort courteous the second , the quip modest the third , the reply churlish the fourth , the reproof valiant the fifth , the countercheque quarrelsome the sixth , the lie with circumstance the seventh , the lie direct . All these you may avoid but the lie direct , and you may avoid that , too , with an if . I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel , but when the parties were met themselves , one of them thought but of an if , as If you said so , then I said so . And they shook hands and swore brothers . Your if is the only peacemaker much virtue in if .
Why look you strange on me you know me well .
Is not this a rare fellow , my lord He’s as good at anything and yet a fool .
He uses his folly like a stalking horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
I never saw you in my life till now .
O , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face . But tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice
Neither .
Dromio , nor thou
No , trust me , sir , nor I .
I am sure thou dost .
Ay , sir , but I am sure I do not , and whatsoever a man denies , you are now bound to believe him .
Not know my voice O time’s extremity , Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap consuming winter’s drizzled snow , And all the conduits of my blood froze up , Yet hath my night of life some memory , My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , My dull deaf ears a little use to hear . All these old witnesses I cannot err Tell me thou art my son Antipholus .
Indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .
It is the prince of palfreys . His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch , and his countenance enforces homage .
No more , cousin .
Nay , the man hath no wit that cannot , from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb , vary deserved praise on my palfrey . It is a theme as fluent as the sea . Turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all . Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him . I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus Wonder of nature
Thereafter as they be , a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds .
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress .
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .
Your mistress bears well .
Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress .
Nay , for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back .
So perhaps did yours .
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things , made even , Atone together .
Well , on to the market place .
Whoever gave that counsel , to give forth The corn o’ the storehouse gratis , as ’twas used Sometime in Greece ,
Well , well , no more of that .
Though there the people had more absolute power , I say , they nourish’d disobedience , fed The ruin of the state .
Why , shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice
And is old Dooble dead
I’ll give my reasons , More worthier than their voices . They know the corn Was not our recompense , resting well assured That ne’er did service for’t being press’d to the war , Even when the navel of the state was touch’d , They would not thread the gates . This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis . Being i’ the war Their mutinies and revolts , wherein they show’d Most valour , spoke not for them the accusation Which they have often made against the senate , All cause unborn , could never be the motive Of our so frank donation . Well , what then How shall this bisson multitude digest The senate’s courtesy Let deeds express What’s like to be their words ‘we did request it We are the greater poll , and in true fear They gave us our demands . ’ Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears which will in time Break ope the locks o’ the senate and bring in The crows to peck the eagles .
May be the devil , and the devil hath power T assume a pleasing shape . Yea , and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy , As he is very potent with such spirits , Abuses me to damn me . I’ll have grounds More relative than this . The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king .
Here come two of Sir John Falstaff’s men , as I think .
Good morrow , honest gentlemen .
I beseech you , which is Justice Shallow
I am Robert Shallow , sir , a poor esquire of this county and one of the King’s justices of the peace . What is your good pleasure with me
My captain , sir , commends him to you , my captain , Sir John Falstaff , a tall gentleman , by heaven , and a most gallant leader .
He greets me well , sir . I knew him a good backsword man . How doth the good knight May I ask how my lady his wife doth
Sir , pardon . A soldier is better accommodated than with a wife .
It is well said , in faith , sir , and it is well said indeed too . Better accommodated . It is good , yea , indeed , is it . Good phrases are surely , and ever were , very commendable .
But being charged , we will be still by land Which , as I take ’t , we shall , for his best force Is forth to man his galleys . To the vales , And hold our best advantage .
Good duke , receive thy daughter . Hymen from heaven brought her , Yea , brought her hither , That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is .
To you I give myself , for I am yours .
If there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
If there be truth in sight , you are my Rosalind .
If sight and shape be true , Why then , my love adieu .
Nor ne er wed woman , if you be not she .
Peace , ho I bar confusion . Tis I must make conclusion Of these most strange events . Here’s eight that must take hands To join in Hymen’s bands , If truth holds true contents . Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing , Feed yourselves with questioning , That reason wonder may diminish How thus we met , and these things finish .
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion , Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
He does confess he feels himself distracted . But from what cause he will by no means speak .
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded . But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state .
Did he receive you well
Most like a gentleman .
But with much forcing of his disposition .
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply .
Did you assay him To any pastime
Madam , it so fell out , that certain players We o erraught on the way . Of these we told him , And there did seem in him a kind of joy
Wedding is great Juno’s crown , O blessèd bond of board and bed . Tis Hymen peoples every town . High wedlock then be honorèd . Honor , high honor , and renown , To Hymen , god of every town .
O my dear niece , welcome thou art to me , Even daughter , welcome in no less degree .
I will not eat my word . Now thou art mine , Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine .
Let me have audience for a word or two . I am the second son of old Sir Rowland , That bring these tidings to this fair assembly . Duke Frederick , hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest , Addressed a mighty power , which were on foot In his own conduct , purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword . And to the skirts of this wild wood he came , Where , meeting with an old religious man , After some question with him , was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world , His crown bequeathing to his banished brother , And all their lands restored to them again That were with him exiled . This to be true I do engage my life .
Mine was not bridled .
Oh , then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of Ireland , your French hose off and in your straight strossers .
You have good judgment in horsemanship .
Be warned by me , then they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs . I had rather have my horse to my mistress .
I had as lief have my mistress a jade .
I tell thee , Constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress .
Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement , et la truie lavée au bourbier . Thou mak’st use of anything .
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
My Lord Constable , the armor that I saw in your tent tonight , are those stars or suns upon it
Stars , my lord .
Some of them will fall tomorrow , I hope .
Nay , if you melt , then will she run mad .
O , I am ignorance itself in this
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down And rest your gentle head upon her lap , And she will sing the song that pleaseth you And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep , Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness , Making such difference ’twixt wake and sleep As is the difference betwixt day and night The hour before the heavenly harnessed team Begins his golden progress in the east .
With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing . By that time will our book , I think , be drawn
Do so and those musicians that shall play to you Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence , And straight they shall be here . Sit , and attend .
Come , Kate , thou art perfect in lying down . Come , quick , quick , that I may lay my head in thy lap .
Go , you giddy goose .
Welcome , young man . Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers wedding To one his lands withheld , and to the other A land itself at large , a potent dukedom . First , in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot , And , after , every of this happy number That have endured shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returnèd fortune According to the measure of their states . Meantime , forget this new fall n dignity , And fall into our rustic revelry . Play , music . And you brides and bridegrooms all , With measure heaped in joy to th measures fall .
Come , enough .
Sir , by your patience if I heard you rightly , The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court .
Enough , with over measure .
He hath .
To him will I . Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned . You to a long and well deservèd bed .
No , take more What may be sworn by , both divine and human , Seal what I end withal This double worship , Where one part does disdain with cause , the other Insult without all reason , where gentry , title , wisdom , Cannot conclude but by the yea and no Of general ignorance , it must omit Real necessities , and give way the while To unstable slightne purpose so barr’d , it follows , Nothing is done to purpose . Therefore , beseech you , You that will be less fearful than discreet , That love the fundamental part of state More than you doubt the change on’t , that prefer A noble life before a long , and wish To jump a body with a dangerous physic That’s sure of death without it , at once pluck out The multitudinous tongue let them not lick The sweet which is their poison your dishonour Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should become’t , Not having the power to do the good it would , For the in which doth control’t .
To hear of it . They are about the court , And , as I think , they have already order This night to play before him .
Tis most true , And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter .
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined . Good gentlemen , give him a further edge , And drive his purpose on to these delights .
We shall , my lord .
Sweet Gertrude , leave us too , For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither , That he , as ’twere by accident , may here Affront Ophelia . Her father and myself Will so bestow ourselves that , seeing unseen , We may of their encounter frankly judge , And gather by him , as he is behaved , If ’t be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for .
I shall obey you . And for your part , Ophelia , I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet’s wildness . So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again , To both your honors .
Madam , I wish it may .
And you to wrangling , for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victualled . So to your pleasures . I am for other than for dancing measures .
Stay , Jaques , stay .
To see no pastime I . What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
Proceed , proceed . We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end , in true delights .
I never saw my father in my life .
But seven years since , in Syracusa , boy , Thou know’st we parted . But perhaps , my son , Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery .
The Duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so I ne er saw Syracusa in my life .
I tell thee , Syracusian , twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus , During which time he ne er saw Syracusa . I see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
Most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
I see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
And so , of these , which is the natural man And which the spirit Who deciphers them
I , sir , am Dromio . Command him away .
Ophelia , walk you here . Read on this book That show of such an exercise may color Your loneliness . We are oft to blame in this , Tis too much proved , that with devotion’s visage And pious action we do sugar o er The devil himself .
Oh , ’tis too true How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience The harlot’s cheek , beautied with plastering art , Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word . O heavy burden
I hear him coming . Let’s withdraw , my lord .
To be , or not to be That is the question Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , Or to take arms against a sea of troubles , And , by opposing , end them To die , to sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to ’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished To die , to sleep . To sleep , perchance to dream ay , there’s the rub , For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil , Must give us pause . There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life .
Has said enough .
Has spoken like a traitor , and shall answer As traitors do .
Thou wretch , despite o’erwhelm thee What should the people do with these bald tribunes On whom depending , their obedience fails To the greater bench in a rebellion , When what’s not meet , but what must be , was law , Then were they chosen in a better hour , Let what is meet be said it must be meet , And throw their power i’ the dust .
Manifest treason
This a consul no .
The aediles , ho
Let him be apprehended .
Yet they are not joined . Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all . I’ll bring thee word Straight how ’tis like to go .
Swallows have built In Cleopatra’s sails their nests . The auguries Say they know not , they cannot tell , look grimly , And dare not speak their knowledge . Antony Is valiant and dejected , and by starts His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear Of what he has and has not .
All is lost This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me . My fleet hath yielded to the foe , and yonder They cast their caps up and carouse together Like friends long lost . Triple turned whore ’Tis thou Hast sold me to this novice , and my heart Makes only wars on thee . Bid them all fly , For when I am revenged upon my charm , I have done all . Bid them all fly . Begone
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh , And ’tis no marvel he is so humorous . By r Lady , he is a good musician .
Then should you be nothing but musical , for you are altogether governed by humors . Lie still , you thief , and hear the lady sing in Welsh .
Go , call the people
I had rather hear Lady , my brach , howl in Irish .
And yet my sky shall not want .
That may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and ’twere more honor some were away .
Ev n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted .
Accommodated . It comes of accommodo . Very good , a good phrase .
Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile , and my way shall be paved with English faces .
I will not say so , for fear I should be faced out of my way . But I would it were morning , for I would fain be about the ears of the English .
Pardon , sir I have heard the word phrase call you it By this day , I know not the phrase , but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldierlike word , and a word of exceeding good command , by heaven . Accommodated , that is when a man is , as they say , accommodated , or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be accommodated , which is an excellent thing .
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them .
It is very just . Look , here comes good Sir John . Give me your good hand , give me your Worship’s good hand . By my troth , you like well and bear your years very well . Welcome , good Sir John .
I am glad to see you well , good Master Robert Shallow . Master Sure card , as I think
No , Sir John . It is my cousin Silence , in commission with me .
Good Master Silence , it well befits you should be of the peace .
Your good Worship is welcome .
Fie , this is hot weather , gentlemen . Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men
Marry , have we , sir . Will you sit
in whose name myself Attach thee as a traitorous innovator , A foe to the public weal obey , I charge thee , And follow to thine answer .
Hence , old goat
O sun , thy uprise shall I see no more . Fortune and Antony part here . Even here Do we shake hands . All come to this The hearts That spanieled me at heels , to whom I gave Their wishes , do discandy , melt their sweets On blossoming Caesar , and this pine is barked That overtopped them all . Betrayed I am . Oh , this false soul of Egypt This grave charm , Whose eye becked forth my wars and called them home , Whose bosom was my crownet , my chief end , Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose Beguiled me to the very heart of loss . What , Eros , Eros
Ah , thou spell Avaunt
Why is my lord enraged against his love
Vanish , or I shall give thee thy deserving , And blemish Caesar’s triumph . Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians Follow his chariot , like the greatest spot Of all thy sex . Most monsterlike be shown For poor’st diminutives , for dolts , and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her preparèd nails
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , Th oppressor’s wrong , the proud man’s contumely , The pangs of despised love , the law’s delay , The insolence of office , and the spurns That patient merit of th unworthy takes , When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin Who would fardels bear , To grunt and sweat under a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns , puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience does make cowards of us all , And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought , And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action . Soft you now , The fair Ophelia Nymph , in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered .
Good my lord , How does your honor for this many a day
Wouldst thou have thy head broken
I humbly thank you . Well , well , well .
No .
My lord , I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver . I pray you now receive them .
Then be still .
No , not I . I never gave you aught .
Neither ’tis a woman’s fault .
My honored lord , you know right well you did , And with them , words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich . Their perfume lost ,
Now God help thee
To the Welsh lady’s bed .
What’s that
Peace , she sings .
Come , Kate , I’ll have your song too .
Not mine , in good sooth .
I , sir , am Dromio . Please , let me stay .
Egeon art thou not , or else his ghost
O , my old master . Who hath bound him here
Whoever bound him , I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty . Speak , old Egeon , if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia , That bore thee at a burden two fair sons . O , if thou be’st the same Egeon , speak , And speak unto the same Emilia .
Why , here begins his morning story right These two Antipholuses , these two so like , And these two Dromios , one in semblance Besides her urging of her wreck at sea These are the parents to these children , Which accidentally are met together .
If I dream not , thou art Emilia . If thou art she , tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft
By men of Epidamnum he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them And me they left with those of Epidamnum . What then became of them I cannot tell I to this fortune that you see me in .
Antipholus , thou cam’st from Corinth first .
’Tis well th’art gone , If it be well to live , but better ’twere Thou fell’st into my fury , for one death Might have prevented many . Eros , ho The shirt of Nessus is upon me . Teach me , Alcides , thou mine ancestor , thy rage . Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o’ th’ moon , And with those hands that grasped the heaviest club Subdue my worthiest self . The witch shall die . To the young Roman boy she hath sold me , and I fall Under this plot . She dies for ’t . Eros , ho
Tis midnight . I’ll go arm myself .
The Dauphin longs for morning .
He longs to eat the English .
I think he will eat all he kills .
By the white hand of my lady , he’s a gallant prince .
Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
He is simply the most active gentleman of France .
Doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
He never did harm that I heard of .
Nor will do none tomorrow . He will keep that good name still .
Help me , my women Oh , he’s more mad Than Telamon for his shield . The boar of Thessaly Was never so embossed .
I know him to be valiant .
To th’ monument There lock yourself and send him word you are dead . The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off .
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue , but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue . If it be true that good wine needs no bush , ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue . Yet to good wine they do use good bushes , and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues . What a case am I in , then , that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play . I am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me . My way is to conjure you , and I’ll begin with the women . I charge you , O women , for the love you bear to men , to like as much of this play as please you . And I charge you , O men , for the love you bear to women as I perceive by your simpering , none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please . If I were a woman , I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me , complexions that liked me , and breaths that I defied not . And I am sure as many as have good beards , or good faces , or sweet breaths will , for my kind offer , when I make curtsy , bid me farewell .
I was told that by one that knows him better than you .
What’s he
To th’ monument Mardian , go tell him I have slain myself . Say that the last I spoke was Antony , And word it , prithee , piteously . Hence , Mardian , And bring me how he takes my death . To th’ monument
Marry , he told me so himself and he said he cared not who knew it .
He needs not . It is no hidden virtue in him .
Take these again , for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind . There , my lord .
Ha , ha , are you honest
My lord
Let me see them , I beseech you .
Are you fair
What means your lordship
Where’s the roll Where’s the roll Where’s the roll Let me see , let me see , let me see . So , so , so , so , so . So , so . Yea , marry , sir . Rafe Mouldy Let them appear as I call , let them do so , let them do so . Let me see , where is Mouldy
That if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
Here , an it please you .
Could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty
What think you , Sir John A good limbed fellow young , strong , and of good friends .
Is thy name Mouldy
Ay , truly , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness . This was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof . I did love you once .
Yea , an ’t please you .
Indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
Tis the more time thou wert used .
You should not have believed me , for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it . I loved you not .
I was the more deceived .
Ha , ha , ha , most excellent , i faith Things that are mouldy lack use . Very singular good , in faith . Well said , Sir John , very well said .
Prick him .
Get thee to a nunnery . Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest , but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me .
I was pricked well enough before , an you could have let me alone . My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery . You need not to have pricked me . There are other men fitter to go out than I .
Go to . Peace , Mouldy . You shall go . Mouldy , it is time you were spent .
Eros , thou yet behold’st me
Ay , noble lord .
Sometimes we see a cloud that’s dragonish , A vapor sometime like a bear or lion , A towered citadel , a pendant rock , A forkèd mountain , or blue promontory With trees upon ’t that nod unto the world And mock our eyes with air . Thou hast seen these signs . They are black vesper’s pageants .
Ay , my lord .
That which is now a horse , even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water .
It does , my lord .
My good knave Eros , now thy captain is Even such a body . Here I am Antony , Yet cannot hold this visible shape , my knave . I made these wars for Egypt , and the Queen , Whose heart I thought I had , for she had mine Which whilst it was mine had annexed unto ’t A million more , now lost she , Eros , has Packed cards with Caesar and false played my glory Unto an enemy’s triumph . Nay , weep not , gentle Eros . There is left us Ourselves to end ourselves .
Oh , thy vile lady She has robbed me of my sword .
No , Antony , My mistress loved thee , and her fortunes mingled With thine entirely .
Hence , saucy eunuch Peace She hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
Death of one person can be paid but once , And that she has discharged . What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand . The last she spake Was Antony , most noble Antony Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony . It was divided Between her heart and lips . She rendered life , Thy name so buried in her .
Dead , then
Dead .
Unarm , Eros . The long day’s task is done , And we must sleep . That thou depart’st hence safe Does pay thy labor richly . Go .
Off , pluck off The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart . O , cleave , my sides Heart , once be stronger than thy continent . Crack thy frail case Apace , Eros , apace . No more a soldier . Bruisèd pieces , go . You have been nobly borne . From me awhile .
I am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in . What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves , all . Believe none of us . Go thy ways to a nunnery . Where’s your father
At home , my lord .
Let the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house . Farewell .
O , help him , you sweet heavens
If thou dost marry , I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry . Be thou as chaste as ice , as pure as snow , thou shalt not escape calumny . Get thee to a nunnery , go . Farewell . Or , if thou wilt needs marry , marry a fool , for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them . To a nunnery , go , and quickly too . Farewell .
Heavenly powers , restore him
I have heard of your paintings too , well enough . God has given you one face and you make yourselves another . You jig and amble , and you lisp , you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance . Go to , I’ll no more on ’t . It hath made me mad . I say , we will have no more marriages . Those that are married already , all but one , shall live . The rest shall keep as they are . To a nunnery , go .
By my faith , sir , but it is never anybody saw it but his lackey . Tis a hooded valor , and when it appears , it will bate .
Ill will never said well .
I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in friendship .
And I will take up that with Give the devil his due .
Not yours , in good sooth Heart , you swear like a comfit maker’s wife Not you , in good sooth , and as true as I live , and as God shall mend me , and as sure as day And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths As if thou never walk’st further than Finsbury . Swear me , Kate , like a lady as thou art , A good mouth filling oath , and leave in sooth , And such protest of pepper gingerbread , To velvet guards and Sunday citizens . Come , sing .
Well placed there stands your friend for the devil . Have at the very eye of that proverb with A pox of the devil .
I will not sing .
You are the better at proverbs , by how much A fool’s bolt is soon shot .
Tis the next way to turn tailor , or be red breast teacher . An the indentures be drawn , I’ll away within these two hours , and so come in when ye will .
You have shot over .
Tis not the first time you were overshot .
Come , come , Lord Mortimer you are as slow As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go . By this our book is drawn . We’ll but seal , And then to horse immediately .
Spent
With all my heart .
Peace , fellow , peace . Stand aside . Know you where you are For th other , Sir John . Let me see . Simon Shadow
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
Yea , marry , let me have him to sit under . He’s like to be a cold soldier .
Who hath measured the ground
Where’s Shadow
The Lord Grandpré .
Here , sir .
A valiant and most expert gentleman . Would it were day Alas , poor Harry of England He longs not for the dawning as we do .
Shadow , whose son art thou
My mother’s son , sir .
Thy mother’s son Like enough , and thy father’s shadow . So the son of the female is the shadow of the male . It is often so , indeed , but much of the father’s substance .
Do you like him , Sir John
Shadow will serve for summer . Prick him , for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster book .
Thomas Wart
I will o’ertake thee , Cleopatra , and Weep for my pardon . So it must be , for now All length is torture . Since the torch is out , Lie down and stray no farther . Now all labor Mars what it does . Yea , very force entangles Itself with strength . Seal then , and all is done . Eros I come , my Queen . Eros Stay for me . Where souls do couch on flowers , we’ll hand in hand , And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze . Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops , And all the haunt be ours . Come , Eros , Eros
Where’s he
Here , sir .
What would my lord
Is thy name Wart
Hence Home , you idle creatures get you home Is this a holiday What , know you not , Being mechanical , you ought not walk Upon a laboring day without the sign Of your profession Speak , what trade art thou
Why , sir , a carpenter .
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness . I , that with my sword Quartered the world , and o’er green Neptune’s back With ships made cities , condemn myself to lack The courage of a woman less noble mind Than she which by her death our Caesar tells I am conqueror of myself . Thou art sworn , Eros , That when the exigent should come which now Is come indeed , when I should see behind me Th’ inevitable prosecution of Disgrace and horror , that on my command , Thou then wouldst kill me . Do ’t . The time is come . Thou strik’st not me , ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st . Put color in thy cheek .
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule What dost thou with thy best apparel on You , sir , what trade are you
Truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , I am but , as you would say , a cobbler .
But what trade art thou Answer me directly .
A trade , sir , that I hope I may use with a safe conscience , which is , indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .
What trade , thou knave Thou naughty knave , what trade
Nay , I beseech you , sir , be not out with me . Yet , if you be out , sir , I can mend you .
What mean’st thou by that Mend me , thou saucy fellow
No , sir , not I . I came from Syracuse .
Stay , stand apart . I know not which is which .
I came from Corinth , my most gracious lord .
And I with him .
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon , your most renownèd uncle .
Which of you two did dine with me today
I , gentle mistress .
And are not you my husband
No , I say nay to that .
And so do I , yet did she call me so , And this fair gentlewoman , her sister here , Did call me brother . What I told you then I hope I shall have leisure to make good , If this be not a dream I see and hear .
That is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
We’ll surety him .
I think it be , sir . I deny it not .
Aged sir , hands off .
And you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
I think I did , sir . I deny it not .
Hence , rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones Out of thy garments .
Help , ye citizens
On both sides more respect .
Here’s he that would take from you all your power .
Seize him , Aediles
Down with him down with him
Weapons , weapons , weapons
Tribunes Patricians Citizens What , ho Sicinius Brutus Coriolanus Citizens ‘Peace , peace , peace ’ ‘Stay , hold , peace ’
What is about to be I am out of breath Confusion’s near I cannot speak . You , tribunes To the people Coriolanus , patience Speak , good Sicinius .
Hear me , people peace
Let’s hear our tribune peace Speak , speak , speak .
The gods withhold me Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts , Though enemy , lost aim and could not
Eros , Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms , bending down His corrigible neck , his face subdued To penetrative shame , whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar , drawn before him , branded His baseness that ensued
I would not see ’t .
Come , then , for with a wound I must be cured . Draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country .
O sir , pardon me
You are at point to lose your liberties Martius would have all from you Martius , Whom late you have named for consul .
When I did make thee free , swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee Do it at once , Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed . Draw and come .
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
Lo thee
Why , sir , cobble you .
Thou art a cobbler , art thou
Truly , sir , all that I live by is with the awl . I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters , but withal I am indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes . When they are in great danger , I recover them . As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork .
But wherefore art not in thy shop today Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
Truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work . But indeed , sir , we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph .
Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels You blocks , you stones , you worse than senseless things , O you hard hearts , you cruèl men of Rome , Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft Have you climbed up to walls and battlements , To towers and windows , yea , to chimney tops , Your infants in your arms , and there have sat The livelong day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome . And when you saw his chariot but appear , Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores And do you now put on your best attire And do you now cull out a holiday
Oh , what a noble mind is here o erthrown The courtier’s , soldier’s , scholar’s , eye , tongue , sword , Th expectancy and rose of the fair state , The glass of fashion and the mould of form , Th observed of all observers , quite , quite down And I , of ladies most deject and wretched , That sucked the honey of his music vows , Now see that noble and most sovereign reason Like sweet bells jangled , out of tune and harsh That unmatched form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy . Oh , woe is me , T have seen what I have seen , see what I see
Love His affections do not that way tend . Nor what he spake , though it lacked form a little , Was not like madness . There’s something in his soul O er which his melancholy sits on brood , And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger which for to prevent , I have in quick determination Thus set it down he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute . Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something settled matter in his heart , Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself . What think you on ’t
It shall do well . But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love . How now , Ophelia You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
My sword is drawn .
Then let it do at once The thing why thou hast drawn it .
My dear master , My captain , and my emperor , let me say , Before I strike this bloody stroke , farewell .
’Tis said , man , and farewell .
Farewell , great chief . Shall I strike now
Now , Eros .
Why , there then
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death .
Thrice nobler than myself , Thou teachest me , O valiant Eros , what I should and thou couldst not . My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record . But I will be A bridegroom in my death , and run into ’t As to a lover’s bed . Come then , and Eros , Thy master dies thy scholar . To do thus I learned of thee .
Yea , sir .
Thou art a very ragged wart .
Shall I prick him down , Sir John
It were superfluous , for his apparel is built upon his back , and the whole frame stands upon pins . Prick him no more .
Ha , ha , ha . You can do it , sir , you can do it . I commend you well . Francis Feeble
Here , sir .
What trade art thou , Feeble
A woman’s tailor , sir .
Shall I prick him , sir
You may , but if he had been a man’s tailor , he’d ha pricked you . Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat
I will do my good will , sir . You can have no more .
Well said , good woman’s tailor , well said , courageous Feeble . Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse . Prick the woman’s tailor well , Master Shallow , deep , Master Shallow .
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood Be gone Run to your houses , fall upon your knees , Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude .
Go , go , good countrymen , and for this fault , Assemble all the poor men of your sort , Draw them to Tiber banks , and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all .
See whether their basest metal be not moved . They vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness . Go you down that way towards the Capitol . This way will I . Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies .
May we do so You know it is the feast of Lupercal .
It is no matter . Let no images Be hung with Caesar’s trophies . I’ll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets . So do you too , where you perceive them thick . These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch , Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness .
How Not dead Not dead The guard , ho Oh , dispatch me
What’s the noise
I have done my work ill , friends . Oh , make an end Of what I have begun
The star is fall’n .
And time is at his period .
Alas , and woe
Let him that loves me strike me dead .
Not I .
Nor I .
Nor anyone .
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly .
This sword but shown to Caesar , with this tidings , Shall enter me with him .
Where’s Antony
There , Diomed , there .
Lives he Wilt thou not answer , man
Calphurnia
Peace , ho Caesar speaks .
Calphurnia
Here , my lord .
We heard it all . My lord , do as you please . But , if you hold it fit , after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief . Let her be round with him , And I’ll be placed , so please you , in the ear Of all their conference . If she find him not , To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think .
Stand you directly in Antonius way When he doth run his course . Antonius
It shall be so . Madness in great ones must not unwatched go .
Caesar , my lord .
Forget not in your speed , Antonius , To touch Calphurnia , for our elders say The barren , touchèd in this holy chase , Shake off their sterile curse .
I shall remember . When Caesar says , do this , it is performed .
Set on , and leave no ceremony out .
Caesar
Art thou there , Diomed Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death .
Most absolute lord , My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee .
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of England to mope with his fat brained followers so far out of his knowledge .
When did she send thee
If the English had any apprehension , they would run away .
Now , my lord .
Where is she
That they lack , for if their heads had any intellectual armor , they could never wear such heavy head pieces .
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures . Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .
Locked in her monument . She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass . For when she saw Which never shall be found you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar , and that your rage Would not be purged , she sent you word she was dead . But fearing since how it might work , hath sent Me to proclaim the truth , and I am come , I dread , too late .
Foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples . You may as well say , that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .
Too late , good Diomed . Call my guard , I prithee .
Just , just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives . And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
What ho , the Emperor’s guard The guard , what ho Come , your lord calls
Ay , but these English are shrewdly out of beef .
Bear me , good friends , where Cleopatra bides . ’Tis the last service that I shall command you .
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight . Now is it time to arm . Come , shall we about it
It is now two o clock . But , let me see , by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen .
Woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear All your true followers out .
I sent you money , sir , to be your bail By Dromio , but I think he brought it not .
No , none by me .
Fie , fie , fie This is the way to kindle , not to quench .
This purse of ducats I received from you , And Dromio my man did bring them me . I see we still did meet each other’s man , And I was ta en for him , and he for me , And thereupon these errors are arose .
I would Wart might have gone , sir .
These ducats pawn I for my father here .
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat .
I would thou wert a man’s tailor , that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go . I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands . Let that suffice , most forcible Feeble .
It shall not need . Thy father hath his life .
What is the city but the people
It shall suffice , sir .
Sir , I must have that diamond from you .
I am bound to thee , reverend Feeble . Who is next
There , take it and much thanks for my good cheer .
True , The people are the city .
Peter Bullcalf o th green .
Yea , marry , let’s see Bullcalf .
By the consent of all , we were establish’d The people’s magistrates .
Renownèd duke , vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes , And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathizèd one day’s error Have suffered wrong . Go , keep us company , And we shall make full satisfaction . Thirty three years have I but gone in travail Of you , my sons , and till this present hour My heavy burden ne er deliverèd . The Duke , my husband , and my children both , And you , the calendars of their nativity , Go to a gossips feast , and go with me . After so long grief , such nativity
Here , sir .
With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast .
Fore God , a likely fellow . Come , prick me Bullcalf till he roar again .
O Lord , good my lord captain
What , dost thou roar before thou art pricked
O Lord , sir , I am a diseased man .
What disease hast thou
A whoreson cold , sir , a cough , sir , which I caught with ringing in the King’s affairs upon his coronation day , sir .
Come , thou shalt go to the wars in a gown . We will have away thy cold , and I will take such order that my friends shall ring for thee . Is here all
Most heavy day
You so remain .
Nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows . Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us , and we punish it , Seeming to bear it lightly . Take me up . I have led you oft carry me now , good friends , And have my thanks for all .
And so are like to do .
That is the way to lay the city flat To bring the roof to the foundation , And bury all , which yet distinctly ranges , In heaps and piles of ruin .
This deserves death .
Or let us stand to our authority , Or let us lose it . We do here pronounce , Upon the part o’ the people , in whose power We were elected theirs , Martius is worthy Of present death .
Ha Who calls
Therefore lay hold of him Bear him to the rock Tarpeian , and from thence Into destruction cast him .
Bid every noise be still . Peace yet again .
Who is it in the press that calls on me I hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , Cry Caesar Speak . Caesar is turned to hear .
Beware the ides of March .
What man is that
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March .
Set him before me . Let me see his face .
Fellow , come from the throng . Look upon Caesar .
What sayst thou to me now Speak once again .
Beware the ides of March .
He is a dreamer . Let us leave him . Pass
Will you go see the order of the course
Lords , give us leave the Prince of Wales and I Must have some private conference , but be near at hand , For we shall presently have need of you .
I know not whether God will have it so For some displeasing service I have done , That , in his secret doom , out of my blood He’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me . But thou dost in thy passages of life Make me believe that thou art only marked For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven To punish my mistreadings . Tell me else , Could such inordinate and low desires , Such poor , such bare , such lewd , such mean attempts , Such barren pleasures , rude society As thou art matched withal , and grafted to , Accompany the greatness of thy blood , And hold their level with thy princely heart
So please your Majesty , I would I could Quit all offenses with as clear excuse As well as I am doubtless I can purge Myself of many I am charged withal . Yet such extenuation let me beg As , in reproof of many tales devised , Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear , By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers , I may for some things true , wherein my youth Hath faulty wandered and irregular , Find pardon on my true submission .
O Charmian , I will never go from hence .
Be comforted , dear madam .
No , I will not . All strange and terrible events are welcome , But comforts we despise . Our size of sorrow , Proportioned to our cause , must be as great As that which makes it .
Speak the speech , I pray you , as I pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue . But if you mouth it , as many of your players do , I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines . Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus , but use all gently , for in the very torrent , tempest , and whirlwind of passion , you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness . Oh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise . I would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing Termagant . It out Herods Herod . Pray you , avoid it .
How now Is he dead
I warrant your honor .
His death’s upon him , but not dead . Look out o’ th’ other side your monument . His guard have brought him thither .
Be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor . Suit the action to the word , the word to the action , with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature . For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing , whose end , both at the first and now , was and is to hold , as ’twere , the mirror up to nature , to show virtue her own feature , scorn her own image , and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure . Now this overdone or come tardy off , though it make the unskillful laugh , cannot but make the judicious grieve , the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others .
O sun , Burn the great sphere thou mov’st in . Darkling stand The varying shore o’ th’ world O Antony , Antony , Antony Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help Help , friends below Let’s draw him hither .
Peace Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony , But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself .
So it should be , that none but Antony Should conquer Antony , but woe ’tis so
Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe . From camp to camp , through the foul womb of night , The hum of either army stilly sounds , That the fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other’s watch . Fire answers fire , and through their paly flames Each battle sees the other’s umbered face . Steed threatens steed , in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night’s dull ear and from the tents The armorers , accomplishing the knights , With busy hammers closing rivets up , Give dreadful note of preparation . The country cocks do crow , the clocks do toll , And , the third hour of drowsy morning named , Proud of their numbers and secure in soul , The confident and overlusty French Do the low rated English play at dice And chide the cripple , tardy gaited night , Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away . The poor condemnèd English , Like sacrifices , by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The morning’s danger and their gesture sad , Investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats , Presenteth them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts . Oh , now , who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band
Not I .
I pray you , do .
I am not gamesome . I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony . Let me not hinder , Cassius , your desires . I’ll leave you .
Brutus , I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have . You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you .
Cassius , Be not deceived . If I have veiled my look , I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself . Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference , Conceptions only proper to myself , Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors . But let not therefore , my good friends , be grieved Among which number , Cassius , be you one Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus , with himself at war , Forgets the shows of love to other men .
Then , Brutus , I have much mistook your passion , By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value , worthy cogitations . Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face
No , Cassius , for the eye sees not itself But by reflection , by some other things .
I am dying , Egypt , dying . Only I here importune death awhile , until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips .
I dare not , dear , Dear my lord , pardon , I dare not , Lest I be taken . Not th’ imperious show Of the full fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me . If knife , drugs , serpents , have Edge , sting , or operation , I am safe . Your wife Octavia , with her modest eyes And still conclusion , shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me . But come , come , Antony Help me , my women We must draw thee up . Assist , good friends .
Oh , quick , or I am gone .
Here’s sport indeed How heavy weighs my lord Our strength is all gone into heaviness , That makes the weight . Had I great Juno’s power , The strong winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side . Yet come a little . Wishers were ever fools . Oh , come , come , come
Here is two more called than your number . You must have but four here , sir , and so I pray you go in with me to dinner .
Come , I will go drink with you , but I cannot tarry dinner . I am glad to see you , by my troth , Master Shallow .
O , Sir John , do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George’s Field
No more of that , good Master Shallow , no more of that .
Ha , ’twas a merry night . And is Jane Nightwork alive
She lives , Master Shallow .
She never could away with me .
Never , never she would always say she could not abide Master Shallow .
By the Mass , I could anger her to th heart . She was then a bona roba . Doth she hold her own well
Old , old , Master Shallow .
Nay , she must be old . She cannot choose but be old . Certain , she’s old , and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement’s Inn .
That’s fifty five year ago .
And welcome , welcome Die when thou hast lived . Quicken with kissing . Had my lips that power , Thus would I wear them out .
A heavy sight
I am dying , Egypt , dying . Give me some wine and let me speak a little .
No , let me speak , and let me rail so high That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel , Provoked by my offense .
One word , sweet Queen Of Caesar seek your honor , with your safety Oh
They do not go together .
Gentle , hear me . None about Caesar trust but Proculeius .
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust , None about Caesar .
The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at , but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes , Wherein I lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world , The noblest , and do now not basely die , Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquished . Now my spirit is going . I can no more .
Master , shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard
Oh , there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise , not to speak it profanely , that , neither having th accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian , pagan , nor man , have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well , they imitated humanity so abominably .
Dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
Your goods that lay at host , sir , in the Centaur .
O , reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered . That’s villainous , and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it . Go , make you ready .
He speaks to me . I am your master , Dromio . Come , go with us . We’ll look to that anon . Embrace thy brother there . Rejoice with him .
How now , my lord Will the king hear this piece of work
There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner . She now shall be my sister , not my wife .
And the queen too , and that presently .
Methinks you are my glass , and not my brother I see by you I am a sweet faced youth . Will you walk in to see their gossiping
Bid the players make haste .
Not I , sir . You are my elder .
That’s a question . How shall we try it
Will you two help to hasten them
We’ll draw cuts for the signior . Till then , lead thou first .
Ay , my lord .
Nay , then , thus We came into the world like brother and brother , And now let’s go hand in hand , not one before another .
What ho , Horatio
Walking from watch to watch , from tent to tent Let him cry , Praise and glory on his head For forth he goes and visits all his host , Bids them good morrow with a modest smile , And calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen . Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him , Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all watchèd night , But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , That every wretch , pining and pale before , Beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks . A largess universal , like the sun , His liberal eye doth give to everyone , Thawing cold fear , that mean and gentle all Behold , as may unworthiness define , A little touch of Harry in the night . And so our scene must to the battle fly , Where , Oh , for pity , we shall much disgrace , With four or five most vile and ragged foils Right ill disposed in brawl ridiculous , The name of Agincourt . Yet sit and see , Minding true things by what their mock ries be .
Noblest of men , woo’t die Hast thou no care of me Shall I abide In this dull world , which in thy absence is No better than a sty O see , my women , The crown o’ th’ earth doth melt . My lord
Aediles , seize him
Oh , withered is the garland of the war . The soldier’s pole is fall’n Young boys and girls Are level now with men . The odds is gone , And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon .
Yield , Martius , yield
Oh , quietness , lady
She’s dead too , our sovereign .
Lady
Madam
O madam , madam , madam
Tis just . And it is very much lamented , Brutus , That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow . I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome , Except immortal Caesar , speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke , Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes .
Royal Egypt , Empress
Into what dangers would you lead me , Cassius , That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me
Peace , peace , Iras .
Therefore , good Brutus , be prepared to hear . And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection , I , your glass , Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of . And be not jealous on me , gentle Brutus . Were I a common laugher , or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester , if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And , after , scandal them , or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout , then hold me dangerous .
No more but e’en a woman , and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares . It were for me To throw my scepter at the injurious gods , To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stolen our jewel . All’s but naught . Patience is sottish , and impatience does Become a dog that’s mad . Then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death Ere death dare come to us How do you , women What , what , good cheer Why , how now , Charmian My noble girls Ah , women , women Look , Our lamp is spent , it’s out . Good sirs , take heart . We’ll bury him , and then , what’s brave , what’s noble , Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us . Come , away . This case of that huge spirit now is cold . Ah , women , women Come . We have no friend But resolution , and the briefest end .
What means this shouting I do fear , the people Choose Caesar for their king .
Hear me one word Beseech you , tribunes , hear me but a word .
Ay , do you fear it Then must I think you would not have it so .
Peace , peace
Be that you seem , truly your country’s friend , And temperately proceed to what you would Thus violently redress .
Sir , those cold ways , That seem like prudent helps , are very poisonous Where the disease is violent . Lay hands upon him , And bear him to the rock .
No , I’ll die here .
There’s some among you have beheld me fighting Come , try upon yourselves what you have seen me .
Down with that sword Tribunes , withdraw awhile .
Lay hands upon him .
Help Martius , help , You that be noble help him , young and old
Down with him , down with him
God pardon thee . Yet let me wonder , Harry , At thy affections , which do hold a wing Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors . Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost , Which by thy younger brother is supplied , And art almost an alien to the hearts Of all the court and princes of my blood . The hope and expectation of thy time Is ruined , and the soul of every man Prophetically doth forethink thy fall . Had I so lavish of my presence been , So common hackneyed in the eyes of men , So stale and cheap to vulgar company , Opinion , that did help me to the crown , Had still kept loyal to possession And left me in reputeless banishment , A fellow of no mark nor likelihood . By being seldom seen , I could not stir But like a comet I was wondered at That men would tell their children This is he . Others would say Where Which is Bolingbroke And then I stole all courtesy from heaven , And dressed myself in such humility That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts , Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths , Even in the presence of the crownèd King . Thus did I keep my person fresh and new , My presence , like a robe pontifical , Ne er seen but wondered at , and so my state , Seldom but sumptuous , showed like a feast And won by rareness such solemnity . The skipping King , he ambled up and down With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits , Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state , Mingled his royalty with cap ring fools ,
Ha , cousin Silence , that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen Ha , Sir John , said I well
We have heard the chimes at midnight , Master Shallow .
That we have , that we have , that we have . In faith , Sir John , we have . Our watchword was Hem , boys . Come , let’s to dinner come , let’s to dinner . Jesus , the days that we have seen Come , come .
Good Master Corporate Bardolph , stand my friend , and here’s four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you . In very truth , sir , I had as lief be hanged , sir , as go . And yet , for mine own part , sir , I do not care , but rather because I am unwilling , and , for mine own part , have a desire to stay with my friends . Else , sir , I did not care , for mine own part , so much .
Go to . Stand aside .
Here , sweet lord , at your service .
And , good Master Corporal Captain , for my old dame’s sake , stand my friend . She has nobody to do anything about her when I am gone , and she is old and cannot help herself You shall have forty , sir .
Horatio , thou art e en as just a man As e er my conversation coped withal .
Go to . Stand aside .
O my dear lord
By my troth , I care not . A man can die but once . We owe God a death . I’ll ne er bear a base mind . An ’t be my destiny , so an ’t be not , so . No man’s too good to serve ’s prince , and let it go which way it will , he that dies this year is quit for the next .
Nay , do not think I flatter . For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits , To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flattered No , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning . Dost thou hear Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish , her election Hath sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been As one in suffering all that suffers nothing A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta en with equal thanks . And blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled , That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger To sound what stop she please . Give me that man That is not passion’s slave , and I will wear him In my heart’s core , ay , in my heart of heart , As I do thee . Something too much of this . There is a play tonight before the king . One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father’s death . I prithee , when thou seest that act afoot , Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle . If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech , It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen , And my imaginations are as foul
Go to him , Dolabella , bid him yield . Being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks The pauses that he makes .
Caesar , I shall .
Wherefore is that And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us
I am called Dercetus . Mark Antony I served , who best was worthy Best to be served . Whilst he stood up and spoke , He was my master , and I wore my life To spend upon his haters . If thou please To take me to thee , as I was to him I’ll be to Caesar . If thou pleasest not , I yield thee up my life .
What is ’t thou say’st
I say , O Caesar , Antony is dead .
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack . The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens . The death of Antony Is not a single doom . In the name lay A moiety of the world .
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall .
It did always seem so to us . But now in the division of the kingdom , it appears not which of the dukes he values most , for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety .
Is not this your son , my lord
His breeding , sir , hath been at my charge . I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it .
I cannot conceive you .
Sir , this young fellow’s mother could , whereupon she grew round wombed , and had indeed , sir , a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed . Do you smell a fault
I cannot wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
But I have , sir , a son by order of law , some year older than this , who yet is no dearer in my account . Though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for , yet was his mother fair , there was good sport at his making , and the whoreson must be acknowledged . Do you know this noble gentleman , Edmund
Gloucester , ’tis true that we are in great danger . The greater therefore should our courage be . Good morrow , brother Bedford . God almighty , There is some soul of goodness in things evil , Would men observingly distill it out . For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , Which is both healthful and good husbandry . Besides , they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all , admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end . Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself .
Good morrow , old Sir Thomas Erpingham . A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France .
Not so , my liege , this lodging likes me better , Since I may say , Now lie I like a king .
He is dead , Caesar , Not by a public minister of justice , Nor by a hirèd knife , but that self hand Which writ his honor in the acts it did Hath , with the courage which the heart did lend it , Splitted the heart . This is his sword . I robbed his wound of it . Behold it stained With his most noble blood .
Look you , sad friends , The gods rebuke me , but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings .
Tis good for men to love their present pains Upon example . So the spirit is eased . And when the mind is quickened , out of doubt , The organs , though defunct and dead before , Break up their drowsy grave and newly move , With casted slough and fresh legerity . Lend me thy cloak , Sir Thomas . Brothers both , Commend me to the princes in our camp , Do my good morrow to them , and anon Desire them all to my pavilion .
And strange it is That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deeds .
His taints and honors Waged equal with him .
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity , but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men . Caesar is touched .
When such a spacious mirror’s set before him , He needs must see himself .
O Antony , I have followed thee to this , but we do launch Diseases in our bodies . I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day , Or look on thine . We could not stall together In the whole world . But yet let me lament With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts That thou , my brother , my competitor In top of all design , my mate in empire , Friend and companion in the front of war , The arm of mine own body , and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars , Unreconcilable , should divide Our equalness to this . Hear me , good friends
I would not , Cassius . Yet I love him well . But wherefore do you hold me here so long What is it that you would impart to me If it be aught toward the general good , Set honor in one eye and death i th other , And I will look on both indifferently , For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death .
I know that virtue to be in you , Brutus , As well as I do know your outward favor . Well , honor is the subject of my story . I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life , but , for my single self , I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself . I was born free as Caesar . So were you . We both have fed as well , and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he . For once upon a raw and gusty day , The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores , Caesar said to me , Darest thou , Cassius , now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point Upon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plungèd in And bade him follow . So indeed he did . The torrent roared , and we did buffet it With lusty sinews , throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy . But ere we could arrive the point proposed , Caesar cried , Help me , Cassius , or I sink I , as Aeneas , our great ancestor , Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear , so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar . And this man
No , my lord .
As Vulcan’s stithy . Give him heedful note . For I mine eyes will rivet to his face , And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming .
Well said . Th art a good fellow .
My lord of Kent . Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend .
Well , my lord . If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing , And ’scape detecting , I will pay the theft .
Faith , I’ll bear no base mind .
My services to your lordship .
I must love you and sue to know you better .
They are coming to the play . I must be idle . Get you a place .
Come , sir , which men shall I have
Go , get you to your house be gone , away All will be naught else .
Four of which you please .
How fares our cousin Hamlet
Sir , I shall study deserving .
Excellent , i faith , of the chameleon’s dish . I eat the air , promise crammed . You cannot feed capons so .
He hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
I have nothing with this answer , Hamlet . These words are not mine .
Get you gone .
The king is coming .
No , nor mine now . My lord , you played once i th university , you say
That did I , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
What did you enact
But I will tell you at some meeter season . The business of this man looks out of him . We’ll hear him what he says . Whence are you
I shall , my lord .
I did enact Julius Caesar . I was killed i th Capitol . Brutus killed me .
A poor Egyptian yet , the Queen my mistress , Confined in all she has , her monument , Of thy intents desires instruction , That she preparedly may frame herself To th’ way she’s forced to .
Bid her have good heart . She soon shall know of us , by some of ours , How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her , for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle .
So the gods preserve thee
Come hither , Proculeius . Go and say We purpose her no shame . Give her what comforts The quality of her passion shall require , Lest , in her greatness , by some mortal stroke She do defeat us , for her life in Rome Would be eternal in our triumph . Go , And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her .
Sir , a word with you . I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf .
Stand fast We have as many friends as enemies .
Go to , well .
Sham it be put to that
Come , Sir John , which four will you have
The gods forbid I prithee , noble friend , home to thy house Leave us to cure this cause .
Do you choose for me .
For ’tis a sore upon us , You cannot tent yourself be gone , beseech you .
Come , sir , along with us .
Marry , then , Mouldy , Bullcalf , Feeble , and Shadow .
Mouldy and Bullcalf For you , Mouldy , stay at home till you are past service . And for your part , Bullcalf , grow till you come unto it . I will none of you .
I would they were barbarians as they are , Though in Rome litter’d not Romans as they are not , Though calved i’ the porch o’ the Capitol
Be gone Put not your worthy rage into your tongue One time will owe another .
Sir John , Sir John , do not yourself wrong . They are your likeliest men , and I would have you served with the best .
Is now become a god , and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him . He had a fever when he was in Spain , And when the fit was on him , I did mark How he did shake . Tis true , this god did shake His coward lips did from their color fly , And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster . I did hear him groan , Ay , and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books Alas , it cried , give me some drink , Titinius , As a sick girl . Ye gods , it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone .
On fair ground I could beat forty of them .
Another general shout I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar .
Why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves . Men at some time are masters of their fates . The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars But in ourselves , that we are underlings . Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar Why should that name be sounded more than yours Write them together , yours is as fair a name . Sound them , it doth become the mouth as well . Weigh them , it is as heavy . Conjure with em ,
Will you tell me , Master Shallow , how to choose a man Care I for the limb , the thews , the stature , bulk , and big assemblance of a man Give me the spirit , Master Shallow . Here’s Wart . You see what a ragged appearance it is . He shall
I could myself Take up a brace o’ the best of them yea , the two tribunes But now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic And manhood is call’d foolery , when it stands Against a falling fabric . Will you hence , Before the tag return whose rage doth rend Like interrupted waters and o’erbear What they are used to bear .
Caesar , I shall .
Gallus , go you along .
Had his great name profanèd with their scorns , And gave his countenance , against his name , To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push Of every beardless vain comparative Grew a companion to the common streets , Enfeoffed himself to popularity , That , being daily swallowed by men’s eyes , They surfeited with honey and began To loathe the taste of sweetness , whereof a little More than a little is by much too much . So , when he had occasion to be seen , He was but as the cuckoo is in June , Heard , not regarded seen , but with such eyes As , sick and blunted with community , Afford no extraordinary gaze Such as is bent on sunlike majesty When it shines seldom in admiring eyes , But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down , Slept in his face , and rendered such aspect As cloudy men use to their adversaries , Being with his presence glutted , gorged , and full . And in that very line , Harry , standest thou , For thou has lost thy princely privilege With vile participation . Not an eye But is aweary of thy common sight , Save mine , which hath desired to see thee more , Which now doth that I would not have it do , Make blind itself with foolish tenderness .
I shall hereafter , my thrice gracious lord , Be more myself .
Where’s Dolabella , To second Proculeius
Dolabella
For all the world As thou art to this hour was Richard then When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh , And even as I was then is Percy now .
Let him alone , for I remember now How he’s employed . He shall in time be ready . Go with me to my tent , where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war , How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings . Go with me and see What I can show in this .
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose . Give me the map there . Know that we have divided In three our kingdom , and ’tis our fast intent To shake all cares and business from our age , Conferring them on younger strengths while we Unburdened crawl toward death . Our son of Cornwall , And you , our no less loving son of Albany , We have this hour a constant will to publish
My desolation does begin to make A better life . ’Tis paltry to be Caesar . Not being Fortune , he’s but Fortune’s knave , A minister of her will . And it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds , Which shackles accidents and bolts up change , Which sleeps and never palates more the dung , The beggar’s nurse , and Caesar’s .
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt , And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean’st to have him grant thee .
What’s thy name
My name is Proculeius .
Antony Did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but I do not greatly care to be deceived , That have no use for trusting . If your master Would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , That majesty , to keep decorum , must No less beg than a kingdom . If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son , He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks .
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar . Now in the names of all the gods at once , Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great Age , thou art shamed Rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods When went there by an age , since the great flood , But it was famed with more than with one man When could they say till now , that talked of Rome , That her wide walks encompassed but one man Now is it Rome indeed , and room enough , When there is in it but one only man . Oh , you and I have heard our fathers say , There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king .
That you do love me , I am nothing jealous . What you would work me to , I have some aim . How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter . For this present , I would not , so with love I might entreat you , Be any further moved . What you have said I will consider , what you have to say I will with patience hear , and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things . Till then , my noble friend , chew upon this Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us .
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus .
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there . Be the players ready
Ay , my lord . They stay upon your patience .
Come hither , my dear Hamlet , sit by me .
No , good mother . Here’s metal more attractive .
Oh , ho , do you mark that
Lady , shall I lie in your lap
No , my lord .
I mean , my head upon your lap
Ay , my lord .
Do you think I meant country matters
We shall , my liege .
I think nothing , my lord .
Shall I attend your Grace
That’s a fair thought to lie between maids legs .
No , my good knight . Go with my brothers to my lords of England . I and my bosom must debate awhile , And then I would no other company .
What is , my lord
The Lord in heaven bless thee , noble Harry
Nothing .
You are merry , my lord .
God a mercy , old heart , thou speak’st cheerfully .
Who , I
Ay , my lord .
Qui vous là
A friend .
Discuss unto me art thou officer or art thou base , common , and popular
I am a gentleman of a company .
Trail’st thou the puissant pike
Even so . What are you
As good a gentleman as the emperor .
Be of good cheer . You’re fall’n into a princely hand . Fear nothing . Make your full reference freely to my lord , Who is so full of grace that it flows over On all that need . Let me report to him Your sweet dependency , and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to .
Pray you , tell him I am his fortune’s vassal , and I send him The greatness he has got . I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience , and would gladly Look him i’ th’ face .
This I’ll report , dear lady . Have comfort , for I know your plight is pitied Of him that caused it .
You see how easily she may be surprised . Guard her till Caesar come .
Royal Queen
O Cleopatra Thou art taken , Queen .
Quick , quick , good hands .
Our daughters several dowers , that future strife May be prevented now . The two great princes , France and Burgundy , Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love , Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn , And here are to be answered . Tell me , my daughters , Which of you shall we say doth love us most That we our largest bounty may extend Where nature doth with merit challenge Goneril , Our eldest born , speak first .
Sir , I do love you more than words can wield the matter , Dearer than eyesight , space , and liberty , Beyond what can be valued , rich or rare , No less than life , with grace , health , beauty , honor , As much as child e er loved or father found A love that makes breath poor and speech unable . Beyond all manner of so much I love you .
What shall Cordelia speak Love , and be silent .
Of all these bounds , even from this line to this , With shadowy forests and with champains riched , With plenteous rivers and wide skirted meads , We make thee lady . To thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual . What says our second daughter , Our dearest Regan , wife of Cornwall Speak .
Sir , I am made of that self mettle as my sister , And prize me at her worth . In my true heart , I find she names my very deed of love Only she comes too short , that I profess
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
As they pass by , pluck Casca by the sleeve , And he will , after his sour fashion , tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today .
I will do so . But , look you , Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow , And all the rest look like a chidden train . Calphurnia’s cheek is pale , and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators .
Casca will tell us what the matter is .
Antonio .
Caesar .
Let me have men about me that are fat , Sleek headed men and such as sleep a nights . Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look . He thinks too much . Such men are dangerous .
Fear him not , Caesar . He’s not dangerous . He is a noble Roman and well given .
Hold , worthy lady , hold Do not yourself such wrong , who are in this Relieved but not betrayed .
What , of death too , That rids our dogs of languish
Cleopatra , Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself . Let the world see His nobleness well acted , which your death Will never let come forth .
Where art thou , Death Come hither , come Come , come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars
Oh , temperance , lady
Sir , I will eat no meat , I’ll not drink , sir . If idle talk will once be necessary , I’ll not sleep neither . This mortal house I’ll ruin , Do Caesar what he can . Know , sir , that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court , Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia . Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me . Rather on Nilus’ mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring . Rather make My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains
charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer’s hammer , come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer’s bucket . And this same half faced fellow , Shadow , give me this man . He presents no mark to the enemy . The foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife . And for a retreat , how swiftly will this Feeble the woman’s tailor , run off O , give me the spare men , and spare me the great ones . Put me a caliver into Wart’s hand , Bardolph .
Hold , Wart . Traverse . Thas , thas , thas .
Come , manage me your caliver so , very well , go to , very good , exceeding good . O , give me always a little , lean , old , chopped , bald shot . Well said , i faith , Wart . Th art a good scab . Hold , there’s a tester for thee .
He is not his craft’s master . He doth not do it right . I remember at Mile End Green , when I lay at Clement’s Inn I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur’s show there was a little quiver fellow , and he would manage you his piece thus . And he would about and about , and come you in , and come you in . Rah , tah , tah , would he say . Bounce , would he say , and away again would he go , and again would he come . I shall ne er see such a fellow .
These fellows will do well , Master Shallow . God keep you , Master Silence . I will not use many words with you . Fare you well , gentlemen both . I thank you . I must a dozen mile to night . Bardolph , give the soldiers coats .
Sir John , the Lord bless you . God prosper your affairs . God send us peace . At your return , visit our house . Let our old
O God , your only jig maker . What should a man do but be merry For , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
Nay , ’tis twice two months , my lord .
So long Nay then , let the devil wear black , for I’ll have a suit of sables . O heavens Die two months ago and not forgotten yet Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year . But , by r Lady , he must build churches then , or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the hobby horse , whose epitaph is For , oh , for , oh , the hobby horse is forgot .
Trumpets sound . The dumb show begins Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly , the Queen embracing him and he her . She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him . He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck , lays him down upon a bank of flowers . She , seeing him asleep , leaves him . Anon comes in a fellow , takes off his crown , kisses it , pours poison in the King’s ears , and exits . The Queen returns , finds the King dead , and makes passionate action . The Poisoner , with some two or three Mutes , comes in again , seeming to lament with her . The dead body is carried away . The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts . She seems loath and unwilling awhile , but in the end accepts his love
What means this , my lord
Marry , this is miching malhecho . It means mischief .
Would he were fatter But I fear him not . Yet if my name were liable to fear , I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius . He reads much . He is a great observer , and he looks Quite through the deeds of men . He loves no plays , As thou dost , Antony . He hears no music . Seldom he smiles , and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything . Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves , And therefore are they very dangerous . I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear , for always I am Caesar . Come on my right hand , for this ear is deaf , And tell me truly what thou think’st of him .
You pulled me by the cloak . Would you speak with me
Ay , Casca . Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad .
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar .
Why , you were with him , were you not
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced .
Proculeius , What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows , And he hath sent for thee . For the Queen , I’ll take her to my guard .
Why , there was a crown offered him and , being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus and then the people fell a shouting .
So , Dolabella , It shall content me best . Be gentle to her . To Caesar I will speak what you shall please , If you’ll employ me to him .
Say I would die .
Most noble Empress , you have heard of me
I cannot tell .
Assuredly you know me .
No matter , sir , what I have heard or known . You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams . Is ’t not your trick
I understand not , madam .
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony . Oh , such another sleep , that I might see But such another man
Myself an enemy to all other joys , Which the most precious square of sense possesses . And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness love .
Then poor Cordelia And yet not so , since I am sure my love’s More ponderous than my tongue .
To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom , No less in space , validity , and pleasure Than that conferred on Goneril . But now , our joy , Although our last and least , to whose young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interessed . What can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters Speak .
Nothing , my lord .
Nothing
Nothing .
How Nothing will come of nothing . Speak again .
Unhappy that I am , I cannot heave My heart into my mouth . I love your majesty According to my bond , no more nor less .
How , how , Cordelia Mend your speech a little , Lest you may mar your fortunes .
Good my lord , You have begot me , bred me , loved me . I Return those duties back as are right fit
Pray you , be gone I’ll try whether my old wit be in request With those that have but little this must be patch’d With cloth of any colour .
Nay , come away .
This man has marr’d his fortune .
His nature is too noble for the world He would not flatter Neptune for his trident , Or Jove for’s power to thunder . His heart’s his mouth What his breast forges , that his tongue must vent And , being angry , does forget that ever He heard the name of death .
Here’s goodly work SECOND PATRICIAN I would they were abed
I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance Could he not speak ’em fair
Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself
If it might please ye
His face was as the heavens , and therein stuck A sun and moon , which kept their course and lighted The little O , the earth .
Most sovereign creature
His legs bestrid the ocean . His reared arm Crested the world . His voice was propertied As all the tunèd spheres , and that to friends . But when he meant to quail and shake the orb , He was as rattling thunder . For his bounty , There was no winter in ’t , an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping . His delights Were dolphinlike they showed his back above The element they lived in . In his livery Walked crowns and crownets . Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket .
Cleopatra
Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of
Gentle madam , no .
You lie up to the hearing of the gods . But if there be nor ever were one such , It’s past the size of dreaming . Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy , yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy , Condemning shadows quite .
What was the second noise for
Why , for that too .
They shouted thrice . What was the last cry for
Why , for that too .
Was the crown offered him thrice
Ay , marry , was ’t , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted .
Who offered him the crown
Why , Antony .
Tell us the manner of it , gentle Casca .
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it . It was mere foolery . I did not mark it . I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown and , as I told you , he put it by once but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it . Then he offered it to him again , then he put it by again but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . And then he offered it the third time . He put it the third time by . And still , as he refused it , the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he swooned and fell down at it . And for mine own part , I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .
acquaintance be renewed . Peradventure I will with you to the court .
Fore God , would you would , Master Shallow .
Go to . I have spoke at a word . God keep you .
Fare you well , gentle gentlemen .
On , Bardolph . Lead the men away .
Obey you , love you , and most honor you . Why have my sisters husbands if they say They love you all Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him , half my care and duty . Sure , I shall never marry like my sisters , To love my father all .
But goes thy heart with this
Ay , good my lord .
As I return , I will fetch off these justices . I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow . Lord , Lord , how subject we old men are to this vice of lying . This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street , and every third word a lie , duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s tribute . I do remember him at Clement’s Inn , like a man made after supper of a cheese paring . When he was naked , he was , for all the world , like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife . He was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible . He was the very genius of famine , yet lecherous as a monkey , and the whores called him mandrake . He came ever in the rearward of the fashion , and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle , and swore they were his fancies or his good nights . And now is this Vice’s dagger become a squire , and talks as familiarly of John o Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him , and I’ll be sworn he ne er saw him but once in the
So young and so untender
So young , my lord , and true .
Let it be so . Thy truth then be thy dower . For by the sacred radiance of the sun , The mysteries of Hecate and the night , By all the operation of the orbs From whom we do exist and cease to be Here I disclaim all my paternal care , Propinquity , and property of blood , And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever . The barbarous Scythian , Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite , shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored , pitied , and relieved As thou my sometime daughter .
Good my liege
Peace , Kent . Come not between the dragon and his wrath . I loved her most and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery .
Now , by my scepter , and my soul to boot , He hath more worthy interest to the state Than thou , the shadow of succession . For of no right , nor color like to right , He doth fill fields with harness in the realm , Turns head against the lion’s armèd jaws , And , being no more in debt to years than thou , Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on To bloody battles and to bruising arms . What never dying honor hath he got Against renownèd Douglas , whose high deeds , Whose hot incursions and great name in arms , Holds from all soldiers chief majority And military title capital Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ . Thrice hath this Hotspur , Mars in swathling clothes , This infant warrior , in his enterprises Discomfited great Douglas , ta en him once , Enlargèd him , and made a friend of him , To fill the mouth of deep defiance up And shake the peace and safety of our throne . And what say you to this Percy , Northumberland , The Archbishop’s Grace of York , Douglas , Mortimer , Capitulate against us and are up . But wherefore do I tell these news to thee Why , Harry , do I tell thee of my foes , Which art my nearest and dearest enemy Thou that art like enough , through vassal fear , Base inclination , and the start of spleen , To fight against me under Percy’s pay , To dog his heels , and curtsy at his frowns , To show how much thou art degenerate .
Do not think so . You shall not find it so . And God forgive them that so much have swayed Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me .
Belike this show imports the argument of the play .
We shall know by this fellow . The players cannot keep counsel . They’ll tell all .
Hear me , good madam . Your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it As answering to the weight . Would I might never O’ertake pursued success , but I do feel , By the rebound of yours , a grief that smites My very heart at root .
Will he tell us what this show meant
I thank you , sir . Know you what Caesar means to do with me
Ay , or any show that you will show him . Be not you ashamed to show , he’ll not shame to tell you what it means .
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew .
You are naught , you are naught . I’ll mark the play .
Nay , pray you , sir .
Though he be honorable
For us and for our tragedy , Here stooping to your clemency , We beg your hearing patiently .
He’ll lead me , then , in triumph .
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
Madam , he will . I know ’t .
Then you are a better than the king .
Tis brief , my lord .
The king’s a bawcock , and a heart of gold , A lad of life , an imp of fame , Of parents good , of fist most valiant . I kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring I love the lovely bully . What is thy name
Make way there Caesar
Which is the Queen of Egypt
It is the Emperor , madam .
Arise , you shall not kneel . I pray you , rise . Rise , Egypt .
Hence , and avoid my sight So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father’s heart from her . Call France . Who stirs Call Burgundy .
Sir , the gods Will have it thus . My master and my lord I must obey .
As woman’s love .
Harry le Roy .
Le Roy A Cornish name . Art thou of Cornish crew
No , I am a Welshman .
Know’st thou Fluellen
Yes .
Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy’s day .
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
Art thou his friend
And his kinsman too .
The figo for thee then
I thank you . God be with you .
My name is Pistol called .
Cornwall and Albany , With my two daughters dowers digest this third . Let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her . I do invest you jointly with my power , Preeminence , and all the large effects That troop with majesty . Ourself , by monthly course , With reservation of an hundred knights By you to be sustained , shall our abode Make with you by due turns . Only shall we retain The name , and all th additions to a king . The sway , revenue , execution of the rest , Belovèd sons , be yours which to confirm , This coronet part between you .
Royal Lear , Whom I have ever honored as my king , Loved as my father , as my master followed , As my great patron thought on in my prayers
The bow is bent and drawn . Make from the shaft .
Let it fall rather , though the fork invade The region of my heart . Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad . What wouldst thou do , old man Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows To plainness honor’s bound When majesty falls to folly . Reserve thy state ,
Take to you no hard thoughts . The record of what injuries you did us , Though written in our flesh , we shall remember As things but done by chance .
Sole sir o’ th’ world , I cannot project mine own cause so well To make it clear , but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often shamed our sex .
You worthy tribunes ,
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands he hath resisted law , And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at nought .
I will redeem all this on Percy’s head , And , in the closing of some glorious day , Be bold to tell you that I am your son , When I will wear a garment all of blood And stain my favors in a bloody mask , Which , washed away , shall scour my shame with it . And that shall be the day , whene er it lights , That this same child of honor and renown , This gallant Hotspur , this all praisèd knight , And your unthought of Harry chance to meet . For every honor sitting on his helm , Would they were multitudes , and on my head My shames redoubled For the time will come That I shall make this northern youth exchange His glorious deeds for my indignities . Percy is but my factor , good my lord , To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf . And I will call him to so strict account That he shall render every glory up , Yea , even the slightest worship of his time , Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart . This in the name of God I promise here , The which if He be pleased I shall perform , I do beseech your Majesty may salve The long grown wounds of my intemperance . If not , the end of life cancels all bands , And I will die a hundred thousand deaths Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow .
Cleopatra , know We will extenuate rather than enforce . If you apply yourself to our intents , Which towards you are most gentle , you shall find A benefit in this change , but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony’s course , you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes and put your children To that destruction which I’ll guard them from If thereon you rely . I’ll take my leave .
He shall well know The noble tribunes are the people’s mouths , And we their hands .
A hundred thousand rebels die in this . Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein .
And may , through all the world ’Tis yours , and we , Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall Hang in what place you please . Here , my good lord .
He shall , sure on’t .
Sir , sir ,
Peace
Do not cry havoc , where you should but hunt With modest warrant .
Sir , how comes’t that you Have holp to make this rescue
Hear me speak As I do know the consul’s worthiness , So can I name his faults ,
Consul what consul
The consul Coriolanus .
He consul
No , no , no , no , no .
tilt yard , and then he burst his head for crowding among the Marshal’s men . I saw it and told John o Gaunt he beat his own name , for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him , a court . And now has he land and beefs . Well , I’ll be acquainted with him , if I return , and ’t shall go hard but I’ll make him a philosopher’s two stones to me . If the young dace be a bait for the old pike , I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him . Let time shape , and there an end .
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra .
This is the brief of money , plate , and jewels I am possessed of . ’Tis exactly valued , Not petty things admitted . Where’s Seleucus
Here , madam .
This is my treasurer . Let him speak , my lord , Upon his peril , that I have reserved To myself nothing . Speak the truth , Seleucus .
Madam , I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not .
What have I kept back
Enough to purchase what you have made known .
Nay , blush not , Cleopatra . I approve Your wisdom in the deed .
See , Caesar Oh , behold How pomp is followed Mine will now be yours , And , should we shift estates , yours would be mine . The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild . O slave , of no more trust Than love that’s hired What , goest thou back Thou shalt Go back , I warrant thee But I’ll catch thine eyes , Though they had wings . Slave , soulless villain , dog Oh , rarely base
And in thy best consideration check This hideous rashness . Answer my life my judgment , Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least , Nor are those empty hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness .
Kent , on thy life , no more .
My life I never held but as a pawn To wage against thy enemies , nor fear to lose it , Thy safety being motive .
Good Queen , let us entreat you
Out of my sight
See better , Lear , and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye .
O Caesar , what a wounding shame is this , That thou , vouchsafing here to visit me , Doing the honor of thy lordliness To one so meek , that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy Say , good Caesar , That I some lady trifles have reserved , Immoment toys , things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal , and say Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia , to induce Their mediation , must I be unfolded With one that I have bred The gods It smites me Beneath the fall I have . Prithee , go hence , Or I shall show the cinders of my spirit Through th’ ashes of my chance . Wert thou a man , Thou wouldst have mercy on me .
Now , by Apollo
Forbear , Seleucus .
Now , by Apollo , King , Thou swear’st thy gods in vain .
O vassal Miscreant
Be it known that we , the greatest , are misthought For things that others do , and when we fall We answer others’ merits in our name , Are therefore to be pitied .
Dear sir , forbear
Do , kill thy physician , and the fee bestow Upon thy foul disease . Revoke thy gift , Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat , I’ll tell thee thou dost evil .
Hear me , recreant On thine allegiance hear me . That thou hast sought to make us break our vows , Which we durst never yet , and with strained pride To come betwixt our sentence and our power , Which nor our nature nor our place can bear ,
But soft , I pray you . What , did Caesar swoon
He fell down in the marketplace , and foamed at mouth , and was speechless .
Tis very like . He hath the falling sickness .
No , Caesar hath it not . But you and I And honest Casca , we have the falling sickness .
I know not what you mean by that , but I am sure Caesar fell down . If the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them , as they use to do the players in the theatre , I am no true man .
What said he when he came unto himself
Marry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut . An I had been a man of any occupation , if I would not have taken him at a word , I would I might go to hell among the rogues . And so he fell . When he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity . Three or four wenches where I stood cried , Alas , good soul and forgave him with all their hearts . But there’s no heed to be taken of them . If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
And after that he came thus sad away
Ay .
Cleopatra , Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest . Still be ’t yours . Bestow it at your pleasure , and believe Caesar’s no merchant , to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold . Therefore be cheered . Make not your thoughts your prison . No , dear Queen , For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel . Feed and sleep . Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend . And so , adieu .
My master , and my lord
How now , good Blunt Thy looks are full of speed .
Not so . Adieu .
So hath the business that I come to speak of . Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word That Douglas and the English rebels met The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury . A mighty and a fearful head they are , If promises be kept on every hand , As ever offered foul play in the state .
He words me , girls , he words me , that I should not Be noble to myself . But , hark thee , Charmian .
If , by the tribunes’ leave , and yours , good people , I may be heard , I would crave a word or two The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time .
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today , With him my son , Lord John of Lancaster , For this advertisement is five days old . On Wednesday next , Harry , you shall set forward . On Thursday we ourselves will march . Our meeting Is Bridgenorth . And , Harry , you shall march Through Gloucestershire by which account , Our business valuèd , some twelve days hence Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet . Our hands are full of business . Let’s away . Advantage feeds him fat while men delay .
Finish , good lady . The bright day is done , And we are for the dark .
Speak briefly then For we are peremptory to dispatch This viperous traitor to eject him hence Were but one danger , and to keep him here Our certain death therefore it is decreed He dies to night .
Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome , whose gratitude Towards her deserved children is enroll’d In Jove’s own book , like an unnatural dam Should now eat up her own
Hie thee again . I have spoke already , and it is provided . Go put it to the haste .
He’s a disease that must be cut away .
Madam , I will .
O , he’s a limb that has but a disease Mortal , to cut it off to cure it , easy . What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death Killing our enemies , the blood he hath lost Which , I dare vouch , is more than that he hath , By many an ounce he dropp’d it for his country And what is left , to lose it by his country , Were to us all , that do’t and suffer it , A brand to the end o’ the world .
What is this forest called
Tis Gaultree Forest , an ’t shall please your Grace .
Here stand , my lords , and send discoverers forth To know the numbers of our enemies .
We have sent forth already .
Tis well done . My friends and brethren in these great affairs , I must acquaint you that I have received New dated letters from Northumberland , Their cold intent , tenor , and substance , thus Here doth he wish his person , with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality , The which he could not levy whereupon He is retired , to ripe his growing fortunes , To Scotland , and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful melting of their opposite .
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to pieces .
Where’s the Queen
Behold , sir .
Dolabella
Madam , as thereto sworn by your command , Which my love makes religion to obey , I tell you this Caesar through Syria Intends his journey , and within three days You with your children will he send before . Make your best use of this . I have performed Your pleasure and my promise .
Dolabella , I shall remain your debtor .
I your servant . Adieu , good Queen . I must attend on Caesar .
Farewell , and thanks .
Now , Iras , what think’st thou Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown In Rome , as well as I . Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall Uplift us to the view . In their thick breaths , Rank of gross diet , shall be enclouded , And forced to drink their vapor .
The gods forbid
Nay , ’tis most certain , Iras . Saucy lictors Will catch at us like strumpets , and scald rhymers Ballad us out o’ tune . The quick comedians Extemporally will stage us and present Our Alexandrian revels . Antony Shall be brought drunken forth , and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness I’ th’ posture of a whore .
Oh , the good gods
Nay , that’s certain .
I’ll never see ’t For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes .
Why , that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents .
Now , Charmian Show me , my women , like a queen . Go fetch My best attires . I am again for Cydnus , To meet Mark Antony . Sirrah Iras , go . Now , noble Charmian , we’ll dispatch indeed , And when thou hast done this chare I’ll give thee leave To play till doomsday . Bring our crown and all .
Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus orbèd ground , And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been , Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands .
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o er ere love be done . But woe is me You are so sick of late , So far from cheer and from your former state , That I distrust you . Yet though I distrust , Discomfort you , my lord , it nothing must . For women fear too much , even as they love , And women’s fear and love hold quantity , In neither aught , or in extremity . Now what my love is , proof hath made you know , And as my love is sized , my fear is so Where love is great , the littlest doubts are fear . Where little fears grow great , great love grows there .
Faith , I must leave thee , love , and shortly too . My operant powers their functions leave to do . And thou shalt live in this fair world behind , Honored , beloved , and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou
Oh , confound the rest Such love must needs be treason in my breast . In second husband let me be accursed None wed the second but who killed the first .
Wormwood , wormwood .
Did Cicero say anything
Ay , he spoke Greek .
To what effect
Nay , an I tell you that , I’ll ne er look you i th face again . But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads . But , for mine own part , it was Greek to me . I could tell you more news too . Murellus and Flavius , for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images , are put to silence . Fare you well . There was more foolery yet , if I could remember it .
Will you sup with me tonight , Casca
No , I am promised forth .
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Ay , if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
Good . I will expect you .
Do so . Farewell both .
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be He was quick mettle when he went to school .
Bardolph , am I not fallen away vilely since this last action Do I not bate Do I not dwindle Why , my skin hangs about me like an like an old lady’s loose gown . I am withered like an old applejohn . Well , I’ll repent , and that suddenly , while I am in some liking . I shall be out of heart shortly , and then I shall have no strength to repent . An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of , I am a peppercorn , a brewer’s horse . The inside of a church Company , villanous company , hath been the spoil of me .
Sir John , you are so fretful you cannot live long .
Why , there is it . Come sing me a bawdy song , make me merry . I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be , virtuous enough swore little diced not above seven times a week went to a bawdy house once in a quarter of an hour paid money that I borrowed , three or four times lived well and in good compass and now I live out of all order , out of all compass .
Why , you are so fat , Sir John , that you must needs be out of all compass , out of all reasonable compass , Sir John .
Do thou amend thy face , and I’ll amend my life . Thou art our admiral , thou bearest the lantern in the poop , but ’tis in the nose of thee . Thou art the knight of the burning lamp .
Why , Sir John , my face does you no harm .
This is clean kam .
Merely awry when he did love his country , It honour’d him .
The service of the foot Being once gangrened , is not then respected For what before it was .
We’ll hear no more . Pursue him to his house , and pluck him thence Lest his infection , being of catching nature , Spread further .
One word more , one word . This tiger footed rage , when it shall find The harm of unscann’d swiftness , will too late Tie leaden pounds to’s heels . Proceed by process Lest parties , as he is beloved , break out , And sack great Rome with Romans .
If it were so ,
It sorts well with your fierceness .
What do ye talk Have we not had a taste of his obedience Our aediles smote ourselves resisted Come .
Captain Fluellen .
Consider this he has been bred i’ the wars Since he could draw a sword , and is ill school’d In bolted language meal and bran together He throws without distinction . Give me leave , I’ll go to him , and undertake to bring him Where he shall answer , by a lawful form , In peace , to his utmost peril .
So . In the name of Jesu Christ , speak fewer . It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept . If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great , you shall find , I warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey’s camp . I warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise .
Why , the enemy is loud . You hear him all night .
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience , now
I will speak lower .
I pray you and beseech you that you will .
Wherefore’s this noise
Though it appear a little out of fashion , There is much care and valor in this Welshman .
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness’ presence . He brings you figs .
Let him come in .
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed He brings me liberty . My resolution’s placed , and I have nothing Of woman in me . Now from head to foot I am marble constant . Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine .
This is the man .
Avoid , and leave him .
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there , That kills and pains not
Truly , I have him , but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal . Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
Our potency made good , take thy reward Five days we do allot thee for provision To shield thee from diseases of the world . And on the sixth to turn thy hated back Upon our kingdom . If on the next day following Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions , The moment is thy death . Away By Jupiter , This shall not be revoked .
Why , fare thee well , King . Sith thus thou wilt appear , Freedom lives hence , and banishment is here . And your large speeches may your deeds approve , That good effects may spring from words of love . Thus Kent , O princes , bids you all adieu . He’ll shape his old course in a country new .
Here’s France and Burgundy , my noble lord .
My lord of Burgundy . We first address towards you , who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter . What in the least Will you require in present dower with her Or cease your quest of love
Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t
Very many , men and women too . I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman , but something given to lie , as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it , what pain she felt . Truly , she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm . But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do . But this is most falliable , the worm’s an odd worm .
Get thee hence , farewell .
I wish you all joy of the worm .
Farewell .
You must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
Ay , ay . Farewell .
Look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for indeed there is no goodness in the worm .
Take thou no care . It shall be heeded .
Very good . Give it nothing , I pray you , for it is not worth the feeding .
Will it eat me
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman . I know that a woman is a dish for the gods , if the devil dress her not . But , truly , these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women , for in every ten that they make , the devils mar five .
Now , what news
West of this forest , scarcely off a mile , In goodly form comes on the enemy , And , by the ground they hide , I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand .
The just proportion that we gave them out . Let us sway on and face them in the field .
What well appointed leader fronts us here
I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland .
Health and fair greeting from our general , The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster .
Say on , my Lord of Westmoreland , in peace , What doth concern your coming .
Then , my lord , Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech . If that rebellion Came like itself , in base and abject routs , Led on by bloody youth , guarded with rage , And countenanced by boys and beggary I say , if damn’d commotion so appeared In his true , native , and most proper shape , You , reverend father , and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection
Well , get thee gone . Farewell .
Yes , forsooth . I wish you joy o’ th’ worm .
Give me my robe . Put on my crown . I have Immortal longings in me . Now no more The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip .
Yare , yare , good Iras , quick . Methinks I hear Antony call . I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act . I hear him mock The luck of Caesar , which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath . Husband , I come Now to that name my courage prove my title I am fire and air , my other elements I give to baser life . So , have you done Come then and take the last warmth of my lips . Farewell , kind Charmian . Iras , long farewell .
No , I’ll be sworn , I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s head or a memento mori . I never see thy face but I think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple , for there he is in his robes , burning , burning . If thou wert any way given to virtue , I would swear by thy face . My oath should be By this fire , that’s God’s angel . But thou art altogether given over , and wert indeed , but for the light in thy face , the son of utter darkness . When thou rannest up Gadshill in the night to catch my horse , if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus , or a ball of wildfire , there’s no purchase in money . O , thou art a perpetual triumph , an everlasting bonfire light Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches , walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in Europe . I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years , God reward me for it .
Have I the aspic in my lips Dost fall If thou and nature can so gently part , The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch , Which hurts , and is desired . Dost thou lie still If thus thou vanishest , thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave taking .
Sblood , I would my face were in your belly
Godamercy , so should I be sure to be heart burned
How now , Dame Partlet the hen , have you enquired yet who picked my pocket
Why , Sir John , what do you think , Sir John , do you think I keep thieves in my house I have searched , I have enquired , so has my husband , man by man , boy by boy , servant by servant . The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before .
Noble tribunes , It is the humane way the other course Will prove too bloody , and the end of it Unknown to the beginning .
Noble Menenius , Be you then as the people’s officer . Masters , lay down your weapons .
Go not home .
Meet on the market place . We’ll attend you there Where , if you bring not Martius , we’ll proceed In our first way .
Dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that I may say The gods themselves do weep
I’ll bring him to you .
This proves me base . If she first meet the curlèd Antony , He’ll make demand of her and spend that kiss Which is my heaven to have . Come , thou mortal wretch ,
Pray you , let’s to him .
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie . Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch . Oh , couldst thou speak , That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied
O eastern star
Peace , peace Dost thou not see my baby at my breast , That sucks the nurse asleep
Oh , break Oh , break
As sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle O Antony Nay , I will take thee too .
What should I stay
In this wild world So , fare thee well . Now boast thee , Death , in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled . Downy windows , close ,
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise , However he puts on this tardy form . This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite .
And so it is . For this time I will leave you . Tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , I will come home to you . Or , if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you .
I will do so . Till then , think of the world .
Brother John Bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder
I think it be , but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day .
We see yonder the beginning of the day , but I think we shall never see the end of it . Who goes there
Well , Brutus , thou art noble . Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed . Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes , For who so firm that cannot be seduced Caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves Brutus . If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius , He should not humor me . I will this night , In several hands , in at his windows throw , As if they came from several citizens , Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at . And after this let Caesar seat him sure , For we will shake him , or worse days endure .
A friend .
Under what captain serve you
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham .
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman . I pray you , what thinks he of our estate
Even as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
He hath not told his thought to the king
No . Nor it is not meet he should , for , though I speak it to you , I think the king is but a man as I am . The violet smells to him as it doth to me . The element shows to him as it doth to me . All his senses have but human conditions . His ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man , and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing . Therefore , when he sees reason of fears as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are . Yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal Your crown’s awry . I’ll mend it and then play
The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift , but none of love . A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed .
With your fair honors . You , Lord Archbishop , Whose see is by a civil peace maintained , Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touched , Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutored , Whose white investments figure innocence , The dove and very blessèd spirit of peace , Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace , that bears such grace , Into the harsh and boist rous tongue of war , Turning your books to graves , your ink to blood , Your pens to lances , and your tongue divine To a trumpet and a point of war
Where’s the Queen
Speak softly . Wake her not .
Caesar hath sent
Wherefore do I this So the question stands . Briefly , to this end we are all diseased , And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever , And we must bleed for it of which disease Our late King Richard , being infected , died . But , my most noble Lord of Westmoreland , I take not on me here as a physician , Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men , But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life . Hear me more plainly . I have in equal balance justly weighed What wrongs our arms may do , what wrongs we suffer , And find our griefs heavier than our offenses . We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforced from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion , And have the summary of all our griefs , When time shall serve , to show in articles Which long ere this we offered to the King
I do believe you think what now you speak , But what we do determine oft we break . Purpose is but the slave to memory , Of violent birth , but poor validity , Which now , like fruit unripe , sticks on the tree , But fall , unshaken , when they mellow be . Most necessary ’tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt . What to ourselves in passion we propose , The passion ending , doth the purpose lose . The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy . Where joy most revels , grief doth most lament . Grief joys , joy grieves on slender accident . This world is not for aye , nor ’tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change . For ’tis a question left us yet to prove , Whether love lead fortune , or else fortune love . The great man down , you mark his favorite flies . The poor advanced makes friends of enemies . And hitherto doth love on fortune tend , For who not needs shall never lack a friend , And who in want a hollow friend doth try , Directly seasons him his enemy . But , orderly to end where I begun , Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown . Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our own . So think thou wilt no second husband wed , But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead .
Too slow a messenger .
Oh , come apace , dispatch I partly feel thee .
Approach , ho All’s not well . Caesar’s beguiled .
There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar . Call him .
What work is here , Charmian Is this well done
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings . Ah , soldier
How goes it here
All dead .
Caesar , thy thoughts Touch their effects in this . Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder .
Most royal majesty , I crave no more than hath your highness offered . Nor will you tender less .
Right noble Burgundy , When she was dear to us we did hold her so , But now her price is fallen . Sir , there she stands . If aught within that little seeming substance , Or all of it , with our displeasure pieced And nothing more , may fitly like your grace , She’s there , and she is yours .
I know no answer .
Sir , will you , with those infirmities she owes Unfriended , new adopted to our hate , Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath Take her or leave her
Pardon me , royal sir . Election makes not up in such conditions .
Then leave her , sir , for by the power that made me , I tell you all her wealth . For you , great King , I would not from your love make such a stray To match you where I hate . Therefore beseech you T avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed Almost t acknowledge hers .
This is most strange , That she that even but now was your best object The argument of your praise , balm of your age , Most best , most dearest should in this trice of time
A way there , a way for Caesar
O sir , you are too sure an augurer . That you did fear is done .
Bravest at the last , She leveled at our purposes and , being royal , Took her own way . The manner of their deaths I do not see them bleed .
Who was last with them
A simple countryman that brought her figs . This was his basket .
Poisoned , then .
Oh , Caesar , This Charmian lived but now . She stood and spake . I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress . Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped .
Oh , noble weakness If they had swallowed poison , ’twould appear By external swelling , but she looks like sleep , As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace .
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood , and something blown . The like is on her arm .
He may show what outward courage he will , but I believe , as cold a night as ’tis , he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were , and I by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .
By my troth , I will speak my conscience of the king . I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .
Then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed , and a many poor men’s lives saved .
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds . Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company , his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .
That’s more than we know .
Nor earth to me give food , nor heaven light . Sport and repose lock from me day and night . To desperation turn my trust and hope . An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope . Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy . Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife If , once a widow , ever I be wife
And might by no suit gain our audience . When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs , We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong . The dangers of the days but newly gone , Whose memory is written on the earth With yet appearing blood , and the examples Of every minute’s instance , present now , Hath put us in these ill beseeming arms , Not to break peace or any branch of it , But to establish here a peace indeed , Concurring both in name and quality .
If she should break it now
When ever yet was your appeal denied Wherein have you been gallèd by the King What peer hath been suborned to grate on you , That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotion’s bitter edge
Tis deeply sworn . Sweet , leave me here awhile . My spirits grow dull , and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep .
My brother general , the commonwealth , To brother born an household cruelty , I make my quarrel in particular .
Sleep rock thy brain , And never come mischance between us twain .
There is no need of any such redress , Or if there were , it not belongs to you .
You lie , hostess . Bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair and I’ll be sworn my pocket was picked . Go to , you are a woman , go .
Why not to him in part , and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honors
Madam , how like you this play
Who , I No I defy thee God’s light , I was never called so in mine own house before .
O , my good Lord Mowbray , Construe the times to their necessities ,
The lady protests too much , methinks .
Ay , or more than we should seek after , for we know enough if we know we are the king’s subjects . If his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .
Go to , I know you well enough .
Oh , but she’ll keep her word .
But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , We died at such a place , some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left . I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of anything , when blood is their argument Now , if these men do not die well , it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it , who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection .
No , Sir John , you do not know me , Sir John . I know you , Sir John . You owe me money , Sir John , and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it . I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back .
Have you heard the argument Is there no offense in ’t
Dowlas , filthy dowlas . I have given them away to bakers wives they have made bolters of them .
No , no , they do but jest . Poison in jest . No offense i th world .
Now , as I am a true woman , holland of eight shillings an ell . You owe money here besides , Sir John , for your diet and by drinkings , and money lent you , four and twenty pound .
What do you call the play
He had his part of it . Let him pay .
He Alas , he is poor . He hath nothing .
How , poor Look upon his face . What call you rich Let them coin his nose . Let them coin his cheeks . I’ll not pay a denier . What , will you make a younker of me Shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I shall have my pocket picked I have lost a seal ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark .
O Jesu , I have heard the Prince tell him , I know not how oft , that that ring was copper
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle So many folds of favor . Sure , her offense Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it , which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Could never plant in me .
I yet beseech your majesty , If for I want that glib and oily art To speak and purpose not since what I well intend , I’ll do ’t before I speak that you make known It is no vicious blot , murder , or foulness , No unchaste action or dishonored step That hath deprived me of your grace and favor , But even for want of that for which I am richer A still soliciting eye and such a tongue As I am glad I have not , though not to have it Hath lost me in your liking .
Go to , go to . Better thou Hadst not been born than not t have pleased me better .
Is it no more but this a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do My lord of Burgundy , What say you to the lady Love’s not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from th entire point . Will you have her She is herself a dowry .
Royal King , Give but that portion which yourself proposed , And here I take Cordelia by the hand , Duchess of Burgundy .
This is an aspic’s trail , and these fig leaves Have slime upon them , such as th’ aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile .
Most probable That so she died , for her physician tells me She hath pursued conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die . Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument . She shall be buried by her Antony . No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous . High events as these Strike those that make them , and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented . Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral , And then to Rome . Come , Dolabella , see High order in this great solemnity .
Good even , Casca . Brought you Caesar home Why are you breathless And why stare you so
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero , I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks , and I have seen Th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds , But never till tonight , never till now , Did I go through a tempest dropping fire . Either there is a civil strife in heaven , Or else the world , too saucy with the gods , Incenses them to send destruction .
Why , saw you anything more wonderful
The Mousetrap . Marry , how Tropically . This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna . Gonzago is the duke’s name , his wife Baptista . You shall see anon . Tis a knavish piece of work , but what o that Your majesty and we that have free souls , it touches us not . Let the galled jade wince , our withers are unwrung .
This is one Lucianus , nephew to the king .
You are as good as a chorus , my lord .
I could interpret between you and your love , if I could see the puppets dallying .
You are keen , my lord , you are keen .
It would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge .
Still better and worse .
So you must take your husbands . Begin , murderer . Pox , leave thy damnable faces , and begin . Come , The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge
Thoughts black , hands apt , drugs fit , and time agreeing , Confederate season , else no creature seeing , Thou mixture rank , of midnight weeds collected , With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted , thrice infected , Thy natural magic and dire property On wholesome life usurp immediately .
And you shall say indeed it is the time , And not the King , that doth you injuries . Yet for your part , it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on . Were you not restored To all the Duke of Norfolk’s seigniories , Your noble and right well remembered father’s
A common slave you know him well by sight Held up his left hand , which did flame and burn Like twenty torches joined , and yet his hand , Not sensible of fire , remained unscorched . Besides I ha not since put up my sword Against the Capitol I met a lion , Who glared upon me and went surly by , Without annoying me . And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women , Transformèd with their fear , who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets .
What thing , in honor , had my father lost , That need to be revived and breathed in me The King that loved him , as the state stood then , Was force perforce compelled to banish him , And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he , Being mounted and both rousèd in their seats , Their neighing coursers daring of the spur , Their armèd staves in charge , their beavers down , Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together , Then , then , when there was nothing could have stayed My father from the breast of Bolingbroke , O , when the King did throw his warder down His own life hung upon the staff he threw Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke .
You speak , Lord Mowbray , now you know not what . The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman . Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled But if your father had been victor there , He ne er had borne it out of Coventry For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
How The Prince is a jack , a sneak up . Sblood , an he were here , I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so .
How now , lad , is the wind in that door , i faith Must we all march
Yea , two and two , Newgate fashion .
My lord , I pray you , hear me .
What sayest thou , Mistress Quickly How doth thy husband I love him well he is an honest man .
Good my lord , hear me .
Prithee , let her alone , and list to me .
What say’st thou , Jack
The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras , and had my pocket picked . This house is turned bawdy house they pick pockets .
What didst thou lose , Jack
Wilt thou believe me , Hal , three or four bonds of forty pound apiece , and a seal ring of my grandfather’s .
A trifle , some eightpenny matter .
Let them puff all about mine ears , present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses’ heels , Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock , That the precipitation might down stretch Below the beam of sight , yet will I still Be thus to them .
You do the nobler .
I muse my mother Does not approve me further , who was wont To call them woollen vassals , things created To buy and sell with groats , to show bare heads In congregations , to yawn , be still and wonder , When one but of my ordinance stood up To speak of peace or war .
I talk of you Why did you wish me milder would you have me False to my nature Rather say I play The man I am .
O , sir , sir , sir , I would have had you put your power well on , Before you had worn it out .
Nothing . I have sworn . I am firm .
I am sorry then . You have so lost a father That you must lose a husband .
Peace be with Burgundy . Since that respects and fortunes are his love , I shall not be his wife .
Fairest Cordelia , that art most rich being poor , Most choice forsaken , and most loved despised Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon , Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away . Gods , gods Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect My love should kindle to inflamed respect . Thy dowerless daughter , King , thrown to my chance , Is queen of us , of ours , and our fair France . Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me . Bid them farewell , Cordelia , though unkind . Thou losest here , a better where to find .
Thou hast her , France . Let her be thine , for we Have no such daughter , nor shall ever see That face of hers again . Therefore be gone Without our grace , our love , our benison . Come , noble Burgundy .
Bid farewell to your sisters .
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon day upon the marketplace , Hooting and shrieking . When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet , let not men say , These are their reasons . They are natural . For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon .
Indeed , it is a strange disposèd time . But men may construe things after their fashion , Clean from the purpose of the things themselves . Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
He doth , for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow .
Good night then , Casca . This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in .
Farewell , Cicero .
Who’s there
A Roman .
Casca , by your voice .
Your ear is good . Cassius , what night is this
A very pleasing night to honest men .
Who ever knew the heavens menace so
He poisons him i th garden for ’s estate . His name’s Gonzago . The story is extant , and writ in choice Italian . You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife .
The king rises .
What , frighted with false fire
How fares my lord
Give o er the play .
Give me some light , away
Lights , lights , lights
When shall we three meet again In thunder , lightning , or in rain
When the hurly burly’s done , When the battle’s lost and won .
Why , let the stricken deer go weep , The hart ungallèd play . For some must watch while some must sleep . So runs the world away . Would not this , sir , and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes , get me a fellowship in a cry of players
That will be ere the set of sun .
Half a share .
Where the place
Upon the heath .
A whole one , I . For thou dost know , O Damon dear , This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself . And now reigns here A very , very pajock .
There to meet with Macbeth .
I come , Graymalkin
Paddock calls .
Anon .
Fair is foul , and foul is fair Hover through the fog and filthy air .
So , if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea , the imputation of his wickedness , by your rule , should be imposed upon his father that sent him . Or if a servant , under his master’s command transporting a sum of money , be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities , you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation . But this is not so . The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services . Besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrament of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers . Some , peradventure , have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some , of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some , making the wars their bulwark , that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery . Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God . War is His beadle , war is His vengeance , so that here men are punished for before breach of the king’s laws in now the king’s quarrel . Where they feared the death , they have borne life away and where they would be safe , they perish . Then , if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited . Every subject’s duty is the king’s , but every subject’s soul is his own . Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience . And , dying so , death is to him advantage or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained . And in him that escapes , it were not sin to think that , making God so free an offer , He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare .
Were set on Hereford , whom they doted on And blessed and graced , indeed more than the King . But this is mere digression from my purpose . Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs , to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just , You shall enjoy them , everything set off That might so much as think you enemies .
But he hath forced us to compel this offer And it proceeds from policy , not love .
Mowbray , you overween to take it so . This offer comes from mercy , not from fear . For , lo , within a ken our army lies , Upon mine honor , all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear . Our battle is more full of names than yours , Our men more perfect in the use of arms , Our armor all as strong , our cause the best . Then reason will our hearts should be as good . Say you not then our offer is compelled .
Well , by my will , we shall admit no parley .
That argues but the shame of your offense . A rotten case abides no handling .
Hath the Prince John a full commission , In very ample virtue of his father , To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon
What bloody man is that He can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the revolt The newest state .
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought Gainst my captivity . Hail , brave friend Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it .
Doubtful it stood , As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art . The merciless Macdonwald Worthy to be a rebel , for to that The multiplying villanies of nature Do swarm upon him from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied , And fortune , on his damnèd quarrel smiling , Showed like a rebel’s whore . But all’s too weak , For brave Macbeth well he deserves that name Disdaining fortune , with his brandished steel , Which smoked with bloody execution , Like valor’s minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave Which ne er shook hands , nor bade farewell to him , Till he unseamed him from the nave to th chops , And fixed his head upon our battlements .
O valiant cousin Worthy gentleman
The jewels of our father , with washed eyes Cordelia leaves you . I know you what you are , And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named . Love well our father . To your professèd bosoms I commit him . But yet , alas , stood I within his grace , I would prefer him to a better place . So farewell to you both .
Prescribe not us our duty .
Let your study Be to content your lord , who hath received you At fortune’s alms . You have obedience scanted , And well are worth the want that you have wanted .
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , Who covers faults at last with shame derides . Well may you prosper .
Come , my fair Cordelia .
Sister , it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both . I think our father will hence tonight .
That’s most certain , and with you . Next month with us .
You see how full of changes his age is . The observation we have made of it hath not been little . He always loved our sister most , and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly .
Those that have known the earth so full of faults . For my part , I have walked about the streets , Submitting me unto the perilous night , And , thus unbracèd , Casca , as you see , Have bared my bosom to the thunder stone . And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven , I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it .
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us .
You are dull , Casca , and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want , Or else you use not . You look pale , and gaze , And put on fear , and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens . But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires , why all these gliding ghosts , Why birds and beasts from quality and kind , Why old men fool and children calculate , Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformèd faculties To monstrous quality why , you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state . Now could I , Casca , name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night , That thunders , lightens , opens graves , and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol
You might have rhymed .
O good Horatio , I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound . Didst perceive
So I told him , my lord , and I said I heard your Grace say so . And , my lord , he speaks most vilely of you , like a foul mouthed man as he is , and said he would cudgel you .
Very well , my lord .
What , he did not
Upon the talk of the poisoning
There’s neither faith , truth , nor womanhood in me else .
I did very well note him .
There’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune , nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox , and for womanhood , Maid Marian may be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee . Go , you thing , go .
Ah ha Come , some music Come , the recorders For if the king like not the comedy , Why then , belike , he likes it not , perdy . Come , some music
Say , what thing , what thing
Good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
What thing Why , a thing to thank God on .
Sir , a whole history .
I am no thing to thank God on , I would thou shouldst know it I am an honest man’s wife , and , setting thy knighthood aside , thou art a knave to call me so .
The king , sir
Setting thy womanhood aside , thou art a beast to say otherwise .
Ay , sir , what of him
Say , what beast , thou knave , thou
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
What beast Why , an otter .
An otter , Sir John . Why an otter
Why , she’s neither fish nor flesh a man knows not where to have her .
As whence the sun gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break , So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come Discomfort swells . Mark , King of Scotland , mark No sooner justice had , with valor armed , Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels , But the Norweyan lord , surveying vantage , With furbished arms and new supplies of men , Began a fresh assault .
Tis the infirmity of his age . Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
Dismayed not this our captains , Macbeth and Banquo
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash . Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment .
There is further compliment of leave taking between France and him . Pray you , let’s sit together . If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears , this last surrender of his will but offend us .
Yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion . If I say sooth , I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks , So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe . Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I cannot tell But I am faint , my gashes cry for help .
We shall further think on ’t .
We must do something , and i th heat .
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds They smack of honor both . Go get him surgeons .
Who comes here
The worthy thane of Ross .
What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look That seems to speak things strange .
Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head . The king is not to answer it .
I do not desire he should answer for me , and yet I determine to fight lustily for him .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
Ay , he said so , to make us fight cheerfully , but when our throats are cut , he may be ransomed , and we ne er the wiser .
If I live to see it , I will never trust his word after .
You pay him then . That’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch . You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather . You’ll never trust his word after . Come , ’tis a foolish saying .
Your reproof is something too round . I should be angry with you if the time were convenient .
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
That is intended in the General’s name . I muse you make so slight a question .
Then take , my Lord of Westmoreland , this schedule , For this contains our general grievances . Each several article herein redressed , All members of our cause , both here and hence , That are insinewed to this action , Acquitted by a true substantial form And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confined , We come within our awful banks again And knit our powers to the arm of peace .
This will I show the General . Please you , lords , In sight of both our battles we may meet , And either end in peace , which God so frame , Or to the place of difference call the swords Which must decide it .
My lord , we will do so .
There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand .
Fear you not that . If we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon , Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains .
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action , yet prodigious grown , And fearful as these strange eruptions are .
Tis Caesar that you mean . Is it not , Cassius
Let it be who it is . For Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors , But woe the while our fathers minds are dead , And we are governed with our mothers spirits . Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
Yea , but our valuation shall be such That every slight and false derivèd cause , Yea , every idle , nice , and wanton reason , Shall to the King taste of this action ,
Indeed , they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king , And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy .
Let go .
You might have been enough the man you are , With striving less to be so lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions , if You had not show’d them how ye were disposed Ere they lack’d power to cross you .
I know where I will wear this dagger then . Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius . Therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong . Therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat . Nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , Nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit . But life , being weary of these worldly bars , Never lacks power to dismiss itself . If I know this , know all the world besides , That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure .
So can I . So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity .
Thou , nature , art my goddess . To thy law My services are bound . Wherefore should I Stand in the plague of custom and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines Lag of a brother Why bastard Wherefore base When my dimensions are as well compact , My mind as generous , and my shape as true As honest madam’s issue Why brand they us With base , with baseness , bastardy , base , base Who in the lusty stealth of nature take More composition and fierce quality Than doth within a dull , stale , tirèd bed Go to th creating a whole tribe of fops Got ’tween a sleep and wake Well then , Legitimate Edgar , I must have your land . Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund As to the legitimate . Fine word , legitimate Well , my legitimate , if this letter speed And my invention thrive , Edmund the base Shall top th legitimate . I grow , I prosper . Now , gods , stand up for bastards
Kent banished thus And France in choler parted And the king gone tonight , prescribed his power Confined to exhibition All this done Upon the gad Edmund , how now What news
With drink , sir
No , my lord , with choler .
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor . For , for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler .
Good my lord , put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair .
I am tame , sir . Pronounce .
The queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
You are welcome .
Thou art an unjust man in saying so . Thou or any man knows where to have me , thou knave , thou .
Nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed . If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer , I will do your mother’s commandment . If not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
Thou sayest true , hostess , and he slanders thee most grossly .
Sir , I cannot .
Let them hang .
So he doth you , my lord , and said this other day you owed him a thousand pound .
What , my lord
Sirrah , do I owe you a thousand pound
Make you a wholesome answer . My wit’s diseased . But , sir , such answer as I can make , you shall command . Or , rather , as you say , my mother . Therefore no more but to the matter . My mother , you say
A thousand pound , Hal A million . Thy love is worth a million thou owest me thy love .
Then thus she says your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration .
Ay , and burn too .
Nay , my lord , he called you jack , and said he would cudgel you .
Did I , Bardolph
Indeed , Sir John , you said so .
Yea , if he said my ring was copper .
I say ’tis copper . Darest thou be as good as thy word now
Why , Hal , thou knowest , as thou art but man , I dare , but as thou art Prince , I fear thee as I fear the roaring of a lion’s whelp .
And why not as the lion
The King is to be feared as the lion . Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father Nay , an I do , I pray God my girdle break .
So please your lordship , none .
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter
Come , come , you have been too rough , something too rough You must return and mend it .
I know no news , my lord .
What paper were you reading
There’s no remedy Unless , by not so doing , our good city Cleave in the midst , and perish .
Nothing , my lord .
No What needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself . Let’s see . Come , if it be nothing , I shall not need spectacles .
I beseech you , sir , pardon me . It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o er read . And for so much as I have perused , I find it not fit for your o erlooking .
Give me the letter , sir .
I shall offend , either to detain or give it . The contents , as in part I understand them , are to blame .
Let’s see , let’s see .
I hope , for my brother’s justification , he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue .
This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times , keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them . I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny , who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered .
That , were our royal faiths martyrs in love , We shall be winnowed with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partition .
No , no , my lord . Note this the King is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances , For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no telltale to his memory That may repeat and history his loss To new remembrance . For full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion His foes are so enrooted with his friends That , plucking to unfix an enemy , He doth unfasten so and shake a friend So that this land , like an offensive wife That hath enraged him on to offer strokes , As he is striking holds his infant up And hangs resolved correction in the arm That was upreared to execution .
Besides , the King hath wasted all his rods On late offenders , that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement , So that his power , like to a fangless lion , May offer but not hold .
Tis very true , And therefore be assured , my good Lord Marshal , If we do now make our atonement well , Our peace will , like a broken limb united , Grow stronger for the breaking .
Pray , be counsell’d I have a heart as little apt as yours , But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantage .
Well said , noble woman Before he should thus stoop to the herd , but that The violent fit o’ the time craves it as physic For the whole state , I would put mine armour on , Which I can scarcely bear .
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then Poor man I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep . He were no lion were not Romans hinds . Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws . What trash is Rome , What rubbish and what offal , when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar But , O grief , Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman . Then I know My answer must be made . But I am armed , And dangers are to me indifferent .
You speak to Casca , and to such a man That is no fleering telltale . Hold , my hand . Be factious for redress of all these griefs , And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest .
There’s a bargain made . Now know you , Casca , I have moved already Some certain of the noblest minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable dangerous consequence . And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey’s porch . For now , this fearful night , There is no stir or walking in the streets , And the complexion of the element In favor’s like the work we have in hand , Most bloody , fiery , and most terrible .
O , if it should , how would thy guts fall about thy knees But , sirrah , there’s no room for faith , truth , nor honesty in this bosom of thine . It is all filled up with guts and midriff . Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket Why , thou whoreson , impudent , embossed rascal , if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings , memorandums of bawdy houses , and one poor pennyworth , of sugar candy to make thee long winded , if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these , I am a villain . And , yet you will stand to it You will not pocket up wrong Art thou not ashamed
Dost thou hear , Hal Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell , and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villany Thou seest I have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty . You confess , then , you picked my pocket
It appears so by the story .
Hostess , I forgive thee . Go make ready breakfast , love thy , husband , look to thy servants , cherish thy guests . Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason . Thou seest I am pacified still . Nay , prithee , be gone .
Now , Hal , to the news at court . For the robbery , lad , how is that answered
O , my sweet beef , I must still be good angel to thee . The money is paid back again .
O , I do not like that paying back . Tis a double labor .
God save the king .
Whence cam’st thou , worthy thane
From Fife , great king , Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold . Norway himself , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyal traitor , The thane of Cawdor , began a dismal conflict , Till that Bellona’s bridegroom , lapped in proof , Confronted him with self comparisons , Point against point , rebellious arm gainst arm , Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude , The victory fell on us .
Great happiness
That now Sweno , the Norways king , craves composition . Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use .
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest go pronounce his present death , And with his former title greet Macbeth .
I’ll see it done .
What he hath lost , noble Macbeth hath won .
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration Impart .
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .
We shall obey , were she ten times our mother . Have you any further trade with us
My lord , you once did love me .
Stand close awhile , for here comes one in haste .
And do still , by these pickers and stealers .
Tis Cinna . I do know him by his gait . He is a friend . Cinna , where haste you so
Good my lord , what is your cause of distemper You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend .
To find out you . Who’s that Metellus Cimber
Sir , I lack advancement .
No , it is Casca , one incorporate To our attempts . Am I not stayed for , Cinna
I am glad on ’t . What a fearful night is this There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights .
Am I not stayed for Tell me .
Come to me , that of this I may speak more . If our father would sleep till I waked him , you should enjoy half his revenue forever , and live the beloved of your brother , Edgar . Hum , conspiracy Sleep till I wake him , you should enjoy half his revenue my son Edgar Had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in When came this to you Who brought it
Yes , you are . O Cassius , if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party
It was not brought me , my lord . There’s the cunning of it . I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
You know the character to be your brother’s
Be you content . Good Cinna , take this paper , And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it . And throw this In at his window . Set this up with wax Upon old Brutus statue . All this done , Repair to Pompey’s porch , where you shall find us . Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
If the matter were good , my lord , I durst swear it were his . But in respect of that , I would fain think it were not .
All but Metellus Cimber , and he’s gone To seek you at your house . Well , I will hie , And so bestow these papers as you bade me .
It is his .
That done , repair to Pompey’s theatre .
It is his hand , my lord , but I hope his heart is not in the contents .
Has he never before sounded you in this business
Never , my lord . But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that , sons at perfect age and fathers declined , the father should be as ward to the son , and the son manage his revenue .
O villain , villain His very opinion in the letter Abhorred villain Unnatural , detested , brutish villain worse than
How can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark
Ay , sir , but While the grass grows The proverb is something musty Oh , the recorders Let me see one . To withdraw with you , why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil
O my lord , if my duty be too bold , my love is too unmannerly .
I am good friends with my father and may do anything .
Rob me the Exchequer the first thing thou dost , and do it with unwashed hands too .
Do , my lord .
I have procured thee , Jack , a charge of foot .
I would it had been of horse . Where shall I find one that can steal well O , for a fine thief of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts I am heinously unprovided . Well , God be thanked for these rebels . They offend none but the virtuous . I laud them I praise them .
Bardolph
My lord .
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster , To my brother John this to my Lord of Westmoreland .
Go , Peto , to horse , to horse , for thou and I have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time .
Jack , meet me tomorrow in the Temple hall At two o clock in the afternoon There shalt thou know thy charge , and there receive Money and order for their furniture . The land is burning . Percy stands on high , And either we or they must lower lie .
What must I do
Return to the tribunes .
Well , what then what then
Repent what you have spoke .
For them I cannot do it to the gods Must I then do’t to them
You are too absolute Though therein you can never be too noble , But when extremities speak . I have heard you say , Honour and policy , like unsever’d friends , I’ the war do grow together grant that , and tell me , In peace what each of them by the other lose , That they combine not there .
Tush , tush
A good demand .
If it be honour in your wars to seem The same you are not , which , for your best ends , You adopt your policy , how is it less or worse , That it shall hold companionship in peace With honour , as in war , since that to both It stands in like request
Why force you this
Be it so . Here is returned my Lord of Westmoreland .
Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people not by your own instruction , Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you , But with such words that are but rooted in Your tongue , though but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosom’s truth . Now , this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words , Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood . I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake required I should do so in honour I am in this , Your wife , your son , these senators , the nobles And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown than spend a fawn upon ’em , For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruin .
The Prince is here at hand . Pleaseth your lordship To meet his Grace just distance ’tween our armies .
Your Grace of York , in God’s name then set forward .
Before , and greet his Grace . My lord , we come .
You are well encountered here , my cousin Mowbray . Good day to you , gentle Lord Archbishop , And so to you , Lord Hastings , and to all . My Lord of York , it better showed with you When that your flock , assembled by the bell , Encircled you to hear with reverence Your exposition on the holy text Than now to see you here , an iron man talking , Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum , Turning the word to sword , and life to death . That man that sits within a monarch’s heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favor , Would he abuse the countenance of the King , Alack , what mischiefs might he set abroach In shadow of such greatness With you , Lord Bishop ,
Come , Casca , you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house . Three parts of him Is ours already , and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours .
Oh , he sits high in all the people’s hearts , And that which would appear offense in us , His countenance , like richest alchemy , Will change to virtue and to worthiness .
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited . Let us go , For it is after midnight , and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him .
I do not well understand that . Will you play upon this pipe
My lord , I cannot .
I pray you .
Believe me , I cannot .
I do beseech you .
I know no touch of it , my lord .
It is as easy as lying . Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb , give it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most eloquent music . Look you , these are the stops .
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony . I have not the skill .
Why , look you now , how unworthy a thing you make of me You would play upon me . You would seem to know my stops . You would pluck out the heart of my mystery . You would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass . And there is much music , excellent voice , in this little organ , yet cannot you make it speak Sblood , do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe Call me what instrument you will , though you can fret me , yet you cannot play upon me .
I embrace it .
How shall I know thee again
Give me any gage of thine , and I will wear it in my bonnet . Then , if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .
Here’s my glove . Give me another of thine .
There .
This will I also wear in my cap . If ever thou come to me and say , after tomorrow , This is my glove , by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear .
If ever I live to see it , I will challenge it .
Thou dar’st as well be hanged .
Well , I will do it , though I take thee in the king’s company .
Keep thy word . Fare thee well .
Be friends , you English fools , be friends . We have French quarrels enough , if you could tell how to reckon .
Noble lady Come , go with us speak fair you may salve so , Not what is dangerous present , but the loss Of what is past .
It is even so . Who hath not heard it spoken How deep you were within the books of God , To us the speaker in His parliament , To us th imagined voice of God himself , The very opener and intelligencer Between the grace , the sanctities , of heaven , And our dull workings O , who shall believe But you misuse the reverence of your place , Employ the countenance and grace of heaven As a false favorite doth his prince’s name , In deeds dishonorable You have ta en up , Under the counterfeited zeal of God , The subjects of His substitute , my father , And both against the peace of heaven and him Have here up swarmed them .
I prithee now , my son , Go to them , with this bonnet in thy hand And thus far having stretch’d it here be with them Thy knee bussing the stones for in such business Action is eloquence , and the eyes of the ignorant More learned than the ears waving thy head , Which often , thus , correcting thy stout heart , Now humble as the ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling or say to them , Thou art their soldier , and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way which , thou dost confess , Were fit for thee to use as they to claim , In asking their good loves , but thou wilt frame Thyself , forsooth , hereafter theirs , so far As thou hast power and person .
This but done , Even as she speaks , why , their hearts were yours For they have pardons , being ask’d , as free As words to little purpose .
Good my Lord of Lancaster , I am not here against your father’s peace , But , as I told my Lord of Westmoreland , The time misordered doth , in common sense , Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form To hold our safety up . I sent your Grace The parcels and particulars of our grief , The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court , Whereon this Hydra son of war is born , Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep With grant of our most just and right desires , And true obedience , of this madness cured , Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty .
If not , we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man .
And though we here fall down , We have supplies to second our attempt If they miscarry , theirs shall second them ,
Where hast thou been , sister
Killing swine .
Sister , where thou
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap , And munched , and munched , and munched . Give me , quoth I . Aroint thee , witch the rump fed runnion cries . Her husband’s to Aleppo gone , master o th Tiger But in a sieve I’ll thither sail , And like a rat without a tail , I’ll do , I’ll do , and I’ll do .
I’ll give thee a wind .
Thou rt kind .
And I another .
I myself have all the other , And the very ports they blow , All the quarters that they know I th shipman’s card . I’ll drain him dry as hay . Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid . He shall live a man forbid . Weary sev nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle , peak and pine .
Rare words , brave world Hostess , my breakfast , come . O , I could wish this tavern were my drum .
Indeed , the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders . But it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .
brutish Go , sirrah , seek him . I’ll apprehend him . Abominable villain Where is he
I do not well know , my lord . If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent , you shall run a certain course where if you violently proceed against him , mistaking his purpose , it would make a great gap in your own honor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience . I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger .
Think you so
If your honor judge it meet , I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening .
Though his bark cannot be lost , Yet it shall be tempest tossed . Look what I have .
He cannot be such a monster
Show me , show me .
Nor is not , sure .
To his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him . Heaven and earth Edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , I pray you . Frame the business after your own wisdom . I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution .
Here I have a pilot’s thumb , Wrecked as homeward he did come .
I will seek him , sir , presently , convey the business as I shall find means , and acquaint you withal .
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us . Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus , yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects . Love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide , in cities
A drum , a drum Macbeth doth come .
The weird sisters , hand in hand , Posters of the sea and land , Thus do go about , about , Thrice to thine and thrice to mine And thrice again , to make up nine . Peace The charm’s wound up .
So foul and fair a day I have not seen .
How far is ’t called to Forres What are these So withered and so wild in their attire , That look not like th inhabitants o th Earth , And yet are on ’t Live you Or are you aught That man may question You seem to understand me , By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips . You should be women , And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so .
God bless you , sir .
My lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel
By th mass , and ’tis like a camel indeed .
Methinks it is like a weasel .
It is backed like a weasel .
Or like a whale .
Very like a whale .
Then I will come to my mother by and by . They fool me to the top of my bent . I will come by and by .
I will say so .
By and by is easily said .
Leave me , friends .
Tis now the very witching time of night , When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world . Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on . Soft , now to my mother . O heart , lose not thy nature , let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom . Let me be cruel , not unnatural .
And so success of mischief shall be born , And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up Whiles England shall have generation .
You are too shallow , Hastings , much too shallow To sound the bottom of the after times .
Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles .
What , Lucius , ho I cannot by the progress of the stars Give guess how near to day . Lucius , I say I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly . When , Lucius , when Awake , I say What , Lucius
Called you , my lord
I like them all , and do allow them well , And swear here by the honor of my blood , My father’s purposes have been mistook , And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority . My lord , these griefs shall be with speed redressed Upon my soul , they shall . If this may please you , Discharge your powers unto their several counties , As we will ours , and here , between the armies , Let’s drink together friendly and embrace , That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restorèd love and amity .
Get me a taper in my study , Lucius . When it is lighted , come and call me here .
I take your princely word for these redresses .
I will , my lord .
I give it you , and will maintain my word , And thereupon I drink unto your Grace .
Go , captain , and deliver to the army This news of peace . Let them have pay , and part . I know it will well please them . Hie thee , captain .
It must be by his death , and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general . He would be crowned . How that might change his nature , there’s the question . It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking . Crown him that , And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with .
To you , my noble Lord of Westmoreland .
Well said , my noble Scot . If speaking truth In this fine age were not thought flattery , Such attribution should the Douglas have As not a soldier of this season’s stamp Should go so general current through the world . By God , I cannot flatter . I do defy The tongues of soothers . But a braver place In my heart’s love hath no man than yourself . Nay , task me to my word approve me , lord .
Thou art the king of honor . No man so potent breathes upon the ground But I will beard him .
Do so , and ’tis well .
What letters hast thou there I can but thank you .
These letters come from your father .
Letters from him Why comes he not himself
He cannot come , my lord . He is grievous sick .
Speak , if you can what are you
All hail , Macbeth Hail to thee , thane of Glamis
All hail , Macbeth Hail to thee , thane of Cawdor
All hail , Macbeth , that shalt be king hereafter
Good sir , why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair I th name of truth , Are ye fantastical , or that indeed Which outwardly ye show My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope , That he seems rapt withal . To me you speak not . If you can look into the seeds of time And say which grain will grow and which will not , Speak , then , to me , who neither beg nor fear Your favors nor your hate .
Hail
Hail
Hail
Lesser than Macbeth and greater .
Not so happy , yet much happier .
Thou shalt get kings , though thou be none . So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo
I will speak daggers to her but use none . My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites . How in my words somever she be shent , To give them seals never , my soul , consent
I pledge your Grace , and if you knew what pains I have bestowed to breed this present peace , You would drink freely . But my love to you Shall show itself more openly hereafter .
I do not doubt you .
I am glad of it . Health to my lord and gentle cousin , Mowbray .
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail
You wish me health in very happy season , For I am on the sudden something ill .
Against ill chances men are ever merry , But heaviness foreruns the good event .
Stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more . By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis . But how of Cawdor The thane of Cawdor lives , A prosperous gentleman , and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief , No more than to be Cawdor . Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence , or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting . Speak , I charge you .
Therefore be merry , coz since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus Some good thing comes tomorrow .
Believe me , I am passing light in spirit .
The earth hath bubbles , as the water has , And these are of them . Whither are they vanished
So much the worse if your own rule be true .
Into the air , and what seemed corporal Melted , as breath into the wind . Would they had stayed .
The word of peace is rendered . Hark how they shout .
Were such things here as we do speak about Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner
This had been cheerful after victory .
Your children shall be kings .
A peace is of the nature of a conquest , For then both parties nobly are subdued , And neither party loser .
You shall be king .
And thane of Cawdor too went it not so
To the selfsame tune and words . Who’s here
Zounds , how has he the leisure to be sick In such a justling time Who leads his power Under whose government come they along
His letters bear his mind , not I , my lord .
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father . This villain of mine comes under the prediction there’s son against father . The king falls from bias of nature there’s father against child . We have seen the best of our time . Machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves . Find out this villain , Edmund . It shall lose thee nothing . Do it carefully . And the noble and true hearted Kent banished , his offense honesty Tis strange , strange .
I prithee , tell me , doth he keep his bed
He did , my lord , four days ere I set forth , And , at the time of my departure thence , He was much feared by his physicians .
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behavior we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if we were villains by necessity , fools by heavenly compulsion , knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance , drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence , and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on . An admirable evasion of whoremaster man , to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major , so that it follows I am rough and lecherous . Fut , I should have been that I am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing . Edgar
I would the state of time had first been whole Ere he by sickness had been visited . His health was never better worth than now .
and pat on ’s cue he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy . My cue is villainous melancholy , with a sigh like Tom o Bedlam . Oh , these eclipses do portend these divisions Fa , sol , la , mi .
Sick now Droop now This sickness doth infect The very lifeblood of our enterprise . Tis catching hither , even to our camp . He writes me here that inward sickness And that his friends by deputation Could not so soon be drawn , nor did he think it meet To lay so dangerous and dear a trust On any soul removed but on his own Yet doth he give us bold advertisement That with our small conjunction we should on To see how fortune is disposed to us , For , as he writes , there is no quailing now , Because the King is certainly possessed Of all our purposes . What say you to it
Your father’s sickness is a maim to us .
A perilous gash , a very limb lopped off And yet , in faith , it is not . His present want Seems more than we shall find it . Were it good To set the exact wealth of all our states All at one cast To set so rich a main On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour It were not good , for therein should we read The very bottom and the soul of hope , The very list , the very utmost bound Of all our fortunes .
Th abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power . And , to speak truth of Caesar , I have not known when his affections swayed More than his reason . But ’tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder , Whereto the climber upward turns his face . But when he once attains the upmost round , He then unto the ladder turns his back , Looks in the clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend . So Caesar may . Then , lest he may , prevent . And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is , Fashion it thus that what he is , augmented , Would run to these and these extremities . And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg Which , hatched , would as his kind grow mischievous And kill him in the shell .
The taper burneth in your closet , sir . Searching the window for a flint , I found This paper , thus sealed up , and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed .
Get you to bed again . It is not day . Is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of March
I know not , sir .
Look in the calendar and bring me word .
I will , sir .
The king hath happily received , Macbeth , The news of thy success , and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels fight , His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his . Silenced with that , In viewing o er the rest o the selfsame day , He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks , Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , Strange images of death . As thick as tale Can post with post , and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense , And poured them down before him .
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks , Only to herald thee into his sight , Not pay thee .
And , for an earnest of a greater honor , He bade me , from him , call thee thane of Cawdor In which addition , hail , most worthy thane , For it is thine .
What , can the devil speak true
The thane of Cawdor lives . Why do you dress me In borrowed robes
Who was the thane lives yet , But under heavy judgment bears that life Which he deserves to lose . Whether he was combined With those of Norway , or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage , or that with both He labored in his country’s wrack , I know not But treasons capital , confessed and proved , Have overthrown him .
I like him not , nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range . Therefore prepare you . I your commission will forthwith dispatch , And he to England shall along with you . The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies .
We will ourselves provide . Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many , many bodies safe That live and feed upon your majesty .
The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armor of the mind To keep itself from noyance , but much more That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many . The cease of majesty Dies not alone , but , like a gulf , doth draw What’s near it with it . It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount , To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined , which , when it falls , Each small annexment , petty consequence , Attends the boisterous ruin . Never alone Did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
Arm you , I pray you , to this speedy voyage . For we will fetters put upon this fear , Which now goes too free footed .
Prithee now , Go , and be ruled although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower . Here is Cominius .
I have been i’ the market place and , sir , ’tis fit You make strong party , or defend yourself By calmness or by absence all’s in anger .
Go , my lord , And let our army be dischargèd too .
Only fair speech .
And , good my lord , so please you , let our trains March by us , that we may peruse the men We should have coped withal .
Go , good Lord Hastings , And ere they be dismissed , let them march by .
I trust , lords , we shall lie tonight together .
I think ’twill serve , if he Can thereto frame his spirit .
Now , cousin , wherefore stands our army still
The leaders , having charge from you to stand , Will not go off until they hear you speak .
They know their duties .
He must , and will Prithee now , say you will , and go about it .
My lord , our army is dispersed already . Like youthful steers unyoked , they take their courses East , west , north , south , or , like a school broke up , Each hurries toward his home and sporting place .
Good tidings , my Lord Hastings , for the which I do arrest thee , traitor , of high treason . And you , Lord Archbishop , and you , Lord Mowbray , Of capital treason I attach you both .
Do you not hope your children shall be kings , When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them
That , trusted home , Might yet enkindle you unto the crown , Besides the thane of Cawdor . But ’tis strange . And oftentimes , to win us to our harm , The instruments of darkness tell us truths , Win us with honest trifles , to betray ’s In deepest consequence . Cousins , a word , I pray you .
This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill , cannot be good . If ill , Why hath it given me earnest of success , Commencing in a truth I am thane of Cawdor . If good , why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs , Against the use of nature Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings .
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce Must I with base tongue give my noble heart A lie that it must bear Well , I will do’t Yet , were there but this single plot to lose , This mould of Martius , they to dust should grind it And throw’t against the wind . To the market place You have put me now to such a part which never I shall discharge to the life .
Come , come , we’ll prompt you .
Upon the king Let us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king We must bear all . O hard condition , Twin born with greatness , subject to the breath Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing . What infinite heart’s ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy And what have kings that privates have not too , Save ceremony , save general ceremony And what art thou , thou idol ceremony What kind of god art thou , that suffer’st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers What are thy rents What are thy comings in O ceremony , show me but thy worth What is thy soul of adoration Art thou aught else but place , degree , and form , Creating awe and fear in other men , Wherein thou art less happy , being feared , Than they in fearing What drink’st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , But poisoned flattery Oh , be sick , great greatness , And bid thy ceremony give thee cure Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation Will it give place to flexure and low bending Canst thou , when thou command’st the beggar’s knee , Command the health of it No , thou proud dream , That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose . I am a king that find thee , and I know Tis not the balm , the scepter , and the ball , The sword , the mace , the crown imperial , The intertissued robe of gold and pearl , The farcèd title running fore the king , The throne he sits on , nor the tide of pomp
I prithee now , sweet son , as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier , so , To have my praise for this , perform a part Thou hast not done before .
My thought , whose murder yet is but fantastical , Shakes so my single state of man That function is smothered in surmise , And nothing is but what is not .
Faith , and so we should , where now remains A sweet reversion . We may boldly spend Upon the hope of what is to come in . A comfort of retirement lives in this .
Look how our partner’s rapt .
A rendezvous , a home to fly unto , If that the devil and mischance look big Upon the maidenhead of our affairs .
If chance will have me king , why , chance may crown me Without my stir .
New honors come upon him , Like our strange garments , cleave not to their mold But with the aid of use .
But yet I would your father had been here . The quality and hair of our attempt Brooks no division . It will be thought By some that know not why he is away That wisdom , loyalty , and mere dislike Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence . And think how such an apprehension May turn the tide of fearful faction And breed a kind of question in our cause . For well you know , we of the off ring side Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament , And stop all sight holes , every loop from whence The eye of reason may pry in upon us . This absence of your father’s draws a curtain That shows the ignorant a kind of fear Before not dreamt of .
Come what come may , Time and the hour runs through the roughest day .
Worthy Macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
Give me your favor . My dull brain was wrought With things forgotten . Kind gentlemen , your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them . Let us toward the king . Think upon what hath chanced , and , at more time , The interim having weighed it , let us speak Our free hearts each to other .
Very gladly .
Till then , enough . Come , friends .
We will haste us .
My lord , he’s going to his mother’s closet . Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process . I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home . And , as you said Tis meet that some more audience than a mother Since nature makes them partial should o erhear The speech , of vantage . Fare you well , my liege . I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know .
Thanks , dear my lord .
Oh , my offence is rank . It smells to heaven . It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t , A brother’s murder . Pray can I not . Though inclination be as sharp as will , My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent , And , like a man to double business bound , I stand in pause where I shall first begin , And both neglect . What if this cursèd hand Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence And what’s in prayer but this twofold force , To be forestallèd ere we come to fall Or pardoned being down Then I’ll look up . My fault is past . But oh , what form of prayer Can serve my turn , Forgive me my foul murder
The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them . Brutus , thou sleep’st . Awake , and see thyself . Shall Rome , etc . Speak , strike , redress Brutus , thou sleep’st . Awake . Such instigations have been often dropped Where I have took them up . Shall Rome , etc . Thus must I piece it out Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe What , Rome My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was called a king . Speak , strike , redress Am I entreated To speak and strike O Rome , I make thee promise , If the redress will follow , thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus
Sir , March is wasted fifteen days .
Tis good . Go to the gate . Somebody knocks .
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar , I have not slept .
Is this proceeding just and honorable
Is your assembly so
Will you thus break your faith
I pawned thee none . I promised you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain , which , by mine honor , I will perform with a most Christian care . But for you rebels , look to taste the due Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours . Most shallowly did you these arms commence , Fondly brought here , and foolishly sent hence . Strike up our drums pursue the scattered stray . God , and not we , hath safely fought today . Some guard these traitors to the block of death , Treason’s true bed and yielder up of breath .
Is execution done on Cawdor Are not Those in commission yet returned
My liege , They are not yet come back . But I have spoke With one that saw him die , who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons , Implored your highness pardon , and set forth A deep repentance . Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it . He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle .
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face . He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust .
O worthiest cousin , The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me . Thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee . Would thou hadst less deserved , That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine Only I have left to say , More is thy due than more than all can pay .
How now , brother Edmund What serious contemplation are you in
I am thinking , brother , of a prediction I read this other day , what should follow these eclipses .
Do you busy yourself about that
I promise you , the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent , death , dearth , dissolutions of ancient amities , divisions in state , menaces and maledictions against king and nobles , needless diffidences , banishment of friends , dissipation of cohorts , nuptial breaches , and I know not what .
How long have you been a sectary astronomical
Come , come . When saw you my father last
Why , the night gone by .
Spake you with him
Ay , two hours together .
Parted you in good terms Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance
None at all .
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him . And at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure , which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay .
The service and the loyalty I owe In doing it pays itself . Your highness part Is to receive our duties , and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants , Which do but what they should , by doing everything Safe toward your love and honor .
Welcome hither . I have begun to plant thee , and will labor To make thee full of growing . Noble Banquo , That hast no less deserved , nor must be known No less to have done so , let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart .
There , if I grow , The harvest is your own .
My plenteous joys , Wanton in fullness , seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow . Sons , kinsmen , thanes , And you whose places are the nearest , know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest , Malcolm , whom we name hereafter The prince of Cumberland which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only , But signs of nobleness , like stars , shall shine On all deservers . From hence to Inverness , And bind us further to you .
The rest is labor which is not used for you I’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach . So humbly take my leave .
My worthy Cawdor
That cannot be , since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder My crown , mine own ambition , and my queen . May one be pardoned and retain th offense In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice , And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law . But ’tis not so above . There is no shuffling . There the action lies In his true nature , and we ourselves compelled , Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults , To give in evidence . What then What rests Try what repentance can . What can it not Yet what can it when one can not repent O wretched state O bosom black as death O limèd soul that , struggling to be free , Art more engaged Help , angels . Make assay . Bow , stubborn knees , and , heart with strings of steel , Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe . All may be well .
Now might I do it pat . Now he is a praying . And now I’ll do ’t . And so he goes to heaven . And so am I revenged . That would be scanned . A villain kills my father , and , for that , I , his sole son , do this same villain send To heaven . Oh , this is hire and salary , not revenge . He took my father grossly , full of bread , With all his crimes broad blown , as flush as May . And how his audit stands who knows save heaven But in our circumstance and course of thought Tis heavy with him . And am I then revenged
What’s your name , sir Of what condition are you , and of what place , I pray
I am a knight , sir , and my name is Colevile of the Dale .
Well , then , Colevile is your name , a knight is your degree , and your place the Dale . Colevile shall be still your name , a traitor your degree , and the dungeon your place , a place deep enough so shall you be still Colevile of the Dale .
Are not you Sir John Falstaff
As good a man as he , sir , whoe er I am . Do ye yield , sir , or shall I sweat for you If I do sweat , they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death . Therefore rouse up fear and trembling , and do observance to my mercy .
I think you are Sir John Falstaff , and in that thought yield me .
I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine , and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name . An I had but a belly of any indifferency , I were simply the most active fellow in Europe . My womb , my womb , my womb undoes me . Here comes our general .
The prince of Cumberland That is a step On which I must fall down , or else o erleap , For in my way it lies . Stars , hide your fires Let not light see my black and deep desires . The eye wink at the hand , yet let that be Which the eye fears , when it is done , to see .
True , worthy Banquo . He is full so valiant , And in his commendations I am fed It is a banquet to me . Let’s after him , Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome It is a peerless kinsman .
Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion , all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream . The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council , and the state of man , Like to a little kingdom , suffers then The nature of an insurrection .
Sir , ’tis your brother Cassius at the door , Who doth desire to see you .
Is he alone
No , sir , there are more with him .
Do you know them
No , sir . Their hats are plucked about their ears , And half their faces buried in their cloaks , That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor .
Let em enter .
They are the faction . O conspiracy , Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free O , then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none , conspiracy . Hide it in smiles and affability .
That beats upon the high shore of this world . No , not all these , thrice gorgeous ceremony , Not all these , laid in bed majestical , Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave , Who , with a body filled and vacant mind , Gets him to rest , crammed with distressful bread Never sees horrid night , the child of hell , But , like a lackey , from the rise to set Sweats in the eye of Phoebus , and all night Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn , Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse , And follows so the ever running year With profitable labor to his grave . And , but for ceremony , such a wretch , Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , Had the forehand and vantage of a king . The slave , a member of the country’s peace , Enjoys it , but in gross brain little wots What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace , Whose hours the peasant best advantages .
My lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , Seek through your camp to find you .
Good old knight , Collect them all together at my tent . I’ll be before thee .
I shall do’t , my lord .
You strain too far . I rather of his absence make this use It lends a luster and more great opinion , A larger dare , to our great enterprise Than if the Earl were here , for men must think If we without his help can make a head To push against a kingdom , with his help We shall o erturn it topsy turvy down . Yet all goes well , yet all our joints are whole .
As heart can think . There is not such a word Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear .
My cousin Vernon , welcome , by my soul .
Pray God my news be worth a welcome , lord . The Earl of Westmoreland , seven thousand strong , Is marching hitherwards , with him Prince John .
No harm , what more
And further I have learned , The King himself in person is set forth , Or hitherwards intended speedily , With strong and mighty preparation .
He shall be welcome too . Where is his son , The nimble footed madcap Prince of Wales , And his comrades , that daffed the world aside And bid it pass
Some villain hath done me wrong .
That’s my fear . I pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower . And as I say , retire with me to my lodging , from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak . Pray ye , go . There’s my key . If you do stir abroad , go armed .
Armed , brother
Brother , I advise you to the best . Go armed . I am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you . I have told you what I have seen and heard but faintly , nothing like the image and horror of it . Pray you , away .
Shall I hear from you anon
I do serve you in this business .
A credulous father , and a brother noble Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none , on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy . I see the business . Let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit . All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit .
To take him in the purging of his soul When he is fit and seasoned for his passage No . Up , sword , and know thou a more horrid hent . When he is drunk asleep , or in his rage , Or in th incestuous pleasure of his bed , At game a swearing , or about some act That has no relish of salvation in ’t Then trip him , that his heels may kick at heaven , And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell , whereto it goes . My mother stays This physic but prolongs thy sickly days .
My words fly up , my thoughts remain below . Words without thoughts never to heaven go .
Well , I must do’t Away , my disposition , and possess me Some harlot’s spirit my throat of war be turn’d , Which quired with my drum , into a pipe Small as an eunuch , or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks , and schoolboys’ tears take up The glasses of my sight a beggar’s tongue Make motion through my lips , and my arm’d knees , Who bow’d but in my stirrup , bend like his That hath received an alms I will not do’t , Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth And by my body’s action teach my mind A most inherent baseness .
They met me in the day of success , and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge . When I burned in desire to question them further , they made themselves air , into which they vanished . Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king , who all hailed me Thane of Cawdor , by which title , before , these weird sisters saluted me , and referred me to the coming on of time with Hail , king that shalt be This have I thought good to deliver thee , my dearest partner of greatness , that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing , by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee . Lay it to thy heart , and farewell .
At thy choice , then To beg of thee , it is my more dishonour Than thou of them . Come all to ruin let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness , for I mock at death With as big heart as thou . Do as thou list Thy valiantness was mine , thou suck’dst it from me , But owe thy pride thyself .
Pray , be content Mother , I am going to the market place Chide me no more . I’ll mountebank their loves , Cog their hearts from them , and come home beloved Of all the trades in Rome . Look , I am going Commend me to my wife . I’ll return consul Or never trust to what my tongue can do I’ the way of flattery further .
Glamis thou art , and Cawdor and shalt be What thou art promised . Yet do I fear thy nature It is too full o th milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great , Art not without ambition , but without The illness should attend it . What thou wouldst highly , That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false , And yet wouldst wrongly win . Thou ld’st have , great Glamis , That which cries , Thus thou must do , if thou have it , And that which rather thou dost fear to do , Than wishest should be undone . Hie thee hither , That I may pour my spirits in thine ear And chastise with the valor of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round , Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crowned withal .
The heat is past . Follow no further now .
Call in the powers , good cousin Westmoreland .
Now , Falstaff , where have you been all this while When everything is ended , then you come . These tardy tricks of yours will , on my life , One time or other break some gallows back .
For if thou path , thy native semblance on , Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention .
I think we are too bold upon your rest . Good morrow , Brutus . Do we trouble you
I have been up this hour , awake all night . Know I these men that come along with you
I would be sorry , my lord , but it should be thus . I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor . Do you think me a swallow , an arrow , or a bullet Have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility . I have foundered ninescore and odd posts , and here , travel tainted as I am , have in my pure and immaculate valor taken Sir John Colevile of the Dale , a most furious knight and valorous enemy . But what of that He saw me and yielded , that I may justly say , with the hook nosed fellow of Rome , There , cousin , I came , saw , and overcame .
It was more of his courtesy than your deserving .
I know not . Here he is , and here I yield him . And I beseech your Grace let it be booked with the rest of this day’s deeds , or , by the Lord , I will have it in a particular ballad else , with mine own picture on the top on ’t , Colevile kissing my foot to the which course if I be enforced , if you do not all show
All furnished , all in arms , All plumed like estridges that with the wind Baited like eagles having lately bathed , Glittering in golden coats like images , As full of spirit as the month of May , And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer , Wanton as youthful goats , wild as young bulls . I saw young Harry with his beaver on , His cuisses on his thighs , gallantly armed Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury And vaulted with such ease into his seat As if an angel dropped down from the clouds , To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus And witch the world with noble horsemanship .
Yes , every man of them , and no man here But honors you , and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you . This is Trebonius .
What is your tidings
No more , no more Worse than the sun in March This praise doth nourish agues . Let them come . They come like sacrifices in their trim , And to the fire eyed maid of smoky war All hot and bleeding will we offer them . The mailèd Mars shall on his altar sit Up to the ears in blood . I am on fire To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh And yet not ours . Come , let me taste my horse , Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales . Harry to Harry shall , hot horse to horse , Meet and ne er part till one drop down a corse . O , that Glendower were come
He is welcome hither .
There is more news . I learned in Worcester , as I rode along , He cannot draw his power this fourteen days .
The king comes here tonight .
This , Decius Brutus .
That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet .
He is welcome too .
Thou rt mad to say it . Is not thy master with him , who , were ’t so , Would have informed for preparation
This , Casca . This , Cinna . And this , Metellus Cimber .
So please you , it is true our thane is coming . One of my fellows had the speed of him , Who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Than would make up his message .
They are all welcome . What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night
Shall I entreat a word
Give him tending . He brings great news .
The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements . Come , you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts , unsex me here , And fill me from the crown to the toe top full Of direst cruelty . Make thick my blood . Stop up the access and passage to remorse , That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keep peace between The effect and it Come to my woman’s breasts , And take my milk for gall , you murd ring ministers , Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature’s mischief . Come , thick night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell , That my keen knife see not the wound it makes , Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry Hold , hold
He will come straight . Look you lay home to him . Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with , And that your grace hath screened and stood between Much heat and him . I’ll silence me even here . Pray you , be round with him .
Mother , mother , mother
I’ll warrant you . Fear me not . Withdraw , I hear him coming .
Now mother , what’s the matter
Hamlet , thou hast thy father much offended .
Mother , you have my father much offended .
Come , come , you answer with an idle tongue .
Go , go , you question with a wicked tongue .
Why , how now , Hamlet
What’s the matter now
Have you forgot me
No , by the rood , not so . You are the queen , your husband’s brother’s wife , And would it were not so you are my mother .
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool
Ay , madam .
By day and night he wrongs me . Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds . I’ll not endure it . His knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us On every trifle . When he returns from hunting , I will not speak with him . Say I am sick . If you come slack of former services , You shall do well . The fault of it I’ll answer .
He’s coming , madam . I hear him .
Put on what weary negligence you please , You and your fellow servants . I’ll have it come to question . If he distaste it , let him to our sister , Whose mind and mine I know in that are one , Not to be overruled . Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away Now by my life , Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries , when they are seen abused . Remember what I have said .
Very well , madam .
Great Glamis , worthy Cawdor , Greater than both , by the all hail hereafter , Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feel now The future in the instant .
My dearest love , Duncan comes here tonight .
And when goes hence
Tomorrow , as he purposes .
O , never Shall sun that morrow see Your face , my thane , is as a book where men May read strange matters . To beguile the time , Look like the time . Bear welcome in your eye , Your hand , your tongue . Look like th innocent flower , But be the serpent under ’t . He that’s coming Must be provided for and you shall put This night’s great business into my dispatch , Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom .
We will speak further .
Only look up clear . To alter favor ever is to fear . Leave all the rest to me .
O God of battles , steel my soldiers hearts . Possess them not with fear . Take from them now The sense of reck ning ere th opposèd numbers Pluck their hearts from them . Not today , O Lord , Oh , not today , think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown . I Richard’s body have interrèd anew , And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forcèd drops of blood . Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay , Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood . And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard’s soul . More will I do Though all that I can do is nothing worth , Since that my penitence comes after all , Imploring pardon .
My liege .
My brother Gloucester’s voice . Ay , I know thy errand . I will go with thee . The day , my friends , and all things stay for me .
Ay , by my faith , that bears a frosty sound .
What may the King’s whole battle reach unto
To thirty thousand .
Forty let it be . My father and Glendower being both away , The powers of us may serve so great a day . Come , let us take a muster speedily . Doomsday is near . Die all , die merrily .
Talk not of dying . I am out of fear Of death or death’s hand for this one half year .
And let his knights have colder looks among you . What grows of it , no matter . Advise your fellows so . I would breed from hence occasions , and I shall , That I may speak . I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course . Go , prepare for dinner .
This castle hath a pleasant seat . The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses .
This guest of summer , The temple haunting martlet , does approve , By his loved mansionry , that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here . No jutty , frieze , Buttress , nor coign of vantage , but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle . Where they most breed and haunt , I have observed , The air is delicate .
See , see , our honored hostess The love that follows us sometime is our trouble , Which still we thank as love . Herein I teach you How you shall bid God ild us for your pains , And thank us for your trouble .
Do your will .
All our service , In every point twice done and then done double , Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house . For those of old , And the late dignities heaped up to them , We rest your hermits .
Away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself To answer mildly for they are prepared With accusations , as I hear , more strong Than are upon you yet .
The word is ‘mildly . ’ Pray you , let us go Let them accuse me by invention , I Will answer in mine honour .
Ay , but mildly .
Nay , then I’ll set those to you that can speak .
Well , mildly be it then . Mildly
Come , come , and sit you down . You shall not budge . You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you .
What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murder me Help , help , ho
What , ho Help , help , help
How now , a rat Dead for a ducat , dead
Oh , I am slain .
O me , what hast thou done
Nay , I know not . Is it the king
Oh , what a rash and bloody deed is this
A bloody deed Almost as bad , good mother , As kill a king and marry with his brother .
As kill a king
Ay , lady , ’twas my word .
Where’s the thane of Cawdor We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor but he rides well , And his great love , sharp as his spur , hath holp him To his home before us . Fair and noble hostess , We are your guest tonight .
Your servants ever Have theirs , themselves , and what is theirs in compt , To make their audit at your highness pleasure , Still to return your own .
Give me your hand . Conduct me to mine host . We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him . By your leave , hostess .
Here lies the east . Doth not the day break here
No .
O , pardon , sir , it doth , and yon gray lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day .
Bardolph , get thee before to Coventry . Fill me a bottle of sack . Our soldiers shall march through . We’ll to Sutton Coldfield tonight .
Will you give me money , captain
Lay out , lay out .
This bottle makes an angel .
An if it do , take it for thy labor . An if it make twenty , take them all . I’ll answer the coinage . Bid my lieutenant Peto meet me at town’s end .
I will , captain . Farewell .
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers , I am a soused gurnet . I have misused the King’s press damnably . I have got , in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers , three hundred and odd pounds . I press me none but good householders , yeomen’s sons inquire me out contracted bachelors , such as had been asked twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum , such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck . I pressed me none but such toasts and butter , with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins heads , and
If but as well I other accents borrow , That can my speech diffuse , my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness . Now , banished Kent , If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned , So may it come thy master , whom thou lovest , Shall find thee full of labors .
Let me not stay a jot for dinner . Go get it ready .
How now , what art thou
A man , sir .
What dost thou profess What wouldst thou with us
I do profess to be no less than I seem to serve him truly that will put me in trust , to love him that is honest , to converse with him that is wise and says little , to fear judgment , to fight when I cannot choose , and to eat no fish .
What art thou
A very honest hearted fellow , and as poor as the king .
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king , thou rt poor enough . What wouldst thou
Thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell . I took thee for thy better . Take thy fortune . Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger . Leave wringing of your hands . Peace . Sit you down And let me wring your heart . For so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuff , If damnèd custom have not brassed it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense .
What have I done , that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me
If it were done when ’tis done , then ’twere well It were done quickly . If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence , and catch With his surcease success that but this blow Might be the be all and the end all here , But here , upon this bank and shoal of time , We’d jump the life to come . But in these cases We still have judgment here , that we but teach Bloody instructions , which , being taught , return To plague th inventor this even handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice To our own lips . He’s here in double trust First , as I am his kinsman and his subject , Strong both against the deed then , as his host , Who should against his murderer shut the door , Not bear the knife myself . Besides , this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek , hath been So clear in his great office , that his virtues Will plead like angels , trumpet tongued , against The deep damnation of his taking off And pity , like a naked newborn babe , Striding the blast , or heaven’s cherubim , horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air , Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye , That tears shall drown the wind . I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent , but only Vaulting ambition , which o erleaps itself And falls on th other .
Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty , Calls virtue hypocrite , takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there , makes marriage vows As false as dicers oaths oh , such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul , and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words . Heaven’s face doth glow O er this solidity and compound mass With tristful visage , as against the doom , Is thought sick at the act .
Ay me , what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index
Look here upon this picture and on this , The counterfeit presentment of two brothers . See , what a grace was seated on this brow Hyperion’s curls , the front of Jove himself , An eye like Mars to threaten and command , A station like the herald Mercury New lighted on a heaven kissing hill A combination and a form indeed Where every god did seem to set his seal
You shall confess that you are both deceived . Here , as I point my sword , the sun arises , Which is a great way growing on the south , Weighing the youthful season of the year . Some two months hence up higher toward the north He first presents his fire , and the high east Stands , as the Capitol , directly here .

And let us swear our resolution .
No , not an oath . If not the face of men , The sufferance of our souls , the time’s abuse If these be motives weak , break off betimes , And every man hence to his idle bed . So let high sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery . But if these As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged , That this shall be , or we will fall for it Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs . Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt . But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise , Nor th insuppressive mettle of our spirits , To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath , when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him .
The sun doth gild our armor . Up , my lords .
Service .
Montez à cheval My horse , varlet Lackey Ha
Who wouldst thou serve
O brave spirit
You .
Via les eaux et la terre .
Dost thou know me , fellow
Rien puis L air et feu
No , sir . But you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master .
Cieux , cousin Orléans .
What’s that
like gilt twopences to me , and I in the clear sky of fame o ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element , believe not the word of the noble . Therefore let me have right , and let desert mount .
Now , my Lord Constable
Authority .
Thine’s too heavy to mount .
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh .
What services canst thou do
Let it shine , then .
Mount them and make incision in their hides , That their hot blood may spin in English eyes And dout them with superfluous courage . Ha
I can keep honest counsel , ride , run , mar a curious tale in telling it , and deliver a plain message bluntly . That which ordinary men are fit for , I am qualified in . And the best of me is diligence .
Thine’s too thick to shine .
What , will you have them weep our horses blood How shall we then behold their natural tears
How old art thou
Let it do something , my good lord , that may do me good , and call it what you will .
Not so young , sir , to love a woman for singing , nor so old to dote on her for anything . I have years on my back forty eight .
Is thy name Colevile
It is , my lord .
Follow me . Thou shalt serve me . If I like thee no worse after dinner , I will not part from thee yet . Dinner , ho , dinner Where’s my knave , my fool Go you , and call my fool hither .
In this point charge him home , that he affects Tyrannical power if he evade us there , Enforce him with his envy to the people , And that the spoil got on the Antiates Was ne’er distributed .
A famous rebel art thou , Colevile .
And a famous true subject took him .
What , will he come
He’s coming .
I am , my lord , but as my betters are That led me hither . Had they been ruled by me , You should have won them dearer than you have .
How accompanied
I know not how they sold themselves , but thou , like a kind fellow , gavest thyself away gratis , and I thank thee for thee .
With old Menenius , and those senators That always favour’d him .
Now , have you left pursuit
Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll
I have ’tis ready .
Have you collected them by tribes
I have .
Assemble presently the people hither And when they bear me say ‘It shall be so I’ the right and strength o’ the commons , ’ be it either For death , for fine , or banishment , then let them If I say fine , cry ‘Fine ’ if death , cry ‘Death . ’ Insisting on the old prerogative And power i’ the truth o’ the cause .
they have bought out their services , and now my whole charge consists of ancients , corporals , lieutenants , gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth , where the glutton’s dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers , but discarded , unjust servingmen , younger sons to younger brothers , revolted tapsters , and ostlers tradefallen , the cankers of a calm world and a long peace , ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feazed ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services , that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine keeping , from eating draff and husks . A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies . No eye hath seen such scarecrows . I’ll not march through Coventry with them , that’s flat . Nay , and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on , for indeed I had the most of them out of prison . There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company , and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat without sleeves and the shirt , to say the truth , stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red nose innkeeper of Daventry . But that’s all one they’ll find linen enough on every hedge .
How now , blown Jack How now , quilt
How now What news
He has almost supped . Why have you left the chamber
Hath he asked for me
Know you not he has
To give the world assurance of a man . This was your husband . Look you now , what follows . Here is your husband , like a mildewed ear Blasting his wholesome brother . Have you eyes Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this moor Ha , have you eyes You cannot call it love , for at your age The heyday in the blood is tame , it’s humble , And waits upon the judgment . And what judgment Would step from this to this Sense sure you have , Else could you not have motion . But sure that sense Is apoplexed , for madness would not err , Nor sense to ecstasy was ne er so thralled , But it reserved some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference . What devil was ’t That thus hath cozened you at hoodman blind Eyes without feeling , feeling without sight , Ears without hands or eyes , smelling sans all , Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope . O shame , where is thy blush Rebellious hell , If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones , To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire . Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardor gives the charge , Since frost itself as actively doth burn , And reason panders will .
We will proceed no further in this business . He hath honored me of late , and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worn now in their newest gloss , Not cast aside so soon .
O Hamlet , speak no more Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul , And there I see such black and grainèd spots As will not leave their tinct .
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself Hath it slept since And wakes it now , to look so green and pale At what it did so freely From this time Such I account thy love . Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life , And live a coward in thine own esteem , Letting I dare not wait upon I would , Like the poor cat i th adage
Nay , but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed , Stewed in corruption , honeying and making love Over the nasty sty
Prithee , peace I dare do all that may become a man Who dares do more is none .
What beast was ’t , then , That made you break this enterprise to me When you durst do it , then you were a man And to be more than what you were , you would Be so much more the man . Nor time nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both . They have made themselves , and that their fitness now Does unmake you . I have given suck , and know How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me . I would , while it was smiling in my face , Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums And dashed the brains out , had I so sworn as you Have done to this .
But what of Cicero Shall we sound him I think he will stand very strong with us .
You , you , sirrah , where’s my daughter
So please you
What says the fellow there Call the clotpoll back .
Where’s my fool , ho I think the world’s asleep .
How now Where’s that mongrel
He says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him .
Sir , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not .
Let us not leave him out .
He would not
No , by no means .
My lord , I know not what the matter is , but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont . There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also , and your daughter .
O , let us have him , for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds . It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands . Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear , But all be buried in his gravity .
Ha Sayest thou so
O , name him not . Let us not break with him , For he will never follow anything That other men begin .
I beseech you pardon me , my lord , if I be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged .
Then leave him out .
If we should fail
We fail But screw your courage to the sticking place , And we’ll not fail . When Duncan is asleep Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey Soundly invite him his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory , the warder of the brain , Shall be a fume , and the receipt of reason A limbeck only when in swinish sleep Their drenchèd natures lie as in a death , What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan What not put upon His spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell
Bring forth men children only , For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males . Will it not be received , When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers , That they have done ’t
I shall inform them .
And when such time they have begun to cry , Let them not cease , but with a din confused Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentence .
Retreat is made and execution stayed .
Very well .
Send Colevile with his confederates To York , to present execution . Blunt , lead him hence , and see you guard him sure .
Make them be strong and ready for this hint , When we shall hap to give ’t them .
Go about it .
And now dispatch we toward the court , my lords . I hear the King my father is sore sick . Our news shall go before us to his Majesty , Which , cousin , you shall bear to comfort him , And we with sober speed will follow you .
My lord , I beseech you give me leave to go through Gloucestershire , and , when you come to court , stand my good lord , pray , in your good report .
Put him to choler straight he hath been used Ever to conquer , and to have his worth Of contradiction being once chafed , he cannot Be rein’d again to temperance then he speaks What’s in his heart and that is there which looks With us to break his neck .
Fare you well , Falstaff . I , in my condition , Shall better speak of you than you deserve .
Well , here he comes .
Calmly , I do beseech you .
I would you had but the wit ’twere better than your dukedom . Good faith , this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me , nor a man cannot make him laugh . But that’s no marvel he drinks no wine . There’s never none of these demure boys come to any proof , for thin drink doth so overcool their blood , and making many fish meals , that they fall into a kind of male green sickness , and then , when they marry , they get wenches . They are generally fools and cowards , which some of us should be too , but for inflammation .
Ay , as an ostler , that for the poorest piece Will bear the knave by the volume . The honour’d gods Keep Rome in safety , and the chairs of justice Supplied with worthy men plant love among ’s Throng our large temples with the shows of peace , And not our streets with war
What , Hal , how now , mad wag What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire My good Lord of Westmoreland , I cry you mercy I thought your Honor had already been at Shrewsbury .
Faith , Sir John , ’tis more than time that I were there and you too , but my powers are there already . The King , I can tell you , looks for us all . We must away all night .
Tut , never fear me . I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream .
I think to steal cream indeed , for thy theft hath already made thee butter . But tell me , Jack , whose fellows are these that come after
Mine , Hal , mine .
I did never see such pitiful rascals .
Tut , tut , good enough to toss food for powder , food for powder . They’ll fill a pit as well as better . Tush , man , mortal men , mortal men .
Ay , but , Sir John , methinks they are exceeding poor and bare , too beggarly .
Faith , for their poverty , I know not where they had that , and for their bareness , I am sure they never learned that of me .
No , I’ll be sworn , unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare . But , sirrah , make haste . Percy is already in the field .
Who dares receive it other , As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar Upon his death
I am settled , and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat . Away , and mock the time with fairest show . False face must hide what the false heart doth know .
The English are embattled , you French peers .
To horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse . Do but behold yond poor and starvèd band , And your fair show shall suck away their souls , Leaving them but the shales and husks of men . There is not work enough for all our hands , Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins To give each naked curtal axe a stain , That our French gallants shall today draw out And sheathe for lack of sport . Let us but blow on them , The vapor of our valor will o erturn them . Tis positive against all exceptions , lords , That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants , Who in unnecessary action swarm About our squares of battle , were enough To purge this field of such a hilding foe , Though we upon this mountain’s basis by Took stand for idle speculation , But that our honors must not . What’s to say A very little little let us do , And all is done . Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount , For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield .
Why do you stay so long , my lords of France Yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , Ill favoredly become the morning field . Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose , And our air shakes them passing scornfully . Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception . I have perceived a most faint neglect of late , which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness . I will look further into ’t . But where’s my fool I have not seen him this two days .
Since my young lady’s going into France , sir , the fool hath much pined away .
No more of that . I have noted it well . Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her .
Go you , call hither my fool .
O you sir , you , come you hither , sir . Who am I , sir
My lady’s father .
My lady’s father My lord’s knave , your whoreson dog You slave , you cur
I am none of these , my lord . I beseech your pardon .
Do you bandy looks with me , you rascal
I’ll not be strucken , my lord .
Nor tripped neither , you base football player .
How goes the night , boy
The moon is down . I have not heard the clock .
And she goes down at twelve .
I take ’t ’tis later , sir .
Amen , amen .
A noble wish .
Hold , take my sword . There’s husbandry in heaven Their candles are all out . Take thee that too . A heavy summons lies like lead upon me , And yet I would not sleep . Merciful powers , Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose .
Draw near , ye people .
Give me my sword . Who’s there
A good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it . It ascends me into the brain , dries me there all the foolish and dull and crury vapors which environ it , makes it apprehensive , quick , forgetive , full of nimble , fiery , and delectable shapes , which , delivered o er to the voice , the tongue , which is the birth , becomes excellent wit . The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood , which , before cold and settled , left the liver white and pale , which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice . But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes . It illumineth the face , which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom , man , to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain , the heart , who , great and puffed up with this retinue , doth any deed of courage , and this valor comes of sherris . So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack , for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use . Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant , for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath , like lean , sterile , and bare land , manured , husbanded , and tilled with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris , that he is become very hot and valiant . If I had a thousand sons , the first human principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack .
List to your tribunes . Audience peace , I say
A friend .
How now , Bardolph
First , hear me speak .
What , sir , not yet at rest The king’s a bed . He hath been in unusual pleasure , and Sent forth great largess to your offices . This diamond he greets your wife withal , By the name of most kind hostess , and shut up In measureless content .
Well , say . Peace , ho
Being unprepared , Our will became the servant to defect , Which else should free have wrought .
Shall I be charged no further than this present Must all determine here
I do demand , If you submit you to the people’s voices , Allow their officers and are content To suffer lawful censure for such faults As shall be proved upon you
I am content .
Lo , citizens , he says he is content The warlike service he has done , consider think Upon the wounds his body bears , which show Like graves i’ the holy churchyard .
Scratches with briers , Scars to move laughter only .
Consider further , That when he speaks not like a citizen , You find him like a soldier do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds , But , as I say , such as become a soldier , Rather than envy you .
What , is the King encamped
O , speak to me no more These words like daggers enter in my ears . No more , sweet Hamlet .
He is , Sir John . I fear we shall stay too long .
Well , To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest .
A murderer and a villain , A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord , a vice of kings , A cutpurse of the empire and the rule , That from a shelf the precious diadem stole , And put it in his pocket
No more
A king of shreds and patches
Save me and hover o er me with your wings , You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure
Alas , he’s mad
Indeed he is not fit .
Do you not come your tardy son to chide , That , lapsed in time and passion , lets go by The important acting of your dread command O , say
Shall no man else be touched but only Caesar
Decius , well urged . I think it is not meet Mark Antony , so well beloved of Caesar , Should outlive Caesar . We shall find of him A shrewd contriver . And , you know , his means , If he improve them , may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together .
Do not forget . This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose . But look , amazement on thy mother sits . O , step between her and her fighting soul . Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works . Speak to her , Hamlet .
All’s well . I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters To you they have showed some truth .
I think not of them . Yet , when we can entreat an hour to serve , We would spend it in some words upon that business , If you would grant the time .
At your kind’st leisure .
If you shall cleave to my consent , when ’tis , It shall make honor for you .
So I lose none In seeking to augment it , but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear , I shall be counselled .
Good repose the while
Thanks , sir the like to you
Go bid thy mistress , when my drink is ready , She strike upon the bell . Get thee to bed .
Is this a dagger which I see before me , The handle toward my hand Come , let me clutch thee . I have thee not , and yet I see thee still . Art thou not , fatal vision , sensible To feeling as to sight Or art thou but A dagger of the mind , a false creation , Proceeding from the heat oppressèd brain I see thee yet , in form as palpable As this which now I draw . Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going , And such an instrument I was to use . Mine eyes are made the fools o th other senses , Or else worth all the rest . I see thee still , And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood , Which was not so before . There’s no such thing . It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes . Now o er the one half world Nature seems dead , and wicked dreams abuse The curtained sleep . Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate’s offerings , and withered murder , Alarumed by his sentinel , the wolf , Whose howl’s his watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquin’s ravishing strides , towards his design Moves like a ghost . Thou sure and firm set earth , Hear not my steps , which way they walk , for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout , And take the present horror from the time , Which now suits with it . Whiles I threat , he lives . Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives .
Our course will seem too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the head off and then hack the limbs , Like wrath in death and envy afterwards , For Antony is but a limb of Caesar . Let us be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius . We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar , And in the spirit of men there is no blood . Oh , that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit And not dismember Caesar But , alas , Caesar must bleed for it . And , gentle friends , Let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully . Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods , Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds . And let our hearts , as subtle masters do , Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide em . This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious , Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be called purgers , not murderers . And for Mark Antony , think not of him , For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm When Caesar’s head is off .
I thank thee , fellow . Thou servest me , and I’ll love thee .
Come , sir , arise , away I’ll teach you differences . Away , away . If you will measure your lubber’s length again , tarry . But away , go to . Have you wisdom So .
The army is discharged all and gone .
Now , my friendly knave , I thank thee .
Let them go . I’ll through Gloucestershire , and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow , Esquire . I have him already temp ring between my finger and my thumb , and shortly will I seal with him . Come away .
Well , well , no more .
I go , and it is done . The bell invites me . Hear it not , Duncan , for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell .
What is the matter That being pass’d for consul with full voice , I am so dishonour’d that the very hour You take it off again
Answer to us .
Say , then ’tis true , I ought so .
We charge you , that you have contrived to take From Rome all season’d office and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical For which you are a traitor to the people .
How traitor
Nay , temperately your promise .
The fires i’ the lowest hell fold in the people Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths , In thy hand clutch’d as many millions , in Thy lying tongue both numbers , I would say ‘Thou liest’ unto thee with a voice as free As I do pray the gods .
Mark you this , people
We’ll fight with him tonight .
To the rock , to the rock with him
It may not be .
You give him then advantage .
Peace We need not put new matter to his charge What you have seen him do and heard him speak , Beating your officers , cursing yourselves , Opposing laws with strokes and here defying Those whose great power must try him even this , So criminal and in such capital kind , Deserves the extremest death .
Not a whit .
Why say you so Looks he not for supply
So do we .
His is certain ours is doubtful .
How is it with you , lady
Good cousin , be advised . Stir not tonight .
Alas , how is ’t with you , That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with th incorporal air do hold discourse Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep , And , as the sleeping soldiers in th alarm , Your bedded hair , like life in excrements , Starts up and stands on end . O gentle son , Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience . Whereon do you look
Do not , my lord .
There’s earnest of thy service .
You do not counsel well . You speak it out of fear and cold heart .
On him , on him Look you , how pale he glares His form and cause conjoined , preaching to stones , Would make them capable . Do not look upon me , Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects . Then what I have to do Will want true color tears perchance for blood .
Let me hire him too . Here’s my coxcomb .
To whom do you speak this
Do me no slander , Douglas . By my life , If well respected honor bid me on , I hold as little counsel with weak fear As you , my lord , or any Scot that this day lives . Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle Which of us fears .
How now , my pretty knave How dost thou
Do you see nothing there
Yea , or tonight .
Sirrah , you were best take my coxcomb .
Nothing at all , yet all that is I see .
Why , Fool
Nor did you nothing hear
Why For taking one’s part that’s out of favor . Nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou lt catch cold shortly . There , take my coxcomb . Why , this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters , and did the third a blessing against his will . If thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb . How now , nuncle Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters .
No , nothing but ourselves .
Why , look you there Look how it steals away My father , in his habit as he lived Look where he goes , even now , out at the portal
The horsemen sit like fixèd candlesticks With torch staves in their hand , and their poor jades Lob down their heads , dropping the hides and hips , The gum down roping from their pale dead eyes , And in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit Lies foul with chawed grass , still and motionless . And their executors , the knavish crows , Fly o er them all , impatient for their hour . Description cannot suit itself in words To demonstrate the life of such a battle In life so lifeless , as it shows itself .
They have said their prayers , and they stay for death .
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits , And give their fasting horses provender , And after fight with them
I stay but for my guard . On , to the field I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste . Come , come away . The sun is high , and we outwear the day .
Yet I fear him . For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold . What hath quenched them hath given me fire . Hark Peace It was the owl that shrieked , the fatal bellman , Which gives the stern’st good night . He is about it . The doors are open , and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores . I have drugged their possets , That death and nature do contend about them , Whether they live or die .
Who’s there What , ho
Alas , good Cassius , do not think of him . If he love Caesar , all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar . And that were much he should , for he is given To sports , to wildness and much company .
There is no fear in him . Let him not die , For he will live and laugh at this hereafter .
Alack , I am afraid they have awaked , And ’tis not done . Th attempt and not the deed Confounds us . Hark I laid their daggers ready He could not miss em . Had he not resembled My father as he slept , I had done ’t .
Peace Count the clock .
My husband
I have done the deed . Didst thou not hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry . Did not you speak
The clock hath stricken three .
Tis time to part .
When
But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no . For he is superstitious grown of late , Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy , of dreams and ceremonies . It may be , these apparent prodigies , The unaccustomed terror of this night , And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today .
Never fear that . If he be so resolved , I can o ersway him . For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees , And bears with glasses , elephants with holes , Lions with toils , and men with flatterers . But when I tell him he hates flatterers , He says he does , being then most flatterèd . Let me work . For I can give his humor the true bent , And I will bring him to the Capitol .
Why , my boy
If I gave them all my living , I’d keep my coxcombs myself . There’s mine . Beg another of thy daughters .
Take heed , sirrah the whip .
Truth’s a dog that must to kennel . He must be whipped out , when Lady Brach may stand by th fire and stink .
A pestilent gall to me
Sirrah , I’ll teach thee a speech .
Do .
Mark it , nuncle . Have more than thou showest , Speak less than thou knowest , Lend less than thou owest , Ride more than thou goest , Learn more than thou trowest , Set less than thou throwest , Leave thy drink and thy whore And keep in a door , And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score .
This is nothing , Fool .
Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer . You gave me nothing for ’t . Can you make no use of nothing , nuncle
Now , lords , if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors , We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified . Our navy is addressed , our power collected , Our substitutes in absence well invested , And everything lies level to our wish . Only we want a little personal strength And pause us till these rebels now afoot Come underneath the yoke of government .
Both which we doubt not but your Majesty Shall soon enjoy .
Humphrey , my son of Gloucester , Where is the Prince your brother
I think he’s gone to hunt , my lord , at Windsor .
And how accompanied
I do not know , my lord .
Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him
No , my good lord , he is in presence here .
What would my lord and father
Nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
By the eighth hour . Is that the uttermost
Be that the uttermost , and fail not then .
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey . I wonder none of you have thought of him .
Now , good Metellus , go along by him . He loves me well , and I have given him reasons . Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him .
The morning comes upon ’s . We’ll leave you , Brutus . And , friends , disperse yourselves . But all remember What you have said , and show yourselves true Romans .
Good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily . Let not our looks put on our purposes , But bear it as our Roman actors do , With untired spirits and formal constancy . And so good morrow to you every one .
Where is the king
The king himself is rode to view their battle .
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand .
There’s five to one . Besides , they all are fresh .
Why no , boy . Nothing can be made out of nothing .
God’s arm strike with us Tis a fearful odds . God be wi you , princes all . I’ll to my charge . If we no more meet till we meet in heaven , Then joyfully , my noble Lord of Bedford , My dear Lord Gloucester , and my good Lord Exeter , And my kind kinsman , warriors all , adieu .
Prithee , tell him so much the rent of his land comes to . He will not believe a fool .
Farewell , good Salisbury , and good luck go with thee .
A bitter fool .
Farewell , kind lord . Fight valiantly today . And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it , For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor .
Dost thou know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool
He is as full of valor as of kindness , Princely in both .
No , lad . Teach me .
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land , Come place him here by me . Do thou for him stand . The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear The one in motley here , The other found out there .
Dost thou call me fool , boy
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with .
This is not altogether fool , my lord .
No , faith , lords and great men will not let me . If I had a monopoly out , they would have part on ’t . And ladies too they will not let me have all fool to myself they’ll be snatching . Give me an egg , nuncle , and I’ll give thee two crowns .
Now .
As I descended
Ay .
Hark Who lies i th second chamber
Donalbain .
This is a sorry sight .
A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep , and one cried . Murder That they did wake each other . I stood and heard them . But they did say their prayers , and addressed them Again to sleep .
There are two lodged together .
One cried , God bless us and Amen the other , As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands . List ning their fear I could not say Amen , When they did say God bless us
Consider it not so deeply .
But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen I had most need of blessing , and Amen Stuck in my throat .
These deeds must not be thought After these ways . So , it will make us mad .
But since he hath Served well for Rome ,
What do you prate of service
I talk of that , that know it .
You
This the very coinage of your brain . This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in .
Is this the promise that you made your mother
Know , I pray you ,
Ecstasy My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music . It is not madness That I have uttered . Bring me to the test , And I the matter will reword , which madness Would gambol from . Mother , for love of grace , Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks . It will but skin and film the ulcerous place Whilst rank corruption , mining all within , Infects unseen . Confess yourself to heaven . Repent what’s past . Avoid what is to come . And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker . Forgive me this my virtue , For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg , Yea , curb and woo for leave to do him good .
I know no further Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death , Vagabond exile , raying , pent to linger But with a grain a day , I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word Nor cheque my courage for what they can give , To have’t with saying ‘Good morrow . ’
O Hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
For that he has , As much as in him lies , from time to time Envied against the people , seeking means To pluck away their power , as now at last Given hostile strokes , and that not in the presence Of dreaded justice , but on the ministers That do distribute it in the name o’ the people And in the power of us the tribunes , we , Even from this instant , banish him our city , In peril of precipitation From off the rock Tarpeian never more To enter our Rome gates i’ the people’s name , I say it shall be so .
Oh , throw away the worser part of it , And live the purer with the other half . Good night but go not to mine uncle’s bed . Assume a virtue if you have it not . That monster , custom , who all sense doth eat , Of habits devil , is angel yet in this That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on . Refrain tonight , And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence , the next more easy .
Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter . Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber . Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies , Which busy care draws in the brains of men . Therefore thou sleep’st so sound .
Brutus , my lord .
Portia , what mean you Wherefore rise you now It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .
Nor for yours neither . Y have ungently , Brutus , Stole from my bed . And yesternight , at supper , You suddenly arose and walked about , Musing and sighing , with your arms across , And when I asked you what the matter was , You stared upon me with ungentle looks . I urged you further , then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot . Yet I insisted yet you answered not , But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you . So I did , Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemed too much enkindled , and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor , Which sometime hath his hour with every man . It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep , And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevailed on your condition , I should not know you , Brutus . Dear my lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
Content .
Tonight , say I .
Come , come it nay not be . I wonder much , Being men of such great leading as you are , That you foresee not what impediments Drag back our expedition . Certain horse Of my cousin Vernon’s are not yet come up . Your Uncle Worcester’s horse came but today , And now their pride and mettle is asleep , Their courage with hard labor tame and dull , That not a horse is half the half of himself .
So are the horses of the enemy In general journey bated and brought low . The better part of ours are full of rest .
The number of the King exceedeth ours . For God’s sake , cousin , stay till all come in .
I come with gracious offers from the King , If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect .
Welcome , Sir Walter Blunt , and would to God You were of our determination . Some of us love you well , and even those some Envy your great deservings and good name Because you are not of our quality But stand against us like an enemy .
Nothing but well to thee , Thomas of Clarence . How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother He loves thee , and thou dost neglect him , Thomas . Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers . Cherish it , my boy , And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation , after I am dead , Between his greatness and thy other brethren . Therefore omit him not blunt not his love , Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will . For he is gracious if he be observed He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity Yet notwithstanding , being incensed he is flint , As humorous as winter , and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day . His temper therefore must be well observed . Chide him for faults , and do it reverently , When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth But , being moody , give him time and scope Till that his passions , like a whale on ground , Confound themselves with working . Learn this , Thomas , And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends , A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in , That the united vessel of their blood , Mingled with venom of suggestion , Shall never leak , though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowder .
I shall observe him with all care and love .
Why art thou not at Windsor with him , Thomas
I am not well in health , and that is all .
Oh , that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today .
Brutus is wise , and were he not in health , He would embrace the means to come by it .
Why , so I do . Good Portia , go to bed .
What’s he that wishes so My cousin Westmoreland No , my fair cousin . If we are marked to die , we are enough To do our country loss and if to live , The fewer men , the greater share of honor . God’s will , I pray thee wish not one man more . By Jove , I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost It yearns me not if men my garments wear Such outward things dwell not in my desires . But if it be a sin to covet honor , I am the most offending soul alive . No , faith , my coz , wish not a man from England . God’s peace , I would not lose so great an honor As one man more , methinks , would share from me , For the best hope I have . Oh , do not wish one more Rather proclaim it , Westmoreland , through my host , That he which hath no stomach to this fight , Let him depart . His passport shall be made , And crowns for convoy put into his purse . We would not die in that man’s company That fears his fellowship to die with us . This day is called the feast of Crispian . He that outlives this day and comes safe home , Will stand o tiptoe when the day is named And rouse him at the name of Crispian . He that shall see this day , and live old age , Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors And say , Tomorrow is Saint Crispian . Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars , And say , These wounds I had on Crispin’s day .
Is Brutus sick And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning What , is Brutus sick , And will he steal out of his wholesome bed , To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air To add unto his sickness No , my Brutus . You have some sick offense within your mind , Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of . And upon my knees I charm you , by my once commended beauty , By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me , your self , your half , Why you are heavy , and what men tonight Have had to resort to you . For here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness .
Kneel not , gentle Portia .
I should not need if you were gentle , Brutus . Within the bond of marriage , tell me , Brutus , Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you Am I yourself But , as it were , in sort or limitation , To keep with you at meals , comfort your bed , And talk to you sometimes
For use almost can change the stamp of nature , And either rein the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency . Once more , good night , And when you are desirous to be blessed , I’ll blessing beg of you . For this same lord , I do repent . But heaven hath pleased it so , To punish me with this and this with me , That I must be their scourge and minister . I will bestow him and will answer well The death I gave him . So , again , good night . I must be cruel only to be kind . Thus bad begins and worse remains behind . One word more , good lady
What shall I do
Not this , by no means , that I bid you do Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed , Pinch wanton on your cheek , call you his mouse , And let him , for a pair of reechy kisses Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers , Make you to ravel all this matter out That I essentially am not in madness But mad in craft . Twere good you let him know , For who that’s but a queen , fair , sober , wise , Would from a paddock , from a bat , a gib , Such dear concernings hide Who would do so No , in despite of sense and secrecy , Unpeg the basket on the house’s top . Let the birds fly , and like the famous ape , To try conclusions , in the basket creep And break your own neck down .
Be thou assured , if words be made of breath And breath of life , I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me .
What two crowns shall they be
Why after I have cut the egg i th middle and eat up the meat the two crowns of the egg . When thou clovest thy crown i th middle , and gavest away both parts , thou borest thy ass o th back o er the dirt . Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away . If I speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so . Fools had ne er less wit in a year , For wise men are grown foppish . They know not how their wits to wear , Their manners are so apish .
When were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah
I have used it , nuncle , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers . For when thou gavest them the rod , and put’st down thine own breeches , Then they for sudden joy did weep And I for sorrow sung , That such a king should play bo peep And go the fools among . Prithee , nuncle , keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie . I would fain learn to lie .
An you lie , sirrah , we’ll have you whipped .
Methought I heard a voice cry , Sleep no more Macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep , Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care , The death of each day’s life , sore labor’s bath , Balm of hurt minds , great nature’s second course , Chief nourisher in life’s feast .
What do you mean
Still it cried , Sleep no more to all the house . Glamis hath murdered sleep , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more . Macbeth shall sleep no more .
Who was it that thus cried Why , worthy thane , You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things . Go get some water , And wash this filthy witness from your hand . Why did you bring these daggers from the place They must lie there . Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood .
I’ll go no more I am afraid to think what I have done Look on ’t again I dare not .
Infirm of purpose Give me the daggers . The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures . Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil . If he do bleed , I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal , For it must seem their guilt .
Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure If it be no more , Portia is Brutus harlot , not his wife .
You are my true and honorable wife , As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart .
If this were true , then should I know this secret . I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife . I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman well reputed , Cato’s daughter . Think you I am no stronger than my sex , Being so fathered and so husbanded Tell me your counsels . I will not disclose em . I have made strong proof of my constancy , Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh . Can I bear that with patience , And not my husband’s secrets
O ye gods , Render me worthy of this noble wife
Hark , hark One knocks . Portia , go in awhile . And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart . All my engagements I will construe to thee , All the charactery of my sad brows . Leave me with haste .
Lucius , who’s that knocking
He is not there today he dines in London .
It shall be so , it shall be so let him away He’s banish’d , and it shall be so .
And how accompanied Canst thou tell that
Hear me , my masters , and my common friends ,
With Poins and other his continual followers .
He’s sentenced no more hearing .
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds , And he , the noble image of my youth , Is overspread with them therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death . The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape , In forms imaginary , th unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors . For when his headstrong riot hath no curb , When rage and hot blood are his counsellors , When means and lavish manners meet together , O , with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and opposed decay
Let me speak I have been consul , and can show for Rome Her enemies’ marks upon me . I do love My country’s good with a respect more tender , More holy and profound , than mine own life , My dear wife’s estimate , her womb’s increase , And treasure of my loins then if I would Speak that ,
We know your drift speak what
There’s no more to be said , but he is banish’d , As enemy to the people and his country It shall be so .
It shall be so , it shall be so .
You common cry of curs whose breath I hate As reek o’ the rotten fens , whose loves I prize As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air , I banish you And here remain with your uncertainty Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts Your enemies , with nodding of their plumes , Fan you into despair Have the power still To banish your defenders till at length Your ignorance , which finds not till it feels , Making not reservation of yourselves , Still your own foes , deliver you as most Abated captives to some nation That won you without blows Despising , For you , the city , thus I turn my back There is a world elsewhere .
And God defend but still I should stand so , So long as out of limit and true rule You stand against anointed majesty . But to my charge . The king hath sent to know The nature of your griefs , and whereupon You conjure from the breast of civil peace Such bold hostility , teaching his duteous land Audacious cruelty . If that the king Have any way your good deserts forgot , Which he confesseth to be manifold , He bids you name your griefs , and with all speed You shall have your desires with interest And pardon absolute for yourself and these Herein misled by your suggestion .
The king is kind , and well we know the king Knows at what time to promise , when to pay . My father and my uncle and myself Did give him that same royalty he wears , And when he was not six and twenty strong , Sick in the world’s regard , wretched and low , A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home , My father gave him welcome to the shore And when he heard him swear and vow to God He came but to be Duke of Lancaster , To sue his livery , and beg his peace , With tears of innocency and terms of zeal , My father , in kind heart and pity moved , Swore him assistance and performed it too . Now when the lords and barons of the realm Perceived Northumberland did lean to him , The more and less came in with cap and knee , Met him in boroughs , cities , villages , Attended him on bridges , stood in lanes , Laid gifts before him , proffered him their oaths , Gave him their heirs as pages , followed him Even at the heels in golden multitudes . He presently , as greatness knows itself , Steps me a little higher than his vow Made to my father while his blood was poor Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh , And now forsooth takes on him to reform Some certain edicts and some strait decrees That lie too heavy on the commonwealth , Cries out upon abuses , seems to weep Over his country’s wrongs , and by this face , This seeming brow of justice , did he win The hearts of all that he did angle for , Proceeded further cut me off the heads Of all the favourites that the absent King In deputation left behind him here When he was personal in the Irish war .
Old men forget yet all shall be forgot But he’ll remember with advantages What feats he did that day . Then shall our names , Familiar in his mouth as household words , Harry the King , Bedford and Exeter , Warwick and Talbot , Salisbury and Gloucester , Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered . This story shall the good man teach his son , And Crispin Crispian shall ne er go by , From this day to the ending of the world , But we in it shall be rememberèd We few , we happy few , we band of brothers For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother be he ne er so vile , This day shall gentle his condition And gentlemen in England now abed Shall think themselves accursed they were not here , And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day .
My gracious lord , you look beyond him quite . The Prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue , wherein , to gain the language , Tis needful that the most immodest word Be looked upon and learned which , once attained , Your Highness knows , comes to no further use But to be known and hated . So , like gross terms , The Prince will , in the perfectness of time , Cast off his followers , and their memory Shall as a pattern or a measure live , By which his Grace must mete the lives of others , Turning past evils to advantages .
Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb In the dead carrion .
My sovereign lord , bestow yourself with speed . The French are bravely in their battles set , And will with all expedience charge on us .
All things are ready if our minds be so .
Perish the man whose mind is backward now
Thou dost not wish more help from England , coz
God’s will , my liege , would you and I alone , Without more help , could fight this royal battle
Whence is that knocking How is ’t with me when every noise appals me What hands are here Ha They pluck out mine eyes . Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand No , this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine , Making the green one red .
My hands are of your color , but I shame To wear a heart so white .
I hear a knocking At the south entry . Retire we to our chamber . A little water clears us of this deed . How easy is it , then Your constancy Hath left you unattended .
Hark More knocking . Get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers . Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts .
To know my deed , ’twere best not know myself .
Wake Duncan with thy knocking . I would thou couldst .
Here’s a knocking indeed If a man were porter of hell gate , he should have old turning the key .
Knock , knock , knock Who’s there , i th name of Beelzebub Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty . Come in time , have napkins enough about you , here you’ll sweat for ’t .
The people’s enemy is gone , is gone
Knock , knock Who’s there , in th other devil’s name Faith , here’s an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale , who committed treason enough for God’s sake , yet could not equivocate to heaven . O , come in , equivocator .
Our enemy is banish’d he is gone Hoo hoo
Knock , knock , knock Who’s there Faith , here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose . Come in , tailor . Here you may roast your goose .
Go , see him out at gates , and follow him , As he hath followed you , with all despite Give him deserved vexation . Let a guard Attend us through the city .
Come , come let’s see him out at gates come . The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come .
He is a sick man that would speak with you .
Caius Ligarius , that Metellus spake of . Boy , stand aside . Caius Ligarius , how
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue .
O , what a time have you chose out , brave Caius , To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor .
Such an exploit have I in hand , Ligarius , Had you a healthful ear to hear of it .
By all the gods that Romans bow before , I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome , Brave son derived from honorable loins , Thou , like an exorcist , hast conjured up My mortifièd spirit . Now bid me run , And I will strive with things impossible , Yea , get the better of them . What’s to do
A piece of work that will make sick men whole .
But are not some whole that we must make sick
That must we also . What it is , my Caius , I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done .
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are . They’ll have me whipped for speaking true , thou lt have me whipped for lying , and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace . I had rather be any kind o thing than a fool . And yet I would not be thee , nuncle . Thou hast pared thy wit o both sides and left nothing i th middle . Here comes one o the parings .
How now , daughter What makes that frontlet on Methinks you are too much of late i th frown .
That’s a shelled peascod .
Who’s here Westmoreland
Health to my sovereign , and new happiness Added to that that I am to deliver . Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace’s hand . Mowbray , the Bishop Scroop , Hastings , and all Are brought to the correction of your law . There is not now a rebel’s sword unsheathed But peace puts forth her olive everywhere . The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read With every course in his particular .
O Westmoreland , thou art a summer bird , Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day .
Not only , sir , this your all licensed fool , But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth In rank and not to be endurèd riots . Sir , I had thought by making this well known unto you To have found a safe redress , but now grow fearful By what yourself too late have spoke and done That you protect this course and put it on By your allowance which if you should , the fault Would not ’scape censure , nor the redresses sleep Which in the tender of a wholesome weal Might in their working do you that offense ,
Here comes more news .
From enemies heaven keep your Majesty , And when they stand against you , may they fall As those that I am come to tell you of . The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph , With a great power of English and of Scots , Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown . The manner and true order of the fight This packet , please it you , contains at large .
And wherefore should these good news make me sick Will fortune never come with both hands full , But write her fair words still in foulest letters She either gives a stomach and no food
I must to England , you know that
Alack , I had forgot . Tis so concluded on .
There’s letters sealed , and my two schoolfellows , Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged , They bear the mandate . They must sweep my way And marshal me to knavery . Let it work , For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard . And ’t shall go hard , But I will delve one yard below their mines , And blow them at the moon . Oh , ’tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet . This man shall set me packing . I’ll lug the guts into the neighbor room . Mother , good night . Indeed this counselor Is now most still , most secret , and most grave Who was in life a foolish prating knave . Come , sir , to draw toward an end with you . Good night , mother .
Why , now thou hast unwished five thousand men , Which likes me better than to wish us one . You know your places . God be with you all . Tucket
Once more I come to know of thee , King Harry , If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound , Before thy most assurèd overthrow . For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted . Besides , in mercy , The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance , that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where , wretches , their poor bodies Must lie and fester .
Who hath sent thee now
The constable of France .
I pray thee , bear my former answer back . Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones . Good God , why should they mock poor fellows thus The man that once did sell the lion’s skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him . A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves , upon the which , I trust , Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work . And those that leave their valiant bones in France , Dying like men though buried in your dunghills , They shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven , Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,
Set on your foot , And with a heart new fired I follow you , To do I know not what . But it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on .
Follow me , then .
Come , leave your tears a brief farewell the beast Where is your ancient courage you were used To say extremity was the trier of spirits That common chances common men could bear That when the sea was calm all boats alike Show’d mastership in floating fortune’s blows , When most struck home , being gentle wounded , craves A noble cunning you were used to load me With precepts that would make invincible The heart that conn’d them .
Knock , knock Never at quiet . What are you But this place is too cold for hell . I’ll devil porter it no further . I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire .
O heavens O heavens
Nay prithee , woman ,
Anon , anon I pray you , remember the porter .
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome , And occupations perish
Was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , That you do lie so late
What , what , what I shall be loved when I am lack’d . Nay , mother . Resume that spirit , when you were wont to say , If you had been the wife of Hercules , Six of his labours you’ld have done , and saved Your husband so much sweat . Cominius , Droop not adieu . Farewell , my wife , my mother I’ll do well yet . Thou old and true Menenius , Thy tears are salter than a younger man’s , And venomous to thine eyes . My sometime general , I have seen thee stem , and thou hast oft beheld Heart hardening spectacles tell these sad women ’Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes , As ’tis to laugh at ’em . My mother , you wot well My hazards still have been your solace and Believe’t not lightly though I go alone , Like to a lonely dragon , that his fen Makes fear’d and talk’d of more than seen your son Will or exceed the common or be caught With cautelous baits and practise .
Faith sir , we were carousing till the second cock . And drink , sir , is a great provoker of three things .
What three things does drink especially provoke
Marry , sir , nose painting , sleep , and urine . Lechery , sir , it provokes and unprovokes . It provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance . Therefore , much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery . It makes him , and it mars him it sets him on , and it takes him off it persuades him , and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion , equivocates him in a sleep , and , giving him the lie , leaves him .
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
Tut , I came not to hear this .
Then to the point . In short time after , he deposed the King , Soon after that deprived him of his life And , in the neck of that , tasked the whole state . To make that worse , suffered his kinsman March to be engaged in Wales , There without ransom to lie forfeited , Disgraced me in my happy victories , Sought to entrap me by intelligence , Rated mine uncle from the council board , In rage dismissed my father from the court , Broke oath on oath , committed wrong on wrong , And in conclusion drove us to seek out This head of safety , and withal to pry Into his title , the which we find Too indirect for long continuance .
Which else were shame , that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding .
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight . Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out , Help , ho They murder Caesar Who’s within
For you know , nuncle , The hedge sparrow fed the cuckoo so long , That it’s had it head bit off by it young . So out went the candle and we were left darkling .
Are you our daughter
My lord .
Come , sir , I would you would make use of that good wisdom Whereof I know you are fraught , and put away These dispositions that of late transform you From what you rightly are .
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success .
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse Whoop , Jug I love thee .
I will , my lord .
Does any here know me Why , this is not Lear . Doth Lear walk thus Speak thus Where are his eyes Either his notion weakens , or his discernings Are lethargied . Ha , sleeping or waking Sure , ’tis not so . Who is it that can tell me who I am
What mean you , Caesar Think you to walk forth You shall not stir out of your house today .
Lear’s shadow .
Caesar shall forth . The things that threatened me Ne er looked but on my back . When they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanishèd .
I would learn that . For by the marks Of sovereignty , knowledge , and reason , I should be false persuaded I had daughters .
Which they will make an obedient father .
Caesar , I never stood on ceremonies , Yet now they fright me . There is one within , Besides the things that we have heard and seen , Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch . A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets , And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .
Your name , fair gentlewoman
That it did , sir , i th very throat on me but I requited him for his lie , and , I think , being too strong for him , though he took up my legs sometime , yet I made a shift to cast him .
Is thy master stirring
Our knocking has awaked him . Here he comes .
Good morrow , noble sir .
There’s matter in these sighs , these profound heaves . You must translate . Tis fit we understand them . Where is your son
Good morrow , both .
Bestow this place on us a little while .
Is the king stirring , worthy thane
Ah , my good lord , what have I seen tonight
Not yet .
What , Gertrude How does Hamlet
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier . In his lawless fit , Behind the arras hearing something stir , Whips out his rapier , cries , A rat , a rat And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man .
O heavy deed It had been so with us , had we been there . His liberty is full of threats to all To you yourself , to us , to everyone . Alas , how shall this bloody deed be answered It will be laid to us , whose providence Should have kept short , restrained and out of haunt , This mad young man . But so much was our love , We would not understand what was most fit ,
Such are the poor , in health or else a feast And takes away the stomach such are the rich , That have abundance and enjoy it not . I should rejoice now at this happy news , And now my sight fails , and my brain is giddy . O , me Come near me , now I am much ill .
Comfort , your Majesty .
He did command me to call timely on him . I have almost slipped the hour .
O , my royal father
I’ll bring you to him .
My sovereign lord , cheer up yourself , look up .
Shall I return this answer to the King
Not so , Sir Walter . We’ll withdraw awhile . Go to the King , and let there be impawned Some surety for a safe return again , And in the morning early shall my uncle Bring him our purposes . And so farewell .
Be patient , princes . You do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary . Stand from him , give him air . He’ll straight be well .
I would you would accept of grace and love .
No , no , he cannot long hold out these pangs . Th incessant care and labor of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break out .
I know this is a joyful trouble to you , But yet ’tis one .
The people fear me , for they do observe Unfathered heirs and loathly births of nature . The seasons change their manners , as the year Had found some months asleep and leapt them over .
The river hath thrice flowed , no ebb between , And the old folk , time’s doting chronicles , Say it did so a little time before That our great grandsire , Edward , sicked and died .
The labor we delight in physics pain . This is the door .
Speak lower , princes , for the King recovers .
And maybe so we shall .
I’ll make so bold to call , For ’tis my limited service .
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France . Mark , then , abounding valor in our English , That being dead , like to the bullet’s crazing , Break out into a second course of mischief , Killing in relapse of mortality . Let me speak proudly tell the constable We are but warriors for the working day Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched With rainy marching in the painful field . There’s not a piece of feather in our host Good argument , I hope , we will not fly And time hath worn us into slovenry . But , by the Mass , our hearts are in the trim , And my poor soldiers tell me , yet ere night They’ll be in fresher robes , or they will pluck The gay new coats o er the French soldiers heads And turn them out of service . If they do this , As , if God please , they shall , my ransom then Will soon be levied . Herald , save thou thy labor . Come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald . They shall have none , I swear , but these my joints , Which , if they have , as I will leave em them , Shall yield them little . Tell the constable .
Pray God you do .
I shall , King Harry . And so fare thee well . Thou never shalt hear herald anymore .
My first son . Whither wilt thou go Take good Cominius With thee awhile determine on some course , More than a wild exposture to each chance That starts i’ the way before thee .
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom .
O the gods
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war , Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol . The noise of battle hurtled in the air . Horses did neigh , and dying men did groan , And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets . O Caesar These things are beyond all use , And I do fear them .
I’ll follow thee a month , devise with thee Where thou shalt rest , that thou mayst hear of us And we of thee so if the time thrust forth A cause for thy repeal , we shall not send O’er the vast world to seek a single man , And lose advantage , which doth ever cool I’ the absence of the needer .
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods Yet Caesar shall go forth , for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar .
Fare ye well Thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full Of the wars’ surfeits , to go rove with one That’s yet unbruised bring me but out at gate . Come , my sweet wife , my dearest mother , and My friends of noble touch , when I am forth , Bid me farewell , and smile . I pray you , come . While I remain above the ground , you shall Hear from me still , and never of me aught But what is like me formerly .
When beggars die there are no comets seen . The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
Goes the king hence today
Cowards die many times before their deaths . The valiant never taste of death but once . Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me most strange that men should fear , Seeing that death , a necessary end , Will come when it will come .
What say the augurers
They would not have you to stir forth today . Plucking the entrails of an offering forth , They could not find a heart within the beast .
The gods do this in shame of cowardice . Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear . No , Caesar shall not . Danger knows full well
He does . He did appoint so .
The night has been unruly . Where we lay , Our chimneys were blown down and , as they say , Lamentings heard i th air , strange screams of death , And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time . The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night . Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake .
This admiration , sir , is much o th savor Of other your new pranks . I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright . As you are old and reverend , should be wise . Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires , Men so disordered , so debauched and bold That this our court , infected with their manners , Shows like a riotous inn . Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace . The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy . Be then desired By her that else will take the thing she begs , A little to disquantity your train , And the remainder that shall still depend To be such men as may besort your age , Which know themselves and you .
Twas a rough night .
Darkness and devils Saddle my horses . Call my train together . Degenerate bastard , I’ll not trouble thee . Yet have I left a daughter .
You strike my people , and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters .
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it .
O horror , horror , horror Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee
What’s the matter
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece . Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord’s anointed temple , and stole thence The life o th building
What is ’t you say The life
Mean you his majesty
Woe that too late repents O sir , are you come Is it your will Speak , sir . Prepare my horses .
That Caesar is more dangerous than he . We are two lions littered in one day , And I the elder and more terrible . And Caesar shall go forth .
This apoplexy will certain be his end .
Alas , my lord , Your wisdom is consumed in confidence . Do not go forth today . Call it my fear That keeps you in the house , and not your own . We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house , And he shall say you are not well today . Let me , upon my knee , prevail in this .
I pray you , take me up and bear me hence Into some other chamber . Softly , pray .
Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And for thy humor I will stay at home .
Let there be no noise made , my gentle friends , Unless some dull and favorable hand Will whisper music to my weary spirit .
Here’s Decius Brutus . He shall tell them so .
Call for the music in the other room .
Caesar , all hail Good morrow , worthy Caesar . I come to fetch you to the senate house .
Set me the crown upon my pillow here .
His eye is hollow , and he changes much .
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today . Cannot is false , and that I dare not , falser . I will not come today . Tell them so , Decius .
Say he is sick .
Less noise , less noise .
Shall Caesar send a lie Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
Who saw the Duke of Clarence
I am here , brother , full of heaviness .
That’s worthily As any ear can hear . Come , let’s not weep . If I could shake off but one seven years From these old arms and legs , by the good gods , I’ld with thee every foot .
How now Rain within doors , and none abroad How doth the King
Give me thy hand Come .
Exceeding ill .
Heard he the good news yet Tell it him .
He altered much upon the hearing it .
My lord , most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward .
Take it , brave York . Now , soldiers , march away , And how Thou pleasest , God , dispose the day .
Hie , good Sir Michael , bear this sealèd brief With winged haste to the Lord Marshal , This to my cousin Scroop , and all the rest To whom they are directed . If you knew How much they do import , you would make haste .
My good lord , I guess their tenor .
But , like the owner of a foul disease , To keep it from divulging , let it feed Even on the pith of life . Where is he gone
Like enough you do . Tomorrow , good Sir Michael , is a day Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men Must bide the touch . For , sir , at Shrewsbury , As I am truly given to understand , The King with mighty and quick raisèd power Meets with Lord Harry . And I fear , Sir Michael , What with the sickness of Northumberland , Whose power was in the first proportion , And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence , Who with them was a rated sinew too And comes not in , o er ruled by prophecies , I fear the power of Percy is too weak To wage an instant trial with the King .
To draw apart the body he hath killed , O er whom his very madness , like some ore Among a mineral of metals base , Shows itself pure . He weeps for what is done .
Why , my good lord , you need not fear . There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer .
O Gertrude , come away The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch But we will ship him hence , and this vile deed We must , with all our majesty and skill , Both countenance and excuse . Ho , Guildenstern
No , Mortimer is not there .
But there is Mordake , Vernon , Lord Harry Percy , And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head Of gallant warriors , noble gentlemen .
Friends both , go join you with some further aid . Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain , And from his mother’s closet hath he dragged him . Go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body Into the chapel . I pray you , haste in this .
Come , Gertrude , we’ll call up our wisest friends , And let them know both what we mean to do And what’s untimely done . So dreaded slander Whose whisper o er the world’s diameter , As level as the cannon to his blank , Transports the poisoned shot may miss our name And hit the woundless air . Oh , come away My soul is full of discord and dismay .
Approach the chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon . Do not bid me speak . See , and then speak yourselves .
Awake , awake Ring the alarum bell . Murder and treason Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm Awake Shake off this downy sleep , death’s counterfeit , And look on death itself Up , up , and see The great doom’s image Malcolm Banquo As from your graves rise up , and walk like sprites , To countenance this horror Ring the bell
Decius , go tell them Caesar will not come .
Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so .
The cause is in my will . I will not come . That is enough to satisfy the senate . But for your private satisfaction , Because I love you , I will let you know . Calphurnia here , my wife , stays me at home . She dreamt tonight she saw my statue , Which , like a fountain with an hundred spouts , Did run pure blood . And many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it . And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent , and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today .
This dream is all amiss interpreted . It was a vision fair and fortunate . Your statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bathed , Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood , and that great men shall press For tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance . This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified .
And this way have you well expounded it .
I have , when you have heard what I can say . And know it now the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar .
If he be sick with joy , he’ll recover without physic .
Yield , cur .
Not so much noise , my lords . Sweet Prince , speak low . The King your father is disposed to sleep .
Je pense que vous êtes gentilhomme de bonne qualité .
Let us withdraw into the other room .
Bid them all home he’s gone , and we’ll no further . The nobility are vex’d , whom we see have sided In his behalf .
Qualtitie calmie custure me . Art thou a gentleman What is thy name Discuss .
Will ’t please your Grace to go along with us
Ô Seigneur Dieu
Now we have shown our power , Let us seem humbler after it is done Than when it was a doing .
No , I will sit and watch here by the King .
O Seigneur Dew should be a gentleman . Perpend my words , O Seigneur Dew , and mark O Seigneur Dew , thou diest on point of fox , except , O Seigneur , thou do give to me egregious ransom .
Bid them home Say their great enemy is gone , and they Stand in their ancient strength .
Ô , prenez miséricorde Ayez pitié de moi
Dismiss them home .
Moy shall not serve . I will have forty moys , or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat in drops of crimson blood .
Here comes his mother .
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow , Being so troublesome a bedfellow O polished perturbation , golden care , That keep’st the ports of slumber open wide To many a watchful night sleep with it now Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet As he whose brow with homely biggen bound Snores out the watch of night . O majesty , When thou dost pinch thy bearer , thou dost sit Like a rich armor worn in heat of day , That scald’st with safety . By his gates of breath There lies a downy feather which stirs not Did he suspire , that light and weightless down Perforce must move . My gracious lord , my father , This sleep is sound indeed . This is a sleep That from this golden rigol hath divorced So many English kings . Thy due from me Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood , Which nature , love , and filial tenderness Shall , O dear father , pay thee plenteously . My due from thee is this imperial crown , Which , as immediate as thy place and blood ,
Est il impossible d Échapper la force de ton bras
Let’s not meet her .
Why
They say she’s mad .
They have ta’en note of us keep on your way .
What’s the business , That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house Speak , speak
O gentle lady , Tis not for you to hear what I can speak The repetition , in a woman’s ear , Would murder as it fell .
O Banquo , Banquo , Our royal master’s murdered
Woe , alas What , in our house
If you shall send them word you will not come , Their minds may change . Besides , it were a mock Apt to be rendered for someone to say , Break up the senate till another time When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams . If Caesar hide himself , shall they not whisper , Lo , Caesar is afraid Pardon me , Caesar . For my dear , dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this , And reason to my love is liable .
Ingratitude , thou marble hearted fiend , More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster .
Pray , sir , be patient .
O , ye’re well met the hoarded plague o’ the gods Requite your love
Peace , peace be not so loud .
If that I could for weeping , you should hear , Nay , and you shall hear some .
How foolish do your fears seem now , Calphurnia I am ashamèd I did yield to them . Give me my robe , for I will go .
And look , where Publius is come to fetch me .
Good morrow , Caesar .
Welcome , Publius . What , Brutus , are you stirred so early too Good morrow , Casca . Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean . What is ’t o clock
Caesar , ’tis strucken eight .
I thank you for your pains and courtesy .
And so there is . But yet the King hath drawn The special head of all the land together The Prince of Wales , Lord John of Lancaster , The noble Westmoreland , and warlike Blunt , And many more corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms .
Doubt not , my lord , they shall be well opposed .
I hope no less , yet needful ’tis to fear And to prevent the worst , Sir Michael , speed . For if Lord Percy thrive not , ere the King Dismiss his power , he means to visit us , For he hath heard of our confederacy , And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him Therefore make haste . I must go write again To other friends . And so farewell , Sir Michael .
Too cruel any where . Dear Duff , I prithee , contradict thyself , And say it is not so .
Had I but died an hour before this chance , I had lived a blessèd time , for from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality . All is but toys . Renown and grace is dead . The wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of .
What is amiss
You are , and do not know ’t . The spring , the head , the fountain of your blood Is stopped the very source of it is stopped .
Your royal father’s murdered .
Oh , by whom
Those of his chamber , as it seemed , had done ’t . Their hands and faces were all badged with blood . So were their daggers , which unwiped we found Upon their pillows . They stared , and were distracted . No man’s life was to be trusted with them .
Oh , yet I do repent me of my fury , That I did kill them .
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in And thy dear judgment out Go , go , my people .
My lord , I am guiltless , as I am ignorant , Of what hath moved you .
It may be so , my lord . Hear , Nature , hear , dear goddess , hear Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful . Into her womb convey sterility . Dry up in her the organs of increase , And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her . If she must teem , Create her child of spleen , that it may live And be a thwart disnatured torment to her . Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth , With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks ,
Brass , cur Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat , offer’st me brass
Ô , pardonnez moi
Say’st thou me so Is that a ton of moys Come hither , boy . Ask me this slave in French what is his name .
Écoutez . Comment êtes vous appelé
Monsieur le Fer .
He says his name is Master Fer .
Master Fer . I’ll fer him , and firk him , and ferret him . Discuss the same in French unto him .
I do not know the French for fer , and ferret , and firk .
Bid him prepare , for I will cut his throat .
Derives itself to me . Lo , where it sits , Which God shall guard . And put the world’s whole strength Into one giant arm , it shall not force This lineal honor from me . This from thee Will I to mine leave , as ’tis left to me .
Que dit il , monsieur
Warwick Gloucester Clarence
Il me commande à vous dire que vous faites vous prêt , car ce soldat ici est disposé tout à cette heure de couper votre gorge .
Owy , cuppele gorge , permafoy , peasant , unless thou give me crowns , brave crowns , or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword .
Doth the King call
What would your Majesty How fares your Grace
Why did you leave me here alone , my lords
We left the Prince my brother here , my liege , Who undertook to sit and watch by you .
Safely stowed .
Hamlet Lord Hamlet
The Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him . He is not here .
This door is open . He is gone this way .
But soft , what noise Who calls on Hamlet Oh , here they come .
He came not through the chamber where we stayed .
What have you done , my lord , with the dead body
Where is the crown Who took it from my pillow
Compounded it with dust , whereto ’tis kin .
When we withdrew , my liege , we left it here .
Tell us where ’tis , that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel .
The Prince hath ta en it hence . Go seek him out . Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death Find him , my Lord of Warwick . Chide him hither .
Do not believe it .
Believe what
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own . Besides , to be demanded of a sponge What replication should be made by the son of a king
Take you me for a sponge , my lord
Wherefore did you so
Who can be wise , amazed , temp rate , and furious , Loyal and neutral , in a moment No man . Th expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser , reason . Here lay Duncan , His silver skin laced with his golden blood , And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance there , the murderers , Steeped in the colors of their trade , their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore . Who could refrain , That had a heart to love , and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known
Help me hence , ho
Look to the lady .
Why do we hold our tongues , That most may claim this argument for ours
What should be spoken here , where our fate , Hid in an auger hole , may rush and seize us Let’s away . Our tears are not yet brewed .
Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion .
Look to the lady .
How bloodily the sun begins to peer Above yon busky hill . The day looks pale At his distemp rature .
The southern wind Doth play the trumpet to his purposes , And by his hollow whistling in the leaves Foretells a tempest and a blust ring day .
Then with the losers let it sympathize , For nothing can seem foul to those that win .
How now , my Lord of Worcester Tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet . You have deceived our trust And made us doff our easy robes of peace To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel . This is not well , my lord this is not well . What say you to it Will you again unknit This curlish knot of all abhorrèd war And move in that obedient orb again Where you did give a fair and natural light , And be no more an exhaled meteor , A prodigy of fear and a portent Of broachèd mischief to the unborn times
And when we have our naked frailties hid , That suffer in exposure , let us meet And question this most bloody piece of work , To know it further . Fears and scruples shake us . In the great hand of God I stand , and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice .
And so do I .
So all .
Let’s briefly put on manly readiness , And meet i th hall together .
Well contented .
What will you do Let’s not consort with them . To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy . I’ll to England .
To Ireland , I . Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer . Where we are , There’s daggers in men’s smiles . The near in blood , The nearer bloody .
This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted , and our safest way Is to avoid the aim . Therefore , to horse , And let us not be dainty of leave taking , But shift away . There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left .
This part of his conjoins with my disease And helps to end me . See , sons , what things you are , How quickly nature falls into revolt When gold becomes her object For this the foolish overcareful fathers Have broke their sleep with thoughts , Their brains with care , their bones with industry . For this they have engrossèd and piled up The canker’d heaps of strange achievèd gold . For this they have been thoughtful to invest Their sons with arts and martial exercises When , like the bee , tolling from every flower The virtuous sweets , Our thighs packed with wax , our mouths with honey , We bring it to the hive and , like the bees , Are murdered for our pains . This bitter taste Yield his engrossments to the ending father .
Now , where is he that will not stay so long Till his friend sickness hath determined me
My lord , I found the Prince in the next room , Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks , With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow That tyranny , which never quaffed but blood , Would , by beholding him , have washed his knife With gentle eyedrops . He is coming hither .
But wherefore did he take away the crown
Ô , je vous supplie , pour l amour de Dieu , me pardoner . Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison . Gardez ma vie , et je vous donnerai deux cents écus
What are his words
He prays you to save his life . He is a gentleman of a good house , and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns .
Tell him my fury shall abate , and I the crowns will take .
Petit monsieur , que dit il
Encore qu il est contre son jurement de pardoner aucun prisonnier néanmoins , pour les écus que vous lui avez promis , il est content à vous donner la liberté , le franchisement .
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercîments , et je m estime heureux que j ai tombé entre les mains d un chevalier , je pense , le plus brave , vaillant , et très distingué seigneur d Angleterre .
Expound unto me , boy .
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks , and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall n into the hands of one , as he thinks , the most brave , valorous , and thrice worthy seigneur of England .
As I suck blood , I will some mercy show . Follow me .
Ay , sir , that soaks up the king’s countenance , his rewards , his authorities . But such officers do the king best service in the end . He keeps them , like an ape , in the corner of his jaw , first mouthed to be last swallowed . When he needs what you have gleaned , it is but squeezing you and , sponge , you shall be dry again .
I understand you not , my lord .
I am glad of it . A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear .
My lord , you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king .
The body is with the king , but the king is not with the body . The king is a thing
A thing , my lord
Of nothing . Bring me to him . Hide , fox , and all after .
Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange , but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings .
Ha , good father , Thou seest the heavens , as troubled with man’s act , Threatens his bloody stage . By th clock ’tis day , And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp . Is ’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame That darkness does the face of Earth entomb When living light should kiss it
Tis unnatural , Even like the deed that’s done . On Tuesday last , A falcon , tow ring in her pride of place , Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed .
And Duncan’s horses a thing most strange and certain Beauteous and swift , the minions of their race , Turned wild in nature , broke their stalls , flung out , Contending gainst obedience , as they would Make war with mankind .
Tis said they eat each other .
They did so , to th amazement of mine eyes That looked upon ’t . Here comes the good Macduff .
Hear me , my liege For mine own part I could be well content To entertain the lag end of my life With quiet hours . For I do protest I have not sought the day of this dislike .
You have not sought it . How comes it then
Rebellion lay in his way , and he found it .
Peace , chewet , peace .
It pleased your Majesty to turn your looks Of favour from myself and all our house And yet I must remember you , my lord , We were the first and dearest of your friends . For you my staff of office did I break In Richard’s time , and posted day and night To meet you on the way , and kiss your hand When yet you were in place and in account Nothing so strong and fortunate as I . It was myself , my brother , and his son That brought you home and boldly did outdare The dangers of the time . You swore to us , And you did swear that oath at Doncaster , That you did nothing purpose gainst the state , Nor claim no further than your new fall n right , The seat of Gaunt , dukedom of Lancaster . To this we swore our aid . But in short space It rained down fortune show ring on your head , And such a flood of greatness fell on you What with our help , what with the absent King , What with the injuries of a wanton time , The seeming sufferances that you had borne ,
How goes the world , sir , now
Why , see you not
Is ’t known who did this more than bloody deed
Those that Macbeth hath slain .
Alas , the day What good could they pretend
They were suborned . Malcolm and Donalbain , the king’s two sons , Are stol n away and fled , which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed .
Gainst nature still Thriftless ambition , that will raven up Thine own lives means Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth .
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested .
Where is Duncan’s body
Carried to Colmekill , The sacred storehouse of his predecessors , And guardian of their bones .
Will you to Scone
No , cousin , I’ll to Fife .
Well , I will thither .
Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits To laughter and contempt , that she may feel That she may feel How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is To have a thankless child . Away , away
See , Antony , that revels long a nights , Is notwithstanding up . Good morrow , Antony .
Now gods that we adore , whereof comes this
So to most noble Caesar .
Never afflict yourself to know more of it , But let his disposition have that scope That dotage gives it .
Bid them prepare within . I am to blame to be thus waited for . Now , Cinna . Now , Metellus . What , Trebonius , I have an hour’s talk in store for you . Remember that you call on me today . Be near me , that I may remember you .
What , fifty of my followers at a clap Within a fortnight
Caesar , I will . And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further .
What’s the matter , sir
Good friends , go in and taste some wine with me . And we , like friends , will straightway go together .
That every like is not the same , O Caesar , The heart of Brutus earns to think upon .
I’ll tell thee . Life and death I am ashamed That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus , That these hot tears which break from me perforce Should make thee worth them . Blasts and fogs upon thee Th untented woundings of a father’s curse Pierce every sense about thee Old fond eyes , Beweep this cause again , I’ll pluck ye out
Lo where he comes . Come hither to me , Harry . Depart the chamber . Leave us here alone .
I never thought to hear you speak again .
Thy wish was father , Harry , to that thought . I stay too long by thee I weary thee . Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth , Thou seek’st the greatness that will overwhelm thee . Stay but a little , for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind That it will quickly drop . My day is dim . Thou hast stol n that which after some few hours Were thine without offense , and at my death Thou hast sealed up my expectation . Thy life did manifest thou loved’st me not , And thou wilt have me die assured of it . Thou hid’st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts , Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart To stab at half an hour of my life . What , canst thou not forbear me half an hour Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself , And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear That thou art crownèd , not that I am dead . Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head Only compound me with forgotten dust . Give that which gave thee life unto the worms . Pluck down my officers , break my decrees ,
I have sent to seek him and to find the body . How dangerous is it that this man goes loose Yet must not we put the strong law on him . He’s loved of the distracted multitude , Who like not in their judgment , but their eyes . And where ’tis so , th offender’s scourge is weighed , But never the offense . To bear all smooth and even , This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause . Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved , Or not at all .
How now , what hath befall n
Where the dead body is bestowed , my lord , We cannot get from him .
But where is he
Without , my lord guarded , to know your pleasure .
Bring him before us .
Ho , Guildenstern Bring in my lord .
Now , Hamlet , where’s Polonius
Suivez vous le grand capitaine .
I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart . But the saying is true The empty vessel makes the greatest sound . Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valor than this roaring devil i th old play , that everyone may pare his nails with a wooden dagger , and they are both hanged , and so would this be if he durst steal any thing adventurously . I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp . The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .
Well , may you see things well done there . Adieu , Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
Farewell , father .
God’s benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes .
And the contrarious winds that held the King So long in his unlucky Irish wars That all in England did repute him dead And from this swarm of fair advantages You took occasion to be quickly wooed To gripe the general sway into your hand , Forget your oath to us at Doncaster And being fed by us , you used us so As that ungentle gull , the cuckoo’s bird , Useth the sparrow did oppress our nest , Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk That even our love durst not come near your sight For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing We were enforced for safety sake to fly Out of sight and raise this present head , Whereby we stand opposèd by such means As you yourself have forged against yourself By unkind usage , dangerous countenance , And violation of all faith and troth Sworn to us in your younger enterprise .
These things indeed you have articulate , Proclaimed at market crosses , read in churches , To face the garment of rebellion With some fine color that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents , Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation . And never yet did insurrection want Such water colors to impaint his cause , Nor moody beggars starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusion .
In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial . Tell your nephew ,
Will you be gone
You shall stay too I would I had the power To say so to my husband .
Are you mankind
Ay , fool is that a shame Note but this fool . Was not a man my father Hadst thou foxship To banish him that struck more blows for Rome Than thou hast spoken words
O blessed heavens
More noble blows than ever thou wise words And for Rome’s good . I’ll tell thee what yet go Nay , but thou shalt stay too I would my son Were in Arabia , and thy tribe before him , His good sword in his hand .
What then
What then He’ld make an end of thy posterity .
Bastards and all . Good man , the wounds that he does bear for Rome
Come , come , peace .
I would he had continued to his country As he began , and not unknit himself The noble knot he made .
Thou hast it now king , Cawdor , Glamis , all , As the weird women promised , and I fear Thou played’st most foully for ’t . Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity , But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings . If there come truth from them As upon thee , Macbeth , their speeches shine Why , by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my oracles as well , And set me up in hope But hush , no more .
Here’s our chief guest .
If he had been forgotten , It had been as a gap in our great feast , And all thing unbecoming .
Tonight we hold a solemn supper , sir , And I’ll request your presence .
Let your highness Command upon me , to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit .
For now a time is come to mock at form . Harry the Fifth is crowned . Up , vanity , Down , royal state , all you sage counsillors , hence , And to the English court assemble now , From every region , apes of idleness . Now , neighbor confines , purge you of your scum . Have you a ruffian that will swear , drink , dance , Revel the night , rob , murder , and commit The oldest sins the newest kind of ways Be happy , he will trouble you no more . England shall double gild his treble guilt . England shall give him office , honor , might , For the fifth Harry from curbed license plucks The muzzle of restraint , and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent . O my poor kingdom , sick with civil blows When that my care could not withhold thy riots , What wilt thou do when riot is thy care O , thou wilt be a wilderness again , Peopled with wolves , thy old inhabitants .
O pardon me , my liege But for my tears , The moist impediments unto my speech , I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard The course of it so far . There is your crown , And He that wears the crown immortally Long guard it yours . If I affect it more Than as your honor and as your renown , Let me no more from this obedience rise , Which my most inward true and duteous spirit Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending . God witness with me , when I here came in And found no course of breath within your Majesty , How cold it struck my heart If I do feign , O , let me in my present wildness die
At supper .
At supper where
Not where he eats , but where he is eaten . A certain convocation of politic worms are e en at him . Your worm is your only emperor for diet . We fat all creatures else to fat us , and we fat ourselves for maggots . Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes , but to one table . That’s the end .
Alas , alas
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king , and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm .
What dost you mean by this
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar .
Where is Polonius
In heaven . Send hither to see . If your messenger find him not there , seek him i th other place yourself . But if indeed you find him not within this month , you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby .
Go seek him there .
He will stay till ye come .
Ride you this afternoon
Ay , my good lord .
We should have else desired your good advice Which still hath been both grave and prosperous In this day’s council , but we’ll take tomorrow . Is ’t far you ride
As far , my lord , as will fill up the time Twixt this and supper . Go not my horse the better , I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain .
Fail not our feast .
My lord , I will not .
We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed In England and in Ireland , not confessing Their cruel parricide , filling their hearers With strange invention . But of that tomorrow , When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly . Hie you to horse . Adieu , Till your return at night . Goes Fleance with you
Ay , my good lord . Our time does call upon ’s .
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot , And so I do commend you to their backs . Farewell .
Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night . To make society The sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone . While then , God be with you
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy . By my hopes , This present enterprise set off his head , I do not think a braver gentleman , More active valiant , or more valiant young , More daring or more bold , is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds . For my part , I may speak it to my shame , I have a truant been to chivalry , And so I hear he doth account me too . Yet this before my father’s majesty I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation , And will , to save the blood on either side , Try fortune with him in a single fight .
And , Prince of Wales , so dare we venture thee , Albeit considerations infinite Do make against it . No , good Worcester , no , We love our people well , even those we love That are misled upon your cousin’s part . And , will they take the offer of our grace , Both he and they and you , yea , every man Shall be my friend again , and I’ll be his . So tell your cousin , and bring me word What he will do . But if he will not yield , Rebuke and dread correction wait on us , And they shall do their office . So begone . We will not now be troubled with reply . We offer fair . Take it advisedly .
It will not be accepted , on my life . The Douglas and the Hotspur both together Are confident against the world in arms .
And cast you , with the waters that you loose , To temper clay . Yea , is ’t come to this Ha Let it be so . I have another daughter , Who I am sure is kind and comfortable . When she shall hear this of thee , with her nails She’ll flay thy wolvish visage . Thou shalt find That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever . Thou shalt , I warrant thee .
Do you mark that , my lord
I cannot be so partial , Goneril , To the great love I bear you
Pray you , content . Come , sire , no more . What , Oswald , ho You , sir , more knave than fool , after your master .
Nuncle Lear , nuncle Lear , tarry and take the fool with thee . A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter , If my cap would buy a halter . So the fool follows after .
This man hath had good counsel a hundred knights Tis politic and safe to let him keep At point a hundred knights , yes , that on every dream , Each buzz , each fancy , each complaint , dislike , He may enguard his dotage with their powers And hold our lives in mercy Oswald , I say
Caesar , beware of Brutus . Take heed of Cassius . Come not near Casca . Have an eye to Cinna . Trust not Trebonius . Mark well Metellus Cimber . Decius Brutus loves thee not . Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius . There is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar . If thou beest not immortal , look about you . Security gives way to conspiracy . The mighty gods defend thee Thy lover , Artemidorus Here will I stand till Caesar pass along , And as a suitor will I give him this . My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation . If thou read this , O Caesar , thou mayst live . If not , the Fates with traitors do contrive .
Sirrah , a word with you . Attend those men Our pleasure
They are , my lord , without the palace gate .
Bring them before us .
To be thus is nothing , But to be safely thus . Our fears in Banquo Stick deep , and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared . Tis much he dares , And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety . There is none but he Whose being I do fear , and under him My genius is rebuked , as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar . He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me And bade them speak to him . Then , prophetlike , They hailed him father to a line of kings . Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown And put a barren scepter in my grip , Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand , No son of mine succeeding . If ’t be so , For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man , To make them kings , the seed of Banquo kings Rather than so , come fate into the list , And champion me to th utterance . Who’s there
And never live to show th incredulous world The noble change that I have purposèd . Coming to look on you , thinking you dead , And dead almost , my liege , to think you were , I spake unto this crown as having sense , And thus upbraided it The care on thee depending Hath fed upon the body of my father Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold . Other , less fine in carat , is more precious , Preserving life in med cine potable But thou , most fine , most honored , most renowned , Hast eat thy bearer up . Thus , my most royal liege , Accusing it , I put it on my head To try with it , as with an enemy That had before my face murdered my father , The quarrel of a true inheritor . But if it did infect my blood with joy Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride , If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did with the least affection of a welcome Give entertainment to the might of it , Let God forever keep it from my head And make me as the poorest vassal is That doth with awe and terror kneel to it .
O my son , God put it in thy mind to take it hence That thou mightst win the more thy father’s love , Pleading so wisely in excuse of it . Come hither , Harry , sit thou by my bed And hear , I think , the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe . God knows , my son , By what bypaths and indirect crook’d ways I met this crown , and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head . To thee it shall descend with better quiet ,
Ô diable
Ô seigneur Le jour est perdu , tout est erdu
Mort de ma vie , all is confounded , all Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes .
Ô méchante Fortune Do not run away .
Why , all our ranks are broke .
Hamlet , this deed , for thine especial safety Which we do tender as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done must send thee hence With fiery quickness . Therefore prepare thyself . The bark is ready and the wind at help , Th associates tend , and everything is bent For England .
For England
Ay , Hamlet .
O perdurable shame Let’s stab ourselves . Be these the wretches that we played at dice for
Good .
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom
So is it , if thou knew’st our purposes .
I see a cherub that sees them . But come , for England . Farewell , dear mother .
Shame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame Let us die . In once more Back again And he that will not follow Bourbon now , Let him go hence , and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door , Whilst by a slave , no gentler than my dog , His fairest daughter is contaminate .
Thy loving father , Hamlet .
Disorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now . Let us on heaps go offer up our lives .
My mother . Father and mother is man and wife , man and wife is one flesh , and so , my mother . Come , for England
Follow him at foot . Tempt him with speed aboard . Delay it not . I’ll have him hence tonight . Away For everything is sealed and done That else leans on the affair . Pray you , make haste .
And , England , if my love thou hold’st at aught As my great power thereof may give thee sense , Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword and thy free awe
Hence , therefore , every leader to his charge , For on their answer will we set on them , And God befriend us as our cause is just .
Hal , if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me , so ’tis a point of friendship .
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship . Say thy prayers , and farewell .
I would ’twere bedtime , Hal , and all well .
Why , thou owest God a death .
Tis not due yet . I would be loath to pay Him before His day . What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me Well , ’tis no matter . Honour pricks me on . Yea , but how if honor prick me off when I come on How then Can honor set to a leg no . Or an arm no . Or take away the grief of a wound No . Honor hath no skill in surgery , then No . What is honor A word . What is in that word honor What is that honor Air . A trim reckoning . Who hath it He that died o Wednesday . Doth he feel it No . Doth he hear it No . Tis insensible , then Yea , to the dead . But will it not live with the living No . Why Detraction will not suffer it . Therefore , I’ll none of it . Honor is a mere scutcheon . And so ends my catechism .
Now go to the door and stay there till we call .
Was it not yesterday we spoke together
It was , so please your highness .
Well then , now Have you considered of my speeches Know That it was he , in the times past , which held you So under fortune , which you thought had been Our innocent self . This I made good to you In our last conference , passed in probation with you , How you were borne in hand , how crossed , the instruments , Who wrought with them , and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say , Thus did Banquo .
You made it known to us .
I did so , and went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue , Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever
We are men , my liege .
Ay , in the catalogue ye go for men , As hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , curs , Shoughs , water rugs , and demi wolves are clept All by the name of dogs . The valued file Distinguishes the swift , the slow , the subtle , The housekeeper , the hunter , every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed , whereby he does receive Particular addition , from the bill That writes them all alike . And so of men . Now , if you have a station in the file , Not i th worst rank of manhood , say ’t , And I will put that business in your bosoms , Whose execution takes your enemy off , Grapples you to the heart and love of us , Who wear our health but sickly in his life , Which in his death were perfect .
I prithee , boy , run to the senate house . Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone . Why dost thou stay
To know my errand , madam .
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there . O constancy , be strong upon my side , Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue I have a man’s mind but a woman’s might . How hard it is for women to keep counsel Art thou here yet
Madam , what should I do Run to the Capitol , and nothing else And so return to you , and nothing else
Yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , For he went sickly forth . And take good note What Caesar doth , what suitors press to him . Hark , boy What noise is that
I hear none , madam .
Prithee , listen well . I heard a bustling rumor like a fray , And the wind brings it from the Capitol .
Sooth , madam , I hear nothing .
I am one , my liege , Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world .
And I another So weary with disasters , tugged with fortune , That I would set my life on any chance , To mend it or be rid on ’t .
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy .
True , my lord .
I would he had .
So is he mine and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life . And though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it , yet I must not , For certain friends that are both his and mine , Whose loves I may not drop , but wail his fall Who I myself struck down . And thence it is , That I to your assistance do make love , Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons .
‘I would he had’ ’Twas you incensed the rabble Cats , that can judge as fitly of his worth As I can of those mysteries which heaven Will not have earth to know .
Pray , let us go .
Now , pray , sir , get you gone You have done a brave deed . Ere you go , hear this As far as doth the Capitol exceed The meanest house in Rome , so far my son This lady’s husband here , this , do you see Whom you have banish’d , does exceed you all .
Well , well , we’ll leave you .
Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits
Take my prayers with you .
I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses Could I meet ’em But once a day , it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to’t .
You have told them home And , by my troth , you have cause . You’ll sup with me
Pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process , which imports at full , By letters congruing to that effect , The present death of Hamlet . Do it , England , For like the hectic in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me . Till I know ’tis done , Howe er my haps , my joys were ne er begun .
Better opinion , better confirmation , For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth . It seemed in me But as an honor snatched with boist rous hand , And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances , Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed , Wounding supposèd peace . All these bold fears Thou see’st with peril I have answerèd , For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that argument . And now my death Changes the mood , for what in me was purchased Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort . So thou the garland wear’st successively . Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do , Thou art not firm enough , since griefs are green , And all my friends , which thou must make thy friends , Have but their stings and teeth newly ta en out , By whose fell working I was first advanced And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displaced which to avoid , I cut them off and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land , Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near unto my state . Therefore , my Harry , Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels that action , hence borne out , May waste the memory of the former days . More would I , but my lungs are wasted so That strength of speech is utterly denied me . How I came by the crown , O God forgive , And grant it may with thee in true peace live .
My gracious liege , You won it , wore it , kept it , gave it me .
O no , my nephew must not know , Sir Richard , The liberal and kind offer of the King .
Twere best he did .
Then are we all undone . It is not possible , it cannot be The King should keep his word in loving us . He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offense in other faults . Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes , For treason is but trusted like the fox , Who , never so tame , so cherished and locked up , Will have a wild trick of his ancestors . Look how we can , or sad or merrily , Interpretation will misquote our looks , And we shall feed like oxen at a stall , The better cherished still the nearer death . My nephew’s trespass may be well forgot It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood , And an adopted name of privilege A hairbrained Hotspur governed by a spleen All his offenses live upon my head And on his father’s . We did train him on , And , his corruption being ta en from us , We as the spring of all shall pay for all . Therefore , good cousin , let not Harry know In any case the offer of the King .
Deliver what you will I’ll say ’tis so .
Well , you may fear too far .
Safer than trust too far . Let me still take away the harms I fear , Not fear still to be taken . I know his heart . What he hath uttered I have writ my sister . If she sustain him and his hundred knights When I have showed th unfitness
Here , madam .
How now , Oswald What , have you writ that letter to my sister
We shall , my lord , Perform what you command us .
Though our lives
Your spirits shine through you . Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves , Acquaint you with the perfect spy o th time , The moment on ’t for ’t must be done tonight , And something from the palace always thought That I require a clearness . And with him To leave no rubs nor botches in the work Fleance , his son , that keeps him company , Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father’s , must embrace the fate Of that dark hour . Resolve yourselves apart . I’ll come to you anon .
We are resolved , my lord .
I’ll call upon you straight . Abide within .
It is concluded . Banquo , thy soul’s flight , If it find heaven , must find it out tonight .
Is Banquo gone from court
Ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words .
Madam , I will .
Naught’s had , all’s spent , Where our desire is got without content . Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
How now , my lord Why do you keep alone , Of sorriest fancies your companions making , Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on Things without all remedy Should be without regard . What’s done is done .
We have scorched the snake , not killed it . She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth . But let the frame of things disjoint , both the worlds suffer , Ere we will eat our meal in fear , and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly . Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gain our peace , have sent to peace , Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy . Duncan is in his grave . After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well . Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison , Malice domestic , foreign levy , nothing Can touch him further .
Ay , madam .
Take you some company , and away to horse . Inform her full of my particular fear , And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more . Get you gone And hasten your return .
No , no , my lord , Though I condemn not , yet under pardon You are much more attasked for want of wisdom Than praised for harmful mildness .
How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell . Striving to better , oft we mar what’s well .
Go , Captain , from me greet the Danish king Tell him that , by his license , Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom . You know the rendezvous . If that his majesty would aught with us , We shall express our duty in his eye , And let him know so .
I will do ’t , my lord .
Go softly on .
Good sir , whose powers are these
They are of Norway , sir .
Come hither , fellow . Which way hast thou been
How purposed , sir , I pray you
At mine own house , good lady .
Against some part of Poland .
What is ’t o clock
Who commands them , sir
The nephew to old Norway , Fortinbras .
About the ninth hour , lady .
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol
Goes it against the main of Poland , sir , Or for some frontier
Madam , not yet . I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol .
Thou hast some suit to Caesar , hast thou not
Here comes your cousin .
That I have , lady . If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me , I shall beseech him to befriend himself .
My uncle is returned . Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland . Uncle , what news
Why , know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him
The King will bid you battle presently .
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland .
None that I know will be much that I fear may chance . Good morrow to you . Here the street is narrow . The throng that follows Caesar at the heels , Of senators , of praetors , common suitors , Will crowd a feeble man almost to death . I’ll get me to a place more void , and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along .
Lord Douglas , go you and tell him so .
Marry , and shall , and very willingly .
There is no seeming mercy in the King .
Did you beg any God forbid
Then plain and right must my possession be , Which I with more than with a common pain Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain .
I told him gently of our grievances , Of his oath breaking , which he mended thus By now forswearing that he is forsworn . He calls us rebels , traitors , and will scourge With haughty arms this hateful name in us .
Look , look , here comes my John of Lancaster .
Arm , gentlemen , to arms . For I have thrown A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth , And Westmoreland , that was engaged , did bear it , Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on .
Health , peace , and happiness to my royal father .
The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King , And , nephew , challenged you to single fight .
Thou bring’st me happiness and peace , son John , But health , alack , with youthful wings is flown From this bare withered trunk . Upon thy sight My worldly business makes a period . Where is my Lord of Warwick
My Lord of Warwick .
Doth any name particular belong Unto the lodging where I first did swoon
Tis called Jerusalem , my noble lord .
Laud be to God Even there my life must end . It hath been prophesied to me many years , I should not die but in Jerusalem , Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land . But bear me to that chamber there I’ll lie . In that Jerusalem shall Harry die .
Come on , gentle my lord , Sleek o er your rugged looks . Be bright and jovial Among your guests tonight .
So shall I , love , And so , I pray , be you . Let your remembrance Apply to Banquo present him eminence , Both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams , And make our faces vizards to our hearts , Disguising what they are .
You must leave this .
Oh , full of scorpions is my mind , dear wife Thou know’st that Banquo , and his Fleance , lives .
But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne .
There’s comfort yet they are assailable . Then be thou jocund . Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight , ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night’s yawning peal , there shall be done A deed of dreadful note .
What’s to be done
We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs , If any order might be thought upon .
The devil take order now I’ll to the throng . Let life be short , else shame will be too long .
Anger’s my meat I sup upon myself , And so shall starve with feeding . Come , let’s go Leave this faint puling and lament as I do , In anger , Juno like . Come , come , come .
Fie , fie , fie
Be innocent of the knowledge , dearest chuck , Till thou applaud the deed . Come , seeling night , Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale . Light thickens , and the crow Makes wing to th rooky wood . Good things of day begin to droop and drowse Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse . Thou marvel’st at my words but hold thee still . Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill . So , prithee , go with me .
Truly to speak , and with no addition , We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name . To pay five ducats , five , I would not farm it . Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate , should it be sold in fee .
Why , then the Polack never will defend it .
Nay , then
Yes , it is already garrisoned .
Well , well , th event .
O , would the quarrel lay upon our heads , And that no man might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me , tell me , How showed his tasking Seemed it in contempt
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw . This is th impostume of much wealth and peace , That inward breaks and shows no cause without Why the man dies . I humbly thank you , sir .
God be wi you , sir .
No , by my soul . I never in my life Did hear a challenge urged more modestly , Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms . He gave you all the duties of a man , Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue , Spoke your deservings like a chronicle , Making you ever better than his praise By still dispraising praise valued in you , And , which became him like a prince indeed , He made a blushing cital of himself , And chid his truant youth with such a grace As if he mastered there a double spirit Of teaching and of learning instantly . There did he pause but let me tell the world If he outlive the envy of this day , England did never owe so sweet a hope , So much misconstrued in his wantonness .
Will ’t please you go , my lord
Cousin , I think thou art enamorèd On his follies . Never did I hear Of any Prince so wild a liberty . But be he as he will , yet once ere night I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm , That he shall shrink under my courtesy . Arm , arm with speed , and , fellows , soldiers , friends , Better consider what you have to do Than I that have not well the gift of tongue Can lift your blood up with persuasion .
I’ll be with you straight . Go a little before .
How all occasions do inform against me , And spur my dull revenge What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed A beast , no more . Sure , he that made us with such large discourse , Looking before and after , gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unused . Now , whether it be Bestial oblivion , or some craven scruple
By cock and pie , sir , you shall not away tonight . What , Davy , I say
You must excuse me , Master Robert Shallow .
I will not excuse you . You shall not be excused . Excuses shall not be admitted . There is no excuse shall serve . You shall not be excused . Why , Davy
Here , sir .
Davy , Davy , Davy , Davy , let me see , Davy , let me see , Davy , let me see . Yea , marry , William cook , bid him come hither . Sir John , you shall not be excused .
Marry , sir , thus those precepts cannot be served . And again , sir , shall we sow the hade land with wheat
With red wheat , Davy . But for William cook , are there no young pigeons
Yes , sir . Here is now the smith’s note for shoeing and plow irons .
I must go in . Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant . Oh , I grow faint . Run , Lucius , and commend me to my lord . Say I am merry . Come to me again , And bring me word what he doth say to thee .
But who did bid thee join with us
Macbeth .
He needs not our mistrust , since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just .
Then stand with us . The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day . Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn , and near approaches The subject of our watch .
Hark , I hear horses .
Give us a light there , ho
Then ’tis he the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i th court .
His horses go about .
Almost a mile but he does usually So all men do from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk .
A light , a light
Tis he .
Stand to ’t .
It will be rain tonight .
Let it come down .
O treachery Fly , good Fleance , fly , fly , fly Thou may ’st revenge O slave
Who did strike out the light
Was ’t not the way
There’s but one down . The son is fled .
We have lost best half of our affair .
Well , let’s away and say how much is done .
My lord , here are letters for you .
I cannot read them now . O gentlemen , the time of life is short To spend that shortness basely were too long If life did ride upon a dial’s point , Still ending at the arrival of an hour . An if we live , we live to tread on kings If die , brave death , when princes die with us . Now , for our consciences , the arms are fair When the intent of bearing them is just .
My lord , prepare . The King comes on apace .
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale , For I profess not talking . Only this Let each man do his best . And here draw I a sword , Whose temper I intend to stain With the best blood that I can meet withal In the adventure of this perilous day . Now , Esperance Percy And set on . Sound all the lofty instruments of war , And by that music let us all embrace , For , heaven to earth , some of us never shall A second time do such a courtesy .
Of thinking too precisely on th event A thought which , quartered , hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward I do not know Why yet I live to say This thing’s to do , Sith I have cause and will and strength and means To do ’t . Examples gross as earth exhort me . Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince , Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed Makes mouths at the invisible event , Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune , death , and danger dare , Even for an eggshell . Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument , But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honor’s at the stake . How stand I then , That have a father killed , a mother stained , Excitements of my reason and my blood , And let all sleep while , to my shame , I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men , That for a fantasy and trick of fame Go to their graves like beds , fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause , Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain Oh , from this time forth , My thoughts be bloody , or be nothing worth
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters . Acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter . If your diligence be not speedy , I shall be there afore you .
I will not sleep , my lord , till I have delivered your letter .
If a man’s brains were in ’s heels , were ’t not in danger of kibes
Ay , boy .
Then , I prithee , be merry . Thy wit shall ne er go slipshod .
Ha , ha , ha
Let it be cast and paid . Sir John , you shall not be excused .
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly . For though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple , yet I can tell what I can tell .
Why , what canst thou tell , my boy
Now , sir , a new link to the bucket must needs be had . And , sir , do you mean to stop any of William’s wages about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley Fair
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab . Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i th middle on ’s face
He shall answer it . Some pigeons , Davy , a couple of short legged hens , a joint of mutton , and any pretty little tiny kickshaws , tell William cook .
Doth the man of war stay all night , sir
Yea , Davy . I will use him well . A friend i th court is better than a penny in purse . Use his men well , Davy , for they are arrant knaves and will backbite .
You know your own degrees sit down . At first And last , the hearty welcome .
No worse than they are back bitten , sir , for they have marvellous foul linen .
Thanks to your majesty .
Well conceited , Davy . About thy business , Davy .
I beseech you , sir , to countenance William Visor of Woncot against Clement Perkes o th hill .
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host . Our hostess keeps her state , but in best time We will require her welcome .
There is many complaints , Davy , against that Visor . That Visor is an arrant knave , on my knowledge .
Pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , For my heart speaks they are welcome .
I grant your Worship that he is a knave , sir , but yet , God forbid , sir , but a knave should have some countenance at his friend’s request . An honest man , sir , is able to speak for himself when a knave is not . I have served your Worship truly , sir , this eight years an if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man , I have
See , they encounter thee with their hearts thanks . Both sides are even . Here I’ll sit i th midst . Be large in mirth . Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round .
There’s blood upon thy face .
Tis Banquo’s then .
Tis better thee without than he within . Is he dispatched
The ides of March are come .
Ay , Caesar , but not gone .
Hail , Caesar Read this schedule .
Trebonius doth desire you to o er read , At your best leisure , this his humble suit .
O Caesar , read mine first , for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer . Read it , great Caesar .
What touches us ourself shall be last served .
Delay not , Caesar . Read it instantly .
What , is the fellow mad
Sirrah , give place .
What , urge you your petitions in the street Come to the Capitol .
Well have we done , thrice valiant countrymen , But all’s not done . Yet keep the French the field .
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty .
Lives he , good uncle Thrice within this hour I saw him down , thrice up again and fighting . From helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
In which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , Larding the plain , and by his bloody side , Yoke fellow to his honor owing wounds , The noble earl of Suffolk also lies . Suffolk first died , and York , all haggled over , Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face . And cries aloud , Tarry , my cousin Suffolk . My soul shall thine keep company to heaven . Tarry , sweet soul , for mine then fly abreast , As in this glorious and well foughten field We kept together in our chivalry . Upon these words I came and cheered him up . He smiled me in the face , raught me his hand , And with a feeble grip , says Dear my lord , Commend my service to my sovereign . So did he turn , and over Suffolk’s neck
I know you well , sir , and you know me your name , I think , is Adrian .
It is so , sir truly , I have forgot you .
I am a Roman and my services are , as you are , against ’em know you me yet
Nicanor no .
The same , sir .
You had more beard when I last saw you but your favour is well approved by your tongue . What’s the news in Rome I have a note from the Volscian state , to find you out there you have well saved me a day’s journey .
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections the people against the senators , patricians , and nobles .
Hath been is it ended , then Our state thinks not so they are in a most warlike preparation , and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division .
The main blaze of it is past , but a small thing would make it flame again for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus , that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever . This lies glowing , I can tell you , and is almost mature for the violent breaking out .
What is thy name that in the battle thus Thou crossest me What honor dost thou seek Upon my head
Know then , my name is Douglas , And I do haunt thee in the battle thus Because some tell me that thou art a king .
They tell thee true .
The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought Thy likeness , for instead of thee , King Harry , This sword hath ended him . So shall it thee , Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner .
My lord , his throat is cut . That I did for him .
I was not born a yielder , thou proud Scot , And thou shalt find a king that will revenge Lord Stafford’s death .
Thou art the best o th cutthroats Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance . If thou didst it , thou art the nonpareil .
O Douglas , hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus , I never had triumphed upon a Scot .
Most royal sir , Fleance is ’scaped .
All’s done , all’s won here breathless lies the King .
Then comes my fit again . I had else been perfect , Whole as the marble , founded as the rock , As broad and general as the casing air . But now I am cabined , cribbed , confined , bound in To saucy doubts and fears . But Banquo’s safe
Ay , my good lord . Safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head , The least a death to nature .
Thanks for that . There the grown serpent lies . The worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed No teeth for th present . Get thee gone . Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again .
My royal lord , You do not give the cheer . The feast is sold That is not often vouched , while ’tis a making , Tis given with welcome . To feed were best at home From thence , the sauce to meat is ceremony Meeting were bare without it .
I will not speak with her .
She is importunate , Indeed distract . Her mood will needs be pitied .
What would she have
She speaks much of her father , says she hears There’s tricks i th world , and hems , and beats her heart , Spurns enviously at straws , speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense . Her speech is nothing , Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection . They aim at it , And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts , Which , as her winks and nods and gestures yield them , Indeed would make one think there might be thought , Though nothing sure , yet much unhappily .
Twere good she were spoken with , for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill breeding minds .
Let her come in .
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss . So full of artless jealousy is guilt , It spills itself in fearing to be spilt .
a very little credit with your Worship . The knave is mine honest friend , sir therefore I beseech you let him be countenanced .
Go to , I say he shall have no wrong . Look about , Davy .
Where are you , Sir John Come , come , come , off with your boots . Give me your hand , Master Bardolph .
I am glad to see your Worship .
I thank thee with all my heart , kind Master Bardolph , and welcome , my tall fellow . Come , Sir John .
I’ll follow you , good Master Robert Shallow .
Bardolph , look to our horses .
If I were sawed into quantities , I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits staves as Master Shallow . It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits and his . They , by observing of him , do bear themselves like foolish justices he , by conversing with them , is turned into a justice like servingman . Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese . If I had a suit to Master Shallow , I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men , I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants . It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught , as men take diseases , one of another . Therefore let men take heed of their company . I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
Sweet remembrancer Now , good digestion wait on appetite , And health on both
May ’t please your highness sit .
Here had we now our country’s honor roofed , Were the graced person of our Banquo present , Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance .
His absence , sir , Lays blame upon his promise . Please ’t your highness To grace us with your royal company
The table’s full .
Here is a place reserved , sir .
Where
Here , my good lord . What is ’t that moves your highness
Which of you have done this
What , my good lord
Thou canst not say I did it . Never shake Thy gory locks at me .
I wish your enterprise today may thrive .
What enterprise , Popillius
Fare you well .
Where
Here .
This , Douglas No , I know this face full well . A gallant knight he was his name was Blunt , Semblably furnished like the King himself .
A fool go with thy soul whither it goes A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear . Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king
The King hath many marching in his coats .
Now , by my sword , I will kill all his coats . I’ll murder all his wardrobe , piece by piece , Until I meet the King .
Up and away Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day .
Though I could ’scape shot free at London , I fear the shot here . Here’s no scoring but upon the pate . Soft , who are you Sir Walter Blunt . There’s honor for you . Here’s no vanity . I am as hot as molten lead , and as heavy too . God keep lead out of me I need no more weight than mine own bowels . I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered . There’s not three of my hundred and fifty left alive , and they are for the town’s end , to beg during life . But who comes here
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark
How now , Ophelia
How should I your true love know From another one By his cockle hat and staff , And his sandal shoon .
Alas , sweet lady , what imports this song
Gentlemen , rise . His highness is not well .
Say you Nay , pray you , mark . He is dead and gone , lady , He is dead and gone , At his head a grass green turf , At his heels a stone . Oh , ho
Sit , worthy friends . My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth . Pray you , keep seat . The fit is momentary upon a thought He will again be well . If much you note him , You shall offend him and extend his passion . Feed and regard him not . Are you a man
Nay , but , Ophelia
No .
Ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that Which might appall the devil .
Why , to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose , that what a man cannot smell out , he may spy into .
Pray you , mark . White his shroud as the mountain snow
O proper stuff This is the very painting of your fear . This is the air drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan . Oh , these flaws and starts , Impostors to true fear , would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire , Authorized by her grandam . Shame itself Why do you make such faces When all’s done , You look but on a stool .
I did her wrong
Alas , look here , my lord .
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell
Prithee , see there Behold Look Lo How say you Why , what care I If thou canst nod , speak too . If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back , our monuments Shall be the maws of kites .
No .
Larded all with sweet flowers , Which bewept to the ground did not go With true love showers .
What , quite unmanned in folly
Nor I neither . But I can tell why a snail has a house .
Why
Why , to put ’s head in not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case .
I will forget my nature . So kind a father Be my horses ready
Thy asses are gone about em . The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .
Because they are not eight
Yes indeed . Thou wouldst make a good fool .
To take ’t again perforce Monster ingratitude
What said Popillius Lena
He wished today our enterprise might thrive . I fear our purpose is discoverèd .
Look how he makes to Caesar . Mark him .
Casca , be sudden , for we fear prevention Brutus , what shall be done If this be known , Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back , For I will slay myself .
Cassius , be constant . Popillius Lena speaks not of our purposes . For , look , he smiles , and Caesar doth not change .
Trebonius knows his time . For , look you , Brutus . He draws Mark Antony out of the way .
Where is Metellus Cimber Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar .
He threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips , And so , espoused to death , with blood he sealed A testament of noble ending love . The pretty and sweet manner of it forced Those waters from me which I would have stopped , But I had not so much of man in me , And all my mother came into mine eyes And gave me up to tears .
I blame you not , For , hearing this , I must perforce compound With mistful eyes , or they will issue too .
But hark , what new alarum is this same The French have reinforced their scattered men . Then every soldier kill his prisoners . Give the word through .
keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions , which is four terms , or two actions , and a shall laugh without intervallums . O , it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders . O , you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up .
Sir John .
I come , Master Shallow I come , Master Shallow .
If I stand here , I saw him .
Fie , for shame
Blood hath been shed ere now , i th olden time , Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal Ay , and since too , murders have been performed Too terrible for the ear . The time has been That , when the brains were out , the man would die , And there an end . But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools . This is more strange Than such a murder is .
My worthy lord , Your noble friends do lack you .
I do forget . Do not muse at me , my most worthy friends . I have a strange infirmity , which is nothing To those that know me . Come , love and health to all . Then I’ll sit down . Give me some wine . Fill full .
I drink to the general joy o th whole table , And to our dear friend Banquo , whom we miss Would he were here To all and him we thirst , And all to all .
Our duties , and the pledge .
Coriolanus banished
Banished , sir .
You will be welcome with this intelligence , Nicanor .
The day serves well for them now . I have heard it said , the fittest time to corrupt a man’s wife is when she’s fallen out with her husband . Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars , his great opposer , Coriolanus , being now in no request of his country .
He cannot choose . I am most fortunate , thus accidentally to encounter you you have ended my business , and I will merrily accompany you home .
I shall , between this and supper , tell you most strange things from Rome all tending to the good of their adversaries . Have you an army ready , say you
A most royal one the centurions and their charges , distinctly billeted , already in the entertainment , and to be on foot at an hour’s warning .
I am joyful to hear of their readiness , and am the man , I think , that shall set them in present action . So , sir , heartily well met , and most glad of your company .
You take my part from me , sir I have the most cause to be glad of yours .
What , stand’st thou idle here Lend me thy sword . Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies , Whose deaths are yet unrevenged . I prithee , Lend me thy sword .
O Hal , I prithee , give me leave to breathe awhile . Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day . I have paid Percy I have made him sure .
He is indeed , and living to kill thee . I prithee , lend me thy sword .
Nay , before God , Hal , if Percy be alive , thou gett’st not my sword but take my pistol , if thou wilt .
Give it to me . What , is it in the case
Ay , Hal , ’tis hot , ’tis hot . There’s that will sack a city .
What , is it a time to jest and dally now
Well , if Percy be alive , I’ll pierce him . If he do come in my way , so if he do not , if I come in his willingly , let him make a carbonado of me . I like not such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath . Give me life , which if I can save , so if not , honor comes unlooked for , and there’s an end .
Avaunt , and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee . Thy bones are marrowless , thy blood is cold . Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with
Think of this , good peers , But as a thing of custom . Tis no other Only it spoils the pleasure of the time .
What man dare , I dare . Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear , The armed rhinoceros , or th Hyrcan tiger Take any shape but that , and my firm nerves Shall never tremble . Or be alive again , And dare me to the desert with thy sword . If trembling I inhabit then , protest me The baby of a girl . Hence , horrible shadow Unreal mockery , hence
Why so , being gone ,
Why so , being gone , I am a man again . Pray you sit still .
You have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , With most admired disorder .
Can such things be , And overcome us like a summer’s cloud , Without our special wonder You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe , When now I think you can behold such sights , And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks , When mine is blanched with fear .
What sights , my lord
If thou wert my fool , nuncle , I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time .
How now , my Lord Chief Justice , whither away
How’s that
How doth the King
Exceeding well . His cares are now all ended .
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
I hope , not dead .
O , let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heaven I would not be mad . Keep me in temper . I would not be mad .
He’s walked the way of nature , And to our purposes he lives no more .
How now Are the horses ready
I would his Majesty had called me with him . The service that I truly did his life Hath left me open to all injuries .
How do you , pretty lady
Indeed , I think the young King loves you not .
Well , God ield you They say the owl was a baker’s daughter . Lord , we know what we are , but know not what we may be . God be at your table .
I know he doth not , and do arm myself To welcome the condition of the time , Which cannot look more hideously upon me Than I have drawn it in my fantasy .
Conceit upon her father .
Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry . O , that the living Harry had the temper Of he the worst of these three gentlemen How many nobles then should hold their places That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
Pray you , let’s have no words of this , but when they ask you what it means , say you this Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day , All in the morning betime , And I a maid at your window , To be your Valentine . Then up he rose , and donned his clothes , And dupped the chamber door . Let in the maid that out a maid Never departed more .
Pretty Ophelia
Indeed , without an oath I’ll make an end on ’t By Gis and by Saint Charity , Alack , and fie , for shame Young men will do ’t , if they come to ’t . By Cock , they are to blame . Quoth she , Before you tumbled me , You promised me to wed . He answers , So would I ha done , by yonder sun , An thou hadst not come to my bed .
He is addressed . Press near and second him .
Casca , you are the first that rears your hand .
Are we all ready What is now amiss That Caesar and his senate must redress
Most high , most mighty , and most puissant Caesar , Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart
I must prevent thee , Cimber . These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children . Be not fond , To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools I mean , sweet words , Low crookèd curtsies , and base spaniel fawning . Thy brother by decree is banishèd . If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him , I spurn thee like a cur out of my way . Know , Caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause Will he be satisfied .
Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother
I kiss thy hand , but not in flattery , Caesar , Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal .
I pray you , speak not . He grows worse and worse . Question enrages him . At once , good night . Stand not upon the order of your going , But go at once .
Good night , and better health Attend his majesty
A kind good night to all
It will have blood , they say . Blood will have blood . Stones have been known to move , and trees to speak . Augurs and understood relations have By magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret’st man of blood . What is the night
Ready , my lord .
Almost at odds with morning , which is which .
Come , boy .
How say’st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding
She that’s a maid now and laughs at my departure , Shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter .
Did you send to him , sir
I hear it by the way but I will send . There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d . I will tomorrow And betimes I will to the weird sisters . More shall they speak , for now I am bent to know , By the worst means , the worst . For mine own good , All causes shall give way . I am in blood Stepped in so far that , should I wade no more , Returning were as tedious as go o er . Strange things I have in head , that will to hand , Which must be acted ere they may be scanned .
I prithee , Harry , withdraw thyself . Thou bleedest too much . Lord John of Lancaster , go you with him .
Not I , my lord , unless I did bleed too .
I beseech your Majesty , make up , Lest your retirement do amaze your friends .
I will do so . My Lord of Westmoreland , Lead him to his tent .
Come , my lord , I’ll lead you to your tent .
Lead me , my lord I do not need your help , And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive The Prince of Wales from such a field as this , Where stained nobility lies trodden on , And rebels arms triumph in massacres .
We breathe too long . Come , cousin Westmoreland , Our duty this way lies . For God’s sake , come .
By God , thou hast deceived me , Lancaster . I did not think thee lord of such a spirit . Before , I loved thee as a brother , John , But now , I do respect thee as my soul .
You lack the season of all natures , sleep .
Kill the poys and the luggage Tis expressly against the law of arms . Tis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offert , in your conscience now , is it not
Come , we’ll to sleep . My strange and self abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use . We are yet but young in deed .
Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive , and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha done this slaughter . Besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat . Oh , ’tis a gallant king
Ay , he was porn at Monmouth , Captain Gower . What call you the town’s name where Alexander the Pig was born
Alexander the Great .
Why , I pray you , is not pig great The pig , or the great , or the mighty , or the huge , or the magnanimous are all one reckonings , save the phrase is a little variations .
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon . His father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn . I tell you , Captain , if you look in the maps of the orld , I warrant you shall find , in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike .
How long hath she been thus
I hope all will be well . We must be patient , but I cannot choose but weep , to think they should lay him i th cold ground . My brother shall know of it , and so I thank you for your good counsel . Come , my coach Good night , ladies . Good night , sweet ladies . Good night , good night .
Follow her close . Give her good watch , I pray you .
Oh , this is the poison of deep grief . It springs All from her father’s death , and now behold O Gertrude , Gertrude , When sorrows come , they come not single spies But in battalions . First , her father slain . Next , your son gone , and he most violent author Of his own just remove . The people muddied , Thick , and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good Polonius death , and we have done but greenly In hugger mugger to inter him . Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment , Without the which we are pictures , or mere beasts . Last and as much containing as all these Her brother is in secret come from France , Feeds on his wonder , keeps himself in clouds , And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father’s death , Wherein necessity , of matter beggared , Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear . O my dear Gertrude , this , Like to a murdering piece , in many places Gives me superfluous death .
O God , I fear all will be overturned .
Why , how now , Hecate You look angerly .
Good morrow , cousin Warwick , good morrow .
Good morrow , cousin .
Have I not reason , beldams as you are Saucy and overbold , how did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death , And I , the mistress of your charms , The close contriver of all harms , Was never called to bear my part , Or show the glory of our art And , which is worse , all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son , Spiteful and wrathful , who , as others do , Loves for his own ends , not for you . But make amends now . Get you gone , And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i th morning . Thither he Will come to know his destiny . Your vessels and your spells provide , Your charms and everything beside . I am for the air . This night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end . Great business must be wrought ere noon . Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap rous drop profound . I’ll catch it ere it come to ground . And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion .
Well , let us go together .
We meet like men that had forgot to speak .
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point With lustier maintenance than I did look for Of such an ungrown warrior .
O , this boy lends mettle to us all .
Another king they grow like Hydra’s heads . I am the Douglas , fatal to all those That wear those colors on them . What art thou That counterfeit’st the person of a king
The King himself , who , Douglas , grieves at heart , So many of his shadows thou hast met And not the very king . I have two boys Seek Percy and thyself about the field , But , seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily , I will assay thee . And defend thyself .
I fear thou art another counterfeit , And yet , in faith , thou bear’st thee like a king . But mine I am sure thou art , whoe er thou be , And thus I win thee .
We do remember , but our argument Is all too heavy to admit much talk .
Well , peace be with him that hath made us heavy .
Hold up thy head , vile Scot , or thou art like Never to hold it up again . The spirits Of valiant Shirley , Stafford , Blunt are in my arms . It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee , Who never promiseth but he means to pay .
Peace be with us , lest we be heavier .
O , good my lord , you have lost a friend indeed , And I dare swear you borrow not that face Of seeming sorrow it is sure your own .
Though no man be assured what grace to find , You stand in coldest expectation . I am the sorrier would ’twere otherwise .
Well , you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair , Which swims against your stream of quality .
Sweet princes , what I did I did in honor , Led by th impartial conduct of my soul And never shall you see that I will beg A ragged and forestalled remission . If truth and upright innocency fail me , I’ll to the King my master that is dead And tell him who hath sent me after him .
Save thee , Curan .
And you , sir . I have been with your father and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night .
How comes that
Nay , I know not . You have heard of the news abroad I mean the whispered ones , for they are yet but ear kissing arguments .
Not I . Pray you , what are they
Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany
Not a word .
You may do then in time . Fare you well , sir .
The duke be here tonight The better best This weaves itself perforce into my business . My father hath set guard to take my brother . And I have one thing , of a queasy question , Which I must act . Briefness and fortune , work Brother , a word . Descend , brother , I say .
There is a river in Macedon , and there is also , moreover , a river at Monmouth . It is called Wye at Monmouth , but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river . But ’tis all one ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both . If you mark Alexander’s life well , Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well , for there is figures in all things . Alexander , God knows and you know , in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a little intoxicates in his prains , did , in his ales and his angers , look you , kill his best friend , Cleitus .
Our king is not like him in that . He never killed any of his friends .
It is not well done , mark you now , to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished . I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it . As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus , being in his ales and his cups , so also Harry Monmouth , being in his right wits and his good judgments , turned away the fat knight with the great belly doublet he was full of jests , and gipes and knaveries , and mocks I have forgot his name .
Sir John Falstaff .
That is he . I’ll tell you , there is good men porn at Monmouth .
Here comes his Majesty .
What , Brutus
Pardon , Caesar . Caesar , pardon . As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber .
I could be well moved if I were as you . If I could pray to move , prayers would move me . But I am constant as the northern star , Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament . The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks . They are all fire and every one doth shine , But there’s but one in all doth hold his place . So in the world . Tis furnished well with men , And men are flesh and blood , and apprehensive , Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank , Unshaked of motion . And that I am he Let me a little show it even in this That I was constant Cimber should be banished , And constant do remain to keep him so .
O Caesar
Hence Wilt thou lift up Olympus
Great Caesar
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
Speak , hands , for me
He shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear His hopes bove wisdom , grace , and fear . And you all know , security Is mortals chiefest enemy .
A goodly city is this Antium . City , ’Tis I that made thy widows many an heir Of these fair edifices ’fore my wars Have I heard groan and drop then know me not , Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones In puny battle slay me .
Hark I am called . My little spirit , see , Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me .
Save you , sir .
Come , let’s make haste she’ll soon be back again .
And you .
Direct me , if it be your will , Where great Aufidius lies is he in Antium
He is , and feasts the nobles of the state At his house this night .
Which is his house , beseech you
This , here before you .
Thank you , sir farewell .
O world , thy slippery turns Friends now fast sworn , Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart , Whose house , whose bed , whose meal , and exercise , Are still together , who twin , as ’twere , in love Unseparable , shall within this hour , On a dissension of a doit , break out To bitterest enmity so , fellest foes , Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep , To take the one the other , by some chance , Some trick not worth an egg , shall grow dear friends And interjoin their issues . So with me My birth place hate I , and my love’s upon This enemy town . I’ll enter if he slay me , He does fair justice if he give me way , I’ll do his country service .
Cheerly , my lord . How fares your Grace Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent , And so hath Clifton . I’ll to Clifton straight .
Stay , and breathe awhile . Thou hast redeemed thy lost opinion And showed thou mak’st some tender of my life In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me .
O God , they did me too much injury That ever said I hearkened for your death . If it were so , I might have let alone The insulting hand of Douglas over you , Which would have been as speedy in your end As all the poisonous potions in the world , And saved the treacherous labor of your son .
Make up to Clifton . I’ll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey .
If I mistake not , thou art Harry Monmouth .
Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name .
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant . Take a trumpet , herald . Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill . If they will fight with us , bid them come down , Or void the field . They do offend our sight . If they’ll do neither , we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforcèd from the old Assyrian slings . Besides , we’ll cut the throats of those we have , And not a man of them that we shall take Shall taste our mercy . Go and tell them so .
My name is Harry Percy .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
Why , then I see A very valiant rebel of the name . I am the Prince of Wales and think not , Percy , To share with me in glory any more . Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere , Nor can one England brook a double reign , Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales .
His eyes are humbler than they used to be .
How now , what means this , herald Know’st thou not That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom Com’st thou again for ransom
No , great king . I come to thee for charitable license , That we may wander o er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them To sort our nobles from our common men , For many of our princes woe the while Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood . So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes , and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore , and with wild rage Yerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters , Killing them twice . Oh , give us leave , great king , To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies .
Alack , what noise is this
Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door .
What is the matter
Save yourself , my lord . The ocean , overpeering of his list , Eats not the flats with more impiteous haste Than young Laertes , in a riotous head , O erbears your officers . The rabble call him lord And as the world were now but to begin , Antiquity forgot , custom not known , The ratifiers and props of every word They cry , Choose we Laertes shall be king Caps , hands , and tongues applaud it to the clouds Laertes shall be king , Laertes king
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry . O , this is counter , you false Danish dogs
The doors are broke .
Here comes the Prince .
Good morrow , and God save your Majesty .
This new and gorgeous garment majesty Sits not so easy on me as you think . Brothers , you mix your sadness with some fear . This is the English , not the Turkish court Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds , But Harry Harry . Yet be sad , good brothers , For , by my faith , it very well becomes you . Sorrow so royally in you appears That I will deeply put the fashion on And wear it in my heart . Why then , be sad . But entertain no more of it , good brothers , Than a joint burden laid upon us all . For me , by heaven , I bid you be assured , I’ll be your father and your brother too . Let me but bear your love , I ’ll bear your cares . Yet weep that Harry’s dead , and so will I , But Harry lives that shall convert those tears By number into hours of happiness .
We hope no otherwise from your Majesty .
You all look strangely on me . And you most . You are , I think , assured I love you not .
My father watches . O sir , fly this place . Intelligence is given where you are hid . You have now the good advantage of the night . Have you not spoken gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught He’s coming hither now , i th night , i th haste , And Regan with him . Have you nothing said Upon his party gainst the Duke of Albany Advise yourself .
I am assured , if I be measured rightly , Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me .
I am sure on ’t , not a word .
I hear my father coming . Pardon me . In cunning I must draw my sword upon you . Draw . Seem to defend yourself . Now quit you well . So , farewell .
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion . Of my more fierce endeavor . I have seen drunkards Do more than this in sport . Father , father Stop , stop No help
Now Edmund , where’s the villain
I tell thee truly , herald , I know not if the day be ours or no , For yet a many of your horsemen peer And gallop o er the field .
The day is yours .
Praised be God , and not our strength , for it What is this castle called that stands hard by
They call it Agincourt .
Then call we this the field of Agincourt , Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
Your grandfather of famous memory , an’t please your Majesty , and your great uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales , as I have read in the chronicles , fought a most prave pattle here in France .
They did , Fluellen .
Your Majesty says very true . If your Majesties is remembered of it , the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps , which , your Majesty know , to this hour is an honorable badge of the service . And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day .
Nor shall it , Harry , for the hour is come To end the one of us , and would to God Thy name in arms were now as great as mine .
I’ll make it greater ere I part from thee , And all the budding honors on thy crest I’ll crop , to make a garland for my head .
I can no longer brook thy vanities .
Well said , Hal To it Hal Nay , you shall find no boys play here , I can tell you .
O Harry , thou hast robbed me of my youth . I better brook the loss of brittle life Than those proud titles thou hast won of me . They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh . But thoughts , the slave of life , and life , time’s fool , And time , that takes survey of all the world , Must have a stop . O , I could prophesy , But that the earthy and cold hand of death Lies on my tongue . No , Percy , thou art dust , And food for
Et tu , Bruté Then fall , Caesar .
Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead Run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .
Some to the common pulpits , and cry out , Liberty , freedom , and enfranchisement
People and senators , be not affrighted . Fly not . Stand still . Ambition’s debt is paid .
Go to the pulpit , Brutus .
And Cassius too .
Where’s Publius
Here , quite confounded with this mutiny .
Stand fast together , lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance
Talk not of standing . Publius , good cheer . There is no harm intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else . So tell them , Publius .
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts , Which can interpret farther . Only I say Things have been strangely borne . The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth . Marry , he was dead . And the right valiant Banquo walked too late , Whom , you may say , if ’t please you , Fleance killed , For Fleance fled . Men must not walk too late . Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father Damnèd fact How it did grieve Macbeth Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep Was not that nobly done Ay , and wisely too , For ’twould have angered any heart alive To hear the men deny ’t . So that , I say , He has borne all things well . And I do think That had he Duncan’s sons under his key As , an’t please heaven , he shall not they should find What ’twere to kill a father . So should Fleance . But , peace For from broad words , and cause he failed His presence at the tyrant’s feast , I hear Macduff lives in disgrace . Sir , can you tell Where he bestows himself
Where is this king Sirs , stand you all without .
No , let’s come in
I pray you , give me leave .
We will , we will .
I thank you . Keep the door . O thou vile king , Give me my father
Here stood he in the dark , his sharp sword out , Mumbling of wicked charms , conjuring the moon To stand ’s auspicious mistress
Calmly , good Laertes .
But where is he
That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard , Cries Cuckold to my father , brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unsmirchèd brow Of my true mother .
Look , sir , I bleed .
Where is the villain , Edmund
What is the cause , Laertes , That thy rebellion looks so giant like Let him go , Gertrude . Do not fear our person . There’s such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would , Acts little of his will . Tell me , Laertes , Why thou art thus incensed . Let him go , Gertrude . Speak , man .
Fled this way , sir , when by no means he could
Where is my father
Pursue him , ho Go after .
Dead .
By no means what
But not by him .
Let him demand his fill .
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship , But that I told him the revenging gods Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend , Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond The child was bound to th father . Sir , in fine , Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose , in fell motion , With his preparèd sword he charges home My unprovided body , latched mine arm . And when he saw my best alarumed spirits , Bold in the quarrel’s right , roused to the encounter , Or whether ghasted by the noise I made , Full suddenly he fled .
Let him fly far . Not in this land shall he remain uncaught . And found dispatch . The noble duke my master , My worthy arch and patron , comes tonight .
I wear it for a memorable honor , For I am Welsh , you know , good countryman .
All the water in Wye cannot wash your Majesty’s Welsh plood out of your pody , I can tell you that God pless it and preserve it as long as it pleases his Grace and his Majesty too .
Thanks , good my countryman .
By Jeshu , I am your Majesty’s countryman , I care not who know it . I will confess it to all the orld . I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty , praised be God , so long as your Majesty is an honest man .
God keep me so . Our heralds go with him . Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts . Call yonder fellow hither .
Soldier , you must come to the king .
Soldier , why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap
An’t please your Majesty , ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal , if he be alive .
An Englishman
An ’t please your Majesty , a rascal that swaggered with me last night , who , if alive and ever dare to challenge this glove , I have sworn to take him a box o th ear , or if I can see my glove in his cap , which he swore , as he was a soldier , he would wear if alive , I will strike it out soundly .
And leave us , Publius , lest that the people , Rushing on us , should do your age some mischief .
Do so . And let no man abide this deed But we the doers .
Where is Antony
Fled to his house amazed . Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run As it were doomsday .
Fates , we will know your pleasures . That we shall die , we know . Tis but the time , And drawing days out , that men stand upon .
Why , he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death .
Grant that , and then is death a benefit . So are we Caesar’s friends , that have abridged His time of fearing death . Stoop , Romans , stoop , And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows , and besmear our swords . Then walk we forth , even to the marketplace , And waving our red weapons o er our heads Let’s all cry , Peace , freedom , and liberty
Stoop , then , and wash .
By his authority I will proclaim it That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks , Bringing the murderous coward to the stake . He that conceals him , death .
For worms , brave Percy . Fare thee well , great heart . Ill weaved ambition , how much art thou shrunk When that this body did contain a spirit , A kingdom for it was too small a bound , But now two paces of the vilest earth Is room enough . This earth that bears thee dead Bears not alive so stout a gentleman . If thou wert sensible of courtesy , I should not make so dear a show of zeal . But let my favors hide thy mangled face And even in thy behalf I’ll thank myself For doing these fair rites of tenderness . Adieu , and take thy praise with thee to heaven . Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave , But not remembered in thy epitaph .
When I dissuaded him from his intent , And found him pight to do it , with cursed speech I threatened to discover him . He replied , Thou unpossessing bastard Dost thou think If I would stand against thee , would the reposal Of any trust , virtue , or worth in thee Make thy words faithed No . What I should deny As this I would , ay , though thou didst produce My very character I’d turn it all To thy suggestion , plot , and damnèd practice . And thou must make a dullard of the world , If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spirits To make thee seek it .
What , old acquaintance , could not all this flesh Keep in a little life Poor Jack , farewell . I could have better spared a better man . O , I should have a heavy miss of thee If I were much in love with vanity . Death hath not struck so fat a deer today , Though many dearer in this bloody fray . Emboweled will I see thee by and by Till then in blood by noble Percy lie .
O strange and fastened villain Would he deny his letter , said he I never got him . Hark , the duke’s trumpets . I know not why he comes . All ports I’ll bar . The villain shall not ’scape . The duke must grant me that . Besides , his picture I will send far and near , that all the kingdom May have the due note of him . And of my land , Loyal and natural boy , I’ll work the means To make thee capable .
How now , my noble friend Since I came hither , Which I can call but now , I have heard strange news .
Emboweled If thou embowel me today , I’ll give you leave to powder me and eat me too tomorrow . Sblood , ’twas time
The son of Duncan From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect . Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward , That by the help of these with Him above To ratify the work we may again Give to our tables meat , sleep to our nights , Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives , Do faithful homage and receive free honors . All which we pine for now . And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war .
Wine , wine , wine What service is here I think our fellows are asleep .
Where’s Cotus my master calls for him . Cotus
A goodly house the feast smells well but I Appear not like a guest .
What would you have , friend whence are you Here’s no place for you pray , go to the door .
I have deserved no better entertainment , In being Coriolanus .
How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown
Whence are you , sir Has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions Pray , get you out .
Away
If it be true , all vengeance comes too short Which can pursue th offender . How dost , my lord
What think you , Captain Fluellen , is it fit this soldier keep his oath
O madam , my old heart is cracked , it’s cracked .
He is a craven and a villain else , an ’t please your Majesty , in my conscience .
What , did my father’s godson seek your life He whom my father named , your Edgar
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .
O , lady , lady , shame would have it hid .
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is , as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself , it is necessary , look your Grace , that he keep his vow and his oath . If he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth , in my conscience , la .
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father
Then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meet’st the fellow .
I know not , madam . Tis too bad , too bad .
So I will , my liege , as I live .
Yes , madam , he was of that consort .
Who serv’st thou under
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
No marvel then , though he were ill affected . Tis they have put him on the old man’s death , To have th expense and spoil of his revenues . I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there .
Gower is a good captain , and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars .
Nor I , assure thee , Regan . Edmund , I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office .
Call him hither to me , soldier .
It was my duty , sir .
I will , my liege .
He did bewray his practice , and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
Is he pursued
No How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me What , rate , rebuke , and roughly send to prison Th immediate heir of England Was this easy May this be washed in Lethe and forgotten
to counterfeit , or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too . Counterfeit I lie . I am no counterfeit . To die is to be a counterfeit , for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit , but the true and perfect image of life indeed . The better part of valor is discretion , in the which better part I have saved my life . Zounds , I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy , though he be dead . How if he should counterfeit too and rise By my faith , I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit . Therefore I’ll make him sure , yea , and I’ll swear I killed him . Why may not he rise as well as I Nothing confutes me but eyes , and nobody sees me . Therefore , sirrah ,
I then did use the person of your father The image of his power lay then in me . And in th administration of his law , Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth , Your Highness pleasèd to forget my place , The majesty and power of law and justice , The image of the King whom I presented , And struck me in my very seat of judgment , Whereon , as an offender to your father , I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you . If the deed were ill , Be you contented , wearing now the garland , To have a son set your decrees at nought To pluck down justice from your awful bench To trip the course of law and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person Nay more , to spurn at your most royal image And mock your workings in a second body Question your royal thoughts , make the case yours Be now the father and propose a son , Hear your own dignity so much profaned , See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted , Behold yourself so by a son disdained , And then imagine me taking your part And in your power soft silencing your son . After this cold considerance , sentence me , And , as you are a king , speak in your state
Come , brother John . Full bravely hast thou fleshed Thy maiden sword .
But soft , whom have we here Did you not tell me this fat man was dead
I did I saw him dead , Breathless and bleeding on the ground . Art thou alive Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight I prithee , speak . We will not trust our eyes Without our ears . Thou art not what thou seem’st .
No , that’s certain . I am not a double man . But if I be not Jack Falstaff , then am I a jack . There is Percy . If your father will do me any honor , so if not , let him kill the next Percy himself . I look to be either earl or duke , I can assure you .
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport , That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust
So oft as that shall be , So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty .
What , shall we forth
Ay , every man away . Brutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome .
Soft Who comes here A friend of Antony’s .
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down , And , being prostrate , thus he bade me say Brutus is noble , wise , valiant , and honest . Caesar was mighty , bold , royal , and loving . Say I love Brutus , and I honor him . Say I feared Caesar , honored him , and loved him .
Here , Fluellen , wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap . When Alençon and myself were down together , I plucked this glove from his helm . If any man challenge this , he is a friend to Alençon and an enemy to our person . If thou encounter any such , apprehend him , an thou dost me love .
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects . I would fain see the man that has but two legs that shall find himself aggrieved at this glove , that is all but I would fain see it once , an please God of his Grace that I might see .
Know’st thou Gower
He is my dear friend , an please you .
Pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
I will fetch him .
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , Follow Fluellen closely at the heels . The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o th ear . It is the soldier’s . I by bargain should Wear it myself . Follow , good cousin Warwick .
Sent he to Macduff
He did , and with an absolute Sir , not I , The cloudy messenger turns me his back , And hums , as who should say You’ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer .
And that well might Advise him to a caution , t hold what distance His wisdom can provide . Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come , that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed
I’ll send my prayers with him .
Why , Percy I killed myself , and saw thee dead .
Didst thou Lord , Lord , how this world is given to lying . I grant you , Iwas down and out of breath , and so was he , but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock . If I may be believed , so if not , let them that should reward valor bear the sin upon their own heads . I’ll take it upon my death , I gave him this wound in the thigh . If the man were alive and would deny it , zounds , I would make him eat a piece of my sword .
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard .
This is the strangest fellow , brother John . Come , bring your luggage nobly on your back . For my part , if a lie may do thee grace , I’ll gild it with the happiest terms I have .
The trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours . Come , brother , let us to the highest of the field To see what friends are living , who are dead .
I’ll follow , as they say , for reward . He that rewards me , God reward him . If I do grow great , I’ll grow less , for I’ll purge and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do .
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death , Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living , but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith . So says my master Antony .
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman . I never thought him worse . Tell him , so please him come unto this place , He shall be satisfied and , by my honor , Depart untouched .
I’ll fetch him presently .
I know that we shall have him well to friend .
I wish we may . But yet have I a mind That fears him much , and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose .
Ay , my good lord .
But here comes Antony . Welcome , Mark Antony .
If he be taken , he shall never more Be feared of doing harm . Make your own purpose How in my strength you please . For you , Edmund , Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant So much commend itself , you shall be ours . Natures of such deep trust we shall much need . You we first seize on .
O mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low Are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well . I know not , gentlemen , what you intend , Who else must be let blood , who else is rank .
I shall serve you , sir , Truly , however else .
For him I thank your grace .
You know not why we came to visit you
Thus out of season , threading dark eyed night . Occasions , noble Gloucester , of some poise , Wherein we must have use of your advice Our father he hath writ , so hath our sister , Of differences , which I least thought it fit To answer from our home . The several messengers From hence attend dispatch . Our good old friend , Lay comforts to your bosom , and bestow Your needful counsel to our business , Which craves the instant use .
I serve you , madam . Your graces are right welcome .
If I myself , there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour , nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords , made rich With the most noble blood of all this world . I do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , Now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , Fulfill your pleasure . Live a thousand years , I shall not find myself so apt to die . No place will please me so , no mean of death , As here by Caesar , and by you cut off , The choice and master spirits of this age .
How came he dead I’ll not be juggled with . To hell , allegiance Vows , to the blackest devil Conscience and grace , to the profoundest pit I dare damnation . To this point I stand That both the worlds I give to negligence . Let come what comes , only I’ll be revenged Most thoroughly for my father .
Who shall stay you
O Antony , beg not your death of us . Though now we must appear bloody and cruel As by our hands and this our present act You see we do yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done . Our hearts you see not . They are pitiful . And pity to the general wrong of Rome As fire drives out fire , so pity pity Hath done this deed on Caesar . For your part , To you our swords have leaden points , Mark Antony . Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers temper do receive you in With all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
My will , not all the world . And for my means , I’ll husband them so well , They shall go far with little .
Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities .
Good Laertes , If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father’s death , is ’t writ in your revenge , That , swoopstake , you will draw both friend and foe , Winner and loser
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude , beside themselves with fear , And then we will deliver you the cause , Why I , that did love Caesar when I struck him , Have thus proceeded .
None but his enemies .
Will you know them then
To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms And , like the kind life rendering pelican , Repast them with my blood .
Why , now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman . That I am guiltless of your father’s death And am most sensible in grief for it , It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye .
If that the soldier strike him , as I judge By his blunt bearing he will keep his word , Some sudden mischief may arise of it , For I do know Fluellen valiant And , touched with choler , hot as gunpowder , And quickly will return an injury . Follow , and see there be no harm between them . Go you with me , uncle of Exeter .
Away get you away .
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed .
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke . Ill spirited Worcester , did not we send grace , Pardon , and terms of love to all of you And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary , Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust Three knights upon our party slain today , A noble earl , and many a creature else Had been alive this hour , If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne Betwixt our armies true intelligence .
What I have done my safety urged me to . And I embrace this fortune patiently , Since not to be avoided it falls on me .
Bear Worcester to the death , and Vernon too . Other offenders we will pause upon .
How goes the field
The noble Scot , Lord Douglas , when he saw The fortune of the day quite turned from him , The noble Percy slain , and all his men Upon the foot of fear , fled with the rest , And , falling from a hill , he was so bruised That the pursuers took him . At my tent The Douglas is , and I beseech your Grace I may dispose of him .
What I have done that misbecame my place , My person , or my liege’s sovereignty .
You are right , justice , and you weigh this well . Therefore still bear the balance and the sword . And I do wish your honors may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you and obey you as I did . So shall I live to speak my father’s words Happy am I that have a man so bold That dares do justice on my proper son And not less happy , having such a son That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice . You did commit me , For which I do commit into your hand Th unstainèd sword that you have used to bear , With this remembrance that you use the same With the like bold , just , and impartial spirit As you have done gainst me . There is my hand . You shall be as a father to my youth , My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear , And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well practiced wise directions . And , princes all , believe me , I beseech you My father is gone wild into his grave , For in his tomb lie my affections , And with his spirit sadly I survive To mock the expectation of the world , To frustrate prophecies , and to raze out Rotten opinion , who hath writ me down After my seeming . The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now . Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea , Where it shall mingle with the state of floods And flow henceforth in formal majesty . Now call we our high court of parliament ,
Thrice , and once the hedge pig whined .
Harpier cries , Tis time , ’tis time .
Round about the cauldron go , In the poisoned entrails throw . Toad , that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty one Sweltered venom sleeping got , Boil thou first i th charmèd pot .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
Fillet of a fenny snake , In the cauldron boil and bake . Eye of newt and toe of frog , Wool of bat and tongue of dog , Adder’s fork and blind worm’s sting , Lizard’s leg and owlet’s wing , For a charm of powerful trouble , Like a hell broth boil and bubble .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
I doubt not of your wisdom . Let each man render me his bloody hand . First , Marcus Brutus , will I shake with you . Next , Caius Cassius , do I take your hand . Now , Decius Brutus , yours . Now yours , Metellus . Yours , Cinna . And , my valiant Casca , yours . Though last , not last in love , yours , good Trebonius . Gentlemen all , alas , what shall I say My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me , Either a coward or a flatterer That I did love thee , Caesar , O , ’tis true . If then thy spirit look upon us now , Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace , Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes Most noble in the presence of thy corse Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds , Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood , It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies . Pardon me , Julius Here wast thou bayed , brave hart Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand , Signed in thy spoil , and crimsoned in thy lethe . O world , thou wast the forest to this hart , And this indeed , O world , the heart of thee . How like a deer , strucken by many princes , Dost thou here lie
Mark Antony
Pardon me , Caius Cassius . The enemies of Caesar shall say this Then , in a friend , it is cold modesty .
Now thou’rt troublesome .
Are you so brave I’ll have you talked with anon .
What fellow’s this
A strange one as ever I looked on I cannot get him out of the house prithee , call my master to him .
What have you to do here , fellow Pray you , avoid the house .
Let me but stand I will not hurt your hearth .
What are you
A gentleman .
A marvellous poor one .
True , so I am .
Pray you , poor gentleman , take up some other station here’s no place for you pray you , avoid come .
Follow your function , go , and batten on cold bits .
What , you will not Prithee , tell my master what a strange guest he has here .
And I shall .
Good dawning to thee , friend . Art of this house
Ay .
Where may we set our horses
I th mire .
Prithee , if thou lovest me , tell me .
I love thee not .
Why , then , I care not for thee .
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold , I would make thee care for me .
Why dost thou use me thus I know thee not .
Fellow , I know thee .
What dost thou know me for
A knave , a rascal , an eater of broken meats a base , proud , shallow , beggarly , three suited , hundred pound , filthy , worsted stocking knave a lily livered , action taking knave a whoreson , glass gazing , super serviceable finical rogue one trunk inheriting slave one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service and art nothing but the composition of a knave , beggar , coward , pander , and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition .
I warrant it is to knight you , Captain .
God’s will and His pleasure , Captain , I beseech you now , come apace to the king . There is more good toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of .
Sir , know you this glove
Know the glove I know the glove is a glove .
I know this , and thus I challenge it .
Sblood , an arrant traitor as any ’s in the universal world , or in France , or in England
How now , sir You villain
Do you think I’ll be forsworn
Stand away , Captain Gower . I will give treason his payment into plows , I warrant you .
I am no traitor .
That’s a lie in thy throat . I charge you in his Majesty’s name , apprehend him . He’s a friend of the Duke Alençon’s .
Scale of dragon , tooth of wolf , Witches mummy , maw and gulf Of the ravined salt sea shark , Root of hemlock digged i th dark , Liver of blaspheming Jew , Gall of goat and slips of yew Slivered in the moon’s eclipse , Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips , Finger of birth strangled babe Ditch delivered by a drab , Make the gruel thick and slab . Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron , For the ingredients of our cauldron .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
Why , what a monstrous fellow art thou , thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee
What a brazen faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king Draw , you rogue , for though it be night yet the moon shines . I’ll make a sop o th moonshine of you . Draw , you whoreson cullionly barber monger , draw
Away I have nothing to do with thee .
Cool it with a baboon’s blood , Then the charm is firm and good .
Draw , you rascal . You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father . Draw , you rogue , or I’ll so carbonado your shanks . Draw , you rascal Come your ways .
Help , ho Murder Help
Strike , you slave . Stand , rogue . Stand , you neat slave , strike
Oh well done I commend your pains , And every one shall share i th gains . And now about the cauldron sing , Like elves and fairies in a ring , Enchanting all that you put in .
Help , ho Murder , murder
By the pricking of my thumbs , Something wicked this way comes . Open , locks , Whoever knocks .
How now What’s the matter Part .
With you , goodman boy , if you please . Come , I’ll flesh ye . Come on , young master .
I blame you not for praising Caesar so . But what compact mean you to have with us Will you be pricked in number of our friends Or shall we on , and not depend on you
Therefore I took your hands , but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar . Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous .
Or else were this a savage spectacle Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you , Antony , the son of Caesar , You should be satisfied .
That’s all I seek . And am moreover suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace , And in the pulpit , as becomes a friend , Speak in the order of his funeral .
You shall , Mark Antony .
Brutus , a word with you . You know not what you do . Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral . Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter
By your pardon . I will myself into the pulpit first , And show the reason of our Caesar’s death .
With all my heart .
Then , brother John of Lancaster , to you This honorable bounty shall belong . Go to the Douglas , and deliver him Up to his pleasure , ransomless and free . His valor shown upon our crests today Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds , Even in the bosom of our adversaries .
I thank your Grace for this high courtesy , Which I shall give away immediately .
Then this remains , that we divide our power . You , son John , and my cousin Westmoreland , Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop , Who , as we hear , are busily in arms . Myself and you , son Harry , will towards Wales To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March . Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway , Meeting the check of such another day . And since this business so fair is done , Let us not leave till all our own be won .
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel That the great body of our state may go In equal rank with the best governed nation That war , or peace , or both at once , may be As things acquainted and familiar to us , In which you , father , shall have foremost hand . Our coronation done , we will accite , As I before remembered , all our state . And , God consigning to my good intents , No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say God shorten Harry’s happy life one day .
Weapons , arms What’s the matter here
Keep peace , upon your lives . He dies that strikes again . What is the matter
The messengers from our sister and the king .
What is your difference Speak .
I am scarce in breath , my lord .
What Antony shall speak , I will protest , He speaks by leave and by permission , And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies . It shall advantage more than do us wrong .
No marvel , you have so bestirred your valor . You cowardly rascal , nature disclaims in thee . A tailor made thee .
Thou art a strange fellow . A tailor make a man
I know not what may fall . I like it not .
Ay , a tailor , sir . A stone cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o th trade .
Mark Antony , here , take you Caesar’s body . You shall not in your funeral speech blame us , But speak all good you can devise of Caesar , And say you do ’t by our permission . Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral . And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended .
Speak yet . How grew your quarrel
Be it so . I do desire no more .
This ancient ruffian , sir , whose life I have spared at suit of his gray beard
Prepare the body then , and follow us .
Thou whoreson zed , thou unnecessary letter My lord , if you will give me leave , I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him . Spare my gray beard , you wagtail
Peace , sirrah You beastly knave , know you no reverence
Yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege .
O , pardon me , thou bleeding piece of earth , That I am meek and gentle with these butchers Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times . Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood Over thy wounds now do I prophesy Which , like dumb mouths , do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue A curse shall light upon the limbs of men .
How now What noise is that
How now , you secret , black , and midnight hags What is ’t you do
A deed without a name .
I conjure you by that which you profess Howe er you come to know it answer me . Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches , though the yeasty waves Confound and swallow navigation up , Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down , Though castles topple on their warders heads , Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations , though the treasure Of nature’s germens tumble all together , Even till destruction sicken , answer me To what I ask you .
O heat , dry up my brains Tears seven times salt , Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye By heaven , thy madness shall be paid by weight , Till our scale turn the beam . O rose of May , Dear maid , kind sister , sweet Ophelia O heavens , is ’t possible a young maid’s wits Should be as mortal as an old man’s life Nature is fine in love , and where ’tis fine , It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves .
How now , how now , what’s the matter
Speak .
My Lord of Warwick , here is , praised be God for it , a most contagious treason come to light , look you , as you shall desire in a summer’s day .
They bore him barefaced on the bier , Hey , non nonny , nonny , hey , nonny , And in his grave rained many a tear . Fare you well , my dove .
Demand .
We’ll answer .
Here is his Majesty .
Hadst thou thy wits , and didst persuade revenge , It could not move thus .
You must sing A down a down And you , Call him a down a Oh , how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter .
How now , what’s the matter
Nay , you shall see my orchard , where , in an arbor , we will eat a last year’s pippin of my own graffing , with a dish of caraways , and so forth . Come , cousin Silence . And then to bed .
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy . Blood and destruction shall be so in use , And dreadful objects so familiar , That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war , All pity choked with custom of fell deeds , And Caesar’s spirit , ranging for revenge , With Ate by his side come hot from hell , Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war , That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men , groaning for burial .
Fore God , you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich .
You serve Octavius Caesar , do you not
Barren , barren , barren , beggars all , beggars all , Sir John . Marry , good air . Spread , Davy , spread , Davy . Well said , Davy .
I do , Mark Antony .
This Davy serves you for good uses . He is your servingman and your husband .
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome .
A good varlet , a good varlet , a very good varlet , Sir John . By the Mass , I have drunk too much sack at supper . A good varlet . Now sit down , now sit down . Come , cousin .
He did receive his letters and is coming . And bid me say to you by word of mouth O Caesar
Ah , sirrah , quoth he , we shall Do nothing but eat and make good cheer , And praise God for the merry year , When flesh is cheap and females dear , And lusty lads roam here and there So merrily , And ever among so merrily .
Thy heart is big . Get thee apart and weep . Passion , I see , is catching , for mine eyes , Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , Began to water . Is thy master coming
There’s a merry heart Good Master Silence , I’ll give you a health for that anon .
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome .
Say , if th hadst rather hear it from our mouths , Or from our masters .
Why art thou angry
My liege , here is a villain and a traitor , that , look your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alençon .
That such a slave as this should wear a sword , Who wears no honesty . Such smiling rogues as these , Like rats , oft bite the holy cords atwain Which are too intrinse t unloose , smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel , Bring oil to fire , snow to the colder moods Renege , affirm , and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters , Knowing naught , like dogs , but following . A plague upon your epileptic visage Smile you my speeches as I were a fool Goose , an I had you upon Sarum plain , I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot .
Call em . Let me see em .
This nothing’s more than matter .
Why , art thou mad , old fellow
How fell you out Say that .
No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave .
Why dost thou call him knave What’s his offense
Pour in sow’s blood , that hath eaten Her nine farrow grease that’s sweaten From the murderer’s gibbet throw Into the flame .
There’s rosemary , that’s for remembrance . Pray you , love , remember . And there is pansies , that’s for thoughts .
My liege , this was my glove here is the fellow of it . And he that I gave it to in change promised to wear it in his cap . I promised to strike him if he did . I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
His countenance likes me not .
No more perchance does mine , nor his , nor hers .
Sir , ’tis my occupation to be plain . I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant .
Your Majesty , hear now , saving your Majesty’s manhood , what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is . I hope your Majesty is pear me testimony and witness , and will avouchment that this is the glove of Alençon that your Majesty is give me , in your conscience now .
Give me thy glove , soldier . Look , here is the fellow of it . Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike , And thou hast given me most bitter terms .
Escalus .
My lord .
Of government the properties to unfold , Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse Since I am put to know that your own science Exceeds , in that , the lists of all advice My strength can give you then no more remains , But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able , And let them work . The nature of our people , Our city’s institutions , and the terms For common justice , you’re as pregnant in As art and practise hath enriched any That we remember . There is our commission , From which we would not have you warp . Call hither , I say , bid come before us Angelo .
What figure of us think you he will bear For you must know , we have with special soul Elected him our absence to supply , Lent him our terror , dress’d him with our love , And given his deputation all the organs Of our own power what think you of it
Post back with speed , and tell him what hath chanced . Here is a mourning Rome , a dangerous Rome , No Rome of safety for Octavius yet . Hie hence , and tell him so . Yet , stay awhile . Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace . There shall I try , In my oration , how the people take The cruèl issue of these bloody men . According to the which , thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things . Lend me your hand .
This is some fellow , Who , having been praised for bluntness , doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature . He cannot flatter , he . An honest mind and plain , he must speak truth . An they will take it , so . If not , he’s plain . These kind of knaves I know , which in this plainness Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends Than twenty silly ducking observants That stretch their duties nicely .
Sir , in good faith , or in sincere verity , Under th allowance of your great aspect , Whose influence , like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus front
What mean’st by this
To go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much . I know , sir , I am no flatterer . He that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave , which for my part I will not be , though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to ’t .
What was th offense you gave him
I never gave him any . It pleased the king his master very late To strike at me upon his misconstruction When he , conjunct and flattering his displeasure , Tripped me behind being down , insulted , railed , And put upon him such a deal of man That worthied him , got praises of the king For him attempting who was self subdued . And in the fleshment of this dread exploit Drew on me here again .
Give Master Bardolph some wine , Davy .
Sweet sir , sit . I’ll be with you anon . Most sweet sir , sit . Master page , good master page , sit . Proface . What you want in meat , we’ll have in drink , but you must bear . The heart’s all .
Be merry , Master Bardolph . And , my little soldier there , be merry .
Be merry , be merry , my wife has all , For women are shrews , both short and tall . Tis merry in hall when beards wag all , And welcome merry Shrovetide . Be merry , be merry .
I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle .
Who , I I have been merry twice and once ere now .
Where dwellest thou
Under the canopy .
Under the canopy
There’s a dish of leather coats for you .
Ay .
Davy
Your Worship , I’ll be with you straight . A cup of wine , sir
Where’s that
I’ the city of kites and crows .
A cup of wine that’s brisk and fine , And drink unto thee , leman mine , And a merry heart lives long a .
I’ the city of kites and crows What an ass it is Then thou dwellest with daws too
No , I serve not thy master .
How , sir do you meddle with my master
Ay ’tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress . Thou pratest , and pratest serve with thy trencher , hence
Where is this fellow
Here , sir I’ld have beaten him like a dog , but for disturbing the lords within .
Whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name Why speak’st not speak , man what’s thy name
If , Tullus ,
We will be satisfied Let us be satisfied
Then follow me and give me audience , friends . Cassius , go you into the other street And part the numbers . Those that will hear me speak , let em stay here . Those that will follow Cassius , go with him , And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death .
I will hear Brutus speak .
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd .
The noble Brutus is ascended . Silence
Be patient till the last . Romans , countrymen , and lovers Hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear . Believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe . Censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge . If there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar’s , to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his . If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
Come , high or low Thyself and office deftly show
Tell me , thou unknown power
He knows thy thought . Hear his speech but say thou nought .
Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth Beware Macduff . Beware the thane of Fife . Dismiss me . Enough .
Whate er thou art , for thy good caution , thanks . Thou hast harped my fear aright . But one word more
He will not be commanded . Here’s another More potent than the first .
Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth
Had I three ears , I’d hear thee .
If any in Vienna be of worth To undergo such ample grace and honour , It is Lord Angelo .
Be bloody , bold , and resolute . Laugh to scorn The power of man , for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth .
Look where he comes .
Descends
Always obedient to your grace’s will , I come to know your pleasure .
Angelo , There is a kind of character in thy life , That to the observer doth thy history Fully unfold . Thyself and thy belongings Are not thine own so proper as to waste Thyself upon thy virtues , they on thee . Heaven doth with us as we with torches do , Not light them for themselves for if our virtues Did not go forth of us , ’twere all alike As if we had them not . Spirits are not finely touch’d But to fine issues , nor Nature never lends The smallest scruple of her excellence But , like a thrifty goddess , she determines Herself the glory of a creditor , Both thanks and use . But I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him advertise Hold therefore , AngeloThis has several potential meanings . Either Stand firm , or Angelo could be starting to protest and Duke Vincentio could be saying , Stop , don’t interrupt me . It could also mean Here , take this , as the Duke hands Angelo his commission , or tries to . Hold therefore , Angelo In our remove be thou at full ourself Mortality and mercy in Vienna Live in thy tongue and heart old Escalus , Though first in question , is thy secondary . Take thy commission .
Well said , Master Silence .
And we shall be merry now comes in the sweet o th night .
Health and long life to you , Master Silence .
Fill the cup , and let it come , I’ll pledge you a mile to th bottom .
Honest Bardolph , welcome . If thou wantest anything and wilt not call , beshrew thy heart . Welcome , my little tiny thief , and welcome indeed too . I’ll drink to Master Bardolph , and to all the cabileros about London .
I hope to see London once ere I die .
An I might see you there , Davy
By the Mass , you’ll crack a quart together , ha , will you not , Master Bardolph
Yea , sir , in a pottle pot .
By God’s liggens , I thank thee . The knave will stick by thee , I can assure thee that . He will not out , he . Tis true bred
And I’ll stick by him , sir .
Why , there spoke a king . Lack nothing , be merry . One knocks at the door within Look who’s at door there , ho . Who knocks
A document in madness . Thoughts and remembrance fitted .
There’s fennel for you , and columbines . There’s rue for you , and here’s some for me . We may call it herb of grace o Sundays . Oh , you must wear your rue with a difference . There’s a daisy . I would give you some violets , but they withered all when my father died . They say he made a good end For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy
Thought and affliction , passion , hell itself , She turns to favor and to prettiness .
And will he not come again And will he not come again No , no , he is dead , Go to thy deathbed . He never will come again . His beard was as white as snow , All flaxen was his poll . He is gone , he is gone , And we cast away moan , God ha mercy on his soul . And of all Christian souls , I pray God . God be wi ye .
Do you see this , O God
Laertes , I must commune with your grief , Or you deny me right . Go but apart , Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will . And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me . If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touched , we will our kingdom give , Our crown , our life , and all that we can ours , To you in satisfaction . But if not , Be you content to lend your patience to us , And we shall jointly labor with your soul To give it due content .
None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool .
Fetch forth the stocks , ho You stubborn ancient knave , you reverend braggart , We’ll teach you .
Sir , I am too old to learn . Call not your stocks for me . I serve the king , On whose employment I was sent to you . You shall do small respect , show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master , Stocking his messenger .
Fetch forth the stocks As I have life and honor , there shall he sit till noon .
Till noon Till night , my lord , and all night too .
Why , madam , if I were your father’s dog , You should not use me so .
Sir , being his knave , I will .
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of . Come , bring away the stocks
Let me beseech your grace not to do so . His fault is much , and the good king his master Will check him for ’t . Your purposed low correction Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches For pilferings and most common trespasses Are punished with .
An please your Majesty , let his neck answer for it , if there is any martial law in the world .
How canst thou make me satisfaction
All offenses , my lord , come from the heart . Never came any from mine that might offend your Majesty .
It was ourself thou didst abuse .
Your Majesty came not like yourself . You appeared to me but as a common man . Witness the night , your garments , your lowliness . And what your Highness suffered under that shape , I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine , for , had you been as I took you for , I made no offense . Therefore , I beseech your Highness pardon me .
Here , uncle Exeter , fill this glove with crowns And give it to this fellow . Keep it , fellow , And wear it for an honor in thy cap Till I do challenge it . Give him the crowns . And , captain , you must needs be friends with him .
By this day and this light , the fellow has mettle enough in his belly . Hold , there is twelve pence for you , and I pray you to serve God and keep you out of prawls and prabbles and quarrels and dissensions , and I warrant you it is the better for you .
I will none of your money .
Now , good my lord , Let there be some more test made of my metal , Before so noble and so great a figure Be stamp’d upon it .
No more evasion We have with a leaven’d and prepared choice Proceeded to you therefore take your honours . Our haste from hence is of so quick condition That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion’d Matters of needful value . We shall write to you , As time and our concernings shall importune , How it goes with us , and do look to know What doth befall you here . So , fare you well To the hopeful execution do I leave you Of your commissions .
Yet give leave , my lord , That we may bring you something on the way .
My haste may not admit it Nor need you , on mine honour , have to do With any scruple your scope is as mine own So to enforce or qualify the laws As to your soul seems good . Give me your hand I’ll privily away . I love the people , But do not like to stage me to their eyes Through it do well , I do not relish well Their loud applause and Aves vehement Nor do I think the man of safe discretion That does affect it . Once more , fare you well .
What is thy name
A name unmusical to the Volscians’ ears , And harsh in sound to thine .
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves , than that Caesar were dead , to live all free men As Caesar loved me , I weep for him . As he was fortunate , I rejoice at it . As he was valiant , I honor him . But , as he was ambitious , I slew him . There is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition . Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any , speak for him have I offended . Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any , speak for him have I offended . Who is here so vile that will not love his country If any , speak for him have I offended . I pause for a reply .
Say , what’s thy name Thou hast a grim appearance , and thy face Bears a command in’t though thy tackle’s torn . Thou show’st a noble vessel what’s thy name
None , Brutus , none .
Prepare thy brow to frown know’st thou me yet
Then live , Macduff . What need I fear of thee But yet I’ll make assurance double sure , And take a bond of fate . Thou shalt not live , That I may tell pale hearted fear it lies , And sleep in spite of thunder .
I know thee not thy name
Then none have I offended . I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus . The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol . His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
What is this That rises like the issue of a king , And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I depart that , as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome , I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death .
Listen but speak not to ’t .
Live , Brutus Live , live
Be lion mettled , proud , and take no care Who chafes , who frets , or where conspirers are . Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him .
My name is Caius Martius , who hath done To thee particularly and to all the Volsces Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may My surname , Coriolanus the painful service , The extreme dangers and the drops of blood Shed for my thankless country are requited But with that surname a good memory , And witness of the malice and displeasure Which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains The cruelty and envy of the people , Permitted by our dastard nobles , who Have all forsook me , hath devour’d the rest And suffer’d me by the voice of slaves to be Whoop’d out of Rome . Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope Mistake me not to save my life , for if I had fear’d death , of all the men i’ the world I would have ’voided thee , but in mere spite , To be full quit of those my banishers , Stand I before thee here . Then if thou hast A heart of wreak in thee , that wilt revenge Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims Of shame seen through thy country , speed thee straight , And make my misery serve thy turn so use it That my revengeful services may prove As benefits to thee , for I will fight Against my canker’d country with the spleen Of all the under fiends . But if so be Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes Thou’rt tired , then , in a word , I also am Longer to live most weary , and present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice Which not to cut would show thee but a fool , Since I have ever follow’d thee with hate , Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country’s breast , And cannot live but to thy shame , unless It be to do thee service .
Bring him with triumph home unto his house
That will never be . Who can impress the forest , bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root Sweet bodements Good Rebellious dead , rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise , and our high placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature , pay his breath To time and mortal custom . Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing . Tell me , if your art Can tell so much shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom
Why , now you have done me right .
Do me right , And dub me knight , Samingo . Is ’t not so
Tis so .
Is ’t so Why then , say an old man can do somewhat .
An ’t please your Worship , there’s one Pistol come from the court with news .
From the court Let him come in .
How now , Pistol
Sir John , God save you .
What wind blew you hither , Pistol
Not the ill wind which blows no man to good . Sweet knight , thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm .
The king his master needs must take it ill , That he , so slightly valued in his messenger , Should have him thus restrained .
I’ll answer that .
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused , assaulted For following her affairs . Put in his legs .
Come , my good lord , away .
It is with a good will . I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes . Come , wherefore should you be so pashful Your shoes is not so good . Tis a good silling , I warrant you , or I will change it .
Give him a statue with his ancestors
I am sorry for thee , friend . Tis the duke’s pleasure , Whose disposition , all the world well knows , Will not be rubbed nor stopped . I’ll entreat for thee .
Let this be so . His means of death , his obscure funeral No trophy , sword , nor hatchment o er his bones , No noble rite nor formal ostentation Cry to be heard as ’twere from heaven to earth , That I must call ’t in question .
Now , herald , are the dead numbered
Let him be Caesar
So you shall . And where the offense is , let the great ax fall . I pray you , go with me .
Pray you do not , sir . I have watched and traveled hard . Some time I shall sleep out . The rest I’ll whistle . A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels . Give you good morrow .
Here is the number of the slaughtered French .
The duke’s to blame in this . Twill be ill taken .
Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus
What prisoners of good sort are taken , uncle
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
Charles , duke of Orléans , nephew to the king John , duke of Bourbon , and Lord Bouciqualt . Of other lords and barons , knights and squires , Full fifteen hundred , besides common men .
My countrymen
Peace , silence Brutus speaks .
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lie slain . Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners , there lie dead One hundred twenty six . Added to these , Of knights , esquires , and gallant gentlemen , Eight thousand and four hundred , of the which , Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights . So that in these ten thousand they have lost , There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries . The rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , And gentlemen of blood and quality . The names of those their nobles that lie dead Charles Delabreth , high constable of France Jaques of Chatillon , admiral of France The Master of the Crossbows , Lord Rambures
Peace , ho
Good countrymen , let me depart alone . And , for my sake , stay here with Antony . Do grace to Caesar’s corpse , and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories , which Mark Antony By our permission is allowed to make . I do entreat you , not a man depart , Save I alone , till Antony have spoke .
The heavens give safety to your purposes
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness
I thank you . Fare you well .
Stay , ho And let us hear Mark Antony .
Let him go up into the public chair . We’ll hear him . Noble Antony , go up .
O Martius , Martius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy . If Jupiter Should from yond cloud speak divine things , And say ‘’Tis true , ’ I’ld not believe them more Than thee , all noble Martius . Let me twine Mine arms about that body , where against My grained ash an hundred times hath broke And scarr’d the moon with splinters here I clip The anvil of my sword , and do contest As hotly and as nobly with thy love As ever in ambitious strength I did Contend against thy valour . Know thou first , I loved the maid I married never man Sigh’d truer breath but that I see thee here , Thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold . Why , thou Mars I tell thee , We have a power on foot and I had purpose Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn , Or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out Twelve several times , and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters ’twixt thyself and me We have been down together in my sleep , Unbuckling helms , fisting each other’s throat , And waked half dead with nothing . Worthy Martius , Had we no quarrel else to Rome , but that Thou art thence banish’d , we would muster all From twelve to seventy , and pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome , Like a bold flood o’er bear . O , come , go in , And take our friendly senators by the hands Who now are here , taking their leaves of me , Who am prepared against your territories , Though not for Rome itself .
For Brutus sake , I am beholding to you .
I shall desire you , sir , to give me leave To have free speech with you and it concerns me To look into the bottom of my place A power I have , but of what strength and nature I am not yet instructed .
’Tis so with me . Let us withdraw together , And we may soon our satisfaction have Touching that point .
I’ll wait upon your honour .
Good King , that must approve the common saw , Thou out of heaven’s benediction comest To the warm sun .
By r Lady , I think he be , but Goodman Puff of Barson .
Puff Puff in thy teeth , most recreant coward base Sir John , I am thy Pistol and thy friend , And helter skelter have I rode to thee , And tidings do I bring , and lucky joys , And golden times , and happy news of price .
I pray thee now , deliver them like a man of this world .
A foutre for the world and worldlings base I speak of Africa and golden joys .
O base Assyrian knight , what is thy news Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof .
And Robin Hood , Scarlet , and John .
Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons , And shall good news be baffled Then , Pistol , lay thy head in Furies lap .
Honest gentleman , I know not your breeding .
Why then , lament therefor .
Great Master of France , the brave Sir Guichard Dauphin John , duke of Alençon Anthony , duke of Brabant , The brother of the duke of Burgundy , And Edward , duke of Bar . Of lusty earls Grandpré and Roussi , Faulconbridge and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale . Here was a royal fellowship of death . Where is the number of our English dead
Edward the duke of York , the earl of Suffolk , Sir Richard Ketly , Davy Gam , esquire None else of name , and of all other men But five and twenty . O God , thy arm was here , And not to us but to thy arm alone Ascribe we all When , without stratagem , But in plain shock and even play of battle , Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th other Take it , God , For it is none but thine .
Tis wonderful .
Come , go we in procession to the village , And be it death proclaimèd through our host To boast of this or take that praise from God Which is His only .
Is it not lawful , an please your Majesty , to tell how many is killed
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement That God fought for us .
Yes , my conscience , He did us great good .
What does he say of Brutus
He says for Brutus sake He finds himself beholding to us all .
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here .
This Caesar was a tyrant .
Nay , that’s certain . We are blest that Rome is rid of him .
Peace Let us hear what Antony can say .
You gentle Romans
Peace , ho Let us hear him .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears . I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him . The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interrèd with their bones . So let it be with Caesar . The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious . If it were so , it was a grievous fault , And grievously hath Caesar answered it . Here , under leave of Brutus and the rest For Brutus is an honorable man So are they all , all honorable men Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral . He was my friend , faithful and just to me . But Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man . He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill .
You bless me , gods
Therefore , most absolute sir , if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges , take The one half of my commission and set down As best thou art experienced , since thou know’st Thy country’s strength and weakness , thine own ways Whether to knock against the gates of Rome , Or rudely visit them in parts remote , To fright them , ere destroy . But come in Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires . A thousand welcomes And more a friend than e’er an enemy Yet , Martius , that was much . Your hand most welcome
Here’s a strange alteration
By my hand , I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him .
What an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb , as one would set up a top .
Nay , I knew by his face that there was something in him he had , sir , a kind of face , methought , I cannot tell how to term it .
Seek to know no more .
I will be satisfied . Deny me this , And an eternal curse fall on you Let me know . Why sinks that cauldron And what noise is this
Show .
Show .
Show .
Show his eyes and grieve his heart . Come like shadows so depart
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo . Down Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs . And thy hair , Thou other gold bound brow , is like the first . A third is like the former . Filthy hags Why do you show me this A fourth Start , eyes What , will the line stretch out to th crack of doom Another yet A seventh I’ll see no more . And yet the eighth appears , who bears a glass Which shows me many more , and some I see That twofold balls and treble scepters carry . Horrible sight Now I see ’tis true For the blood boltered Banquo smiles upon me And points at them for his .
I heard myself proclaimed , And by the happy hollow of a tree Escaped the hunt . No port is free , no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking . Whiles I may ’scape , I will preserve myself , and am bethought To take the basest and most poorest shape That ever penury in contempt of man Brought near to beast . My face I’ll grime with filth , Blanket my loins , elf all my hair in knots , And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky . The country gives me proof and precedent Of Bedlam beggars , who with roaring voices Strike in their numbed and mortified bare arms Pins , wooden pricks , nails , sprigs of rosemary , And with this horrible object from low farms , Poor pelting villages , sheepcotes , and mills , Sometime with lunatic bans , sometime with prayers , Enforce their charity . Poor Turlygod Poor Tom That’s something yet . Edgar I nothing am .
Give me pardon , sir . If , sir , you come with news from the court , I take it there’s but two ways , either to utter them , or to conceal them . I am , sir , under the King in some authority .
Under which king , besonian Speak or die .
Under King Harry .
Harry the Fourth , or Fifth
Harry the Fourth .
A foutre for thine office Sir John , thy tender lambkin now is king . Harry the Fifth’s the man . I speak the truth . When Pistol lies , do this and fig me , like The bragging Spaniard .
What , is the old king dead
As nail in door . The things I speak are just .
Away , Bardolph . Saddle my horse . Master Robert Shallow , choose what office thou wilt in the land , ’tis thine . Pistol , I will double charge thee with dignities .
O joyful day I would not take a knighthood for my fortune .
What , I do bring good news
Carry Master Silence to bed . Master Shallow , my Lord Shallow , be what thou wilt . I am Fortune’s steward . Get on
What are they that would speak with me
Do we all holy rites . Let there be sung Non nobis and Te Deum , The dead with charity enclosed in clay , And then to Calais , and to England then , Where ne er from France arrived more happy men .
Seafaring men , sir . They say they have letters for you .
Let them come in .
I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted , if not from Lord Hamlet .
God bless you , sir .
Let him bless thee too .
He shall , sir , an ’t please Him . There’s a letter for you , sir it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England if your name be Horatio , as I am let to know it is .
Horatio , When thou shalt have overlooked this , give these fellows some means to the king . They have letters for him . Ere we were two days old at sea , a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase . Finding ourselves too slow of sail , we put on a compelled valor , and in the grapple I boarded them . On the instant , they got clear of our ship , so I alone became their prisoner . They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy , but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for them .
He had so looking as it were would I were hanged , but I thought there was more in him than I could think .
So did I , I’ll be sworn he is simply the rarest man i’ the world .
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious When that the poor have cried , Caesar hath wept . Ambition should be made of sterner stuff . Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man . You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown , Which he did thrice refuse . Was this ambition Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And , sure , he is an honorable man . I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke , But here I am to speak what I do know . You all did love him once , not without cause . What cause withholds you then to mourn for him O judgment Thou art fled to brutish beasts , And men have lost their reason . Bear with me . My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar , And I must pause till it come back to me .
I think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on .
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings .
Who , my master
If thou consider rightly of the matter , Caesar has had great wrong .
Nay , it’s no matter for that .
Has he , masters I fear there will a worse come in his place .
Worth six on him .
Marked ye his words He would not take the crown . Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious .
Nay , not so neither but I take him to be the greater soldier .
If it be found so , some will dear abide it .
Faith , look you , one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town , our general is excellent .
Poor soul His eyes are red as fire with weeping .
Ay , and for an assault too .
There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony .
O slaves , I can tell you news , news , you rascals
What , what , what let’s partake .
I would not be a Roman , of all nations I had as lieve be a condemned man .
Wherefore wherefore
Why , here’s he that was wont to thwack our general , Caius Martius .
Why do you say ‘thwack our general’
I do not say ‘thwack our general ’ but he was always good enough for him .
What , is this so
Ay , sir , all this is so . But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly Come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , And show the best of our delights . I’ll charm th air to give a sound , While you perform your antic round . That this great king may kindly say , Our duties did his welcome pay .
Where are they Gone Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursèd in the calendar Come in , without there .
What’s your grace’s will
Saw you the weird sisters
No , my lord .
Came they not by you
No , indeed , my lord .
Infected be the air whereon they ride , And damned all those that trust them I did hear The galloping of horse . Who was ’t came by
thy boots . We’ll ride all night . O sweet Pistol Away , Bardolph
Come , Pistol , utter more to me , and withal devise something to do thyself good . Boot , boot , Master Shallow . I know the young King is sick for me . Let us take any man’s horses . The laws of England are at my commandment . Blessed are they that have been my friends , and woe to my Lord Chief Justice
Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also Where is the life that late I led say they . Why , here it is . Welcome these pleasant days .
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them and of such as have , I humbly pray them to admit th excuse Of time , of numbers , and due course of things , Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented . Now we bear the king Toward Calais . Grant him there . There seen , Heave him away upon your wingèd thoughts Athwart the sea . Behold , the English beach Pales in the flood with men , with wives and boys , Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep mouthed sea , Which like a mighty whiffler fore the king Seems to prepare his way . So let him land , And solemnly see him set on to London . So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath , Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city . He forbids it , Being free from vainness and self glorious pride , Giving full trophy , signal , and ostent Quite from himself , to God . But now behold , In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought , How London doth pour out her citizens . The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort , Like to the senators of th antique Rome , With the plebeians swarming at their heels , Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in As , by a lower but loving likelihood ,
Now mark him . He begins again to speak .
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world . Now lies he there , And none so poor to do him reverence . O masters , if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I should do Brutus wrong , and Cassius wrong Who , you all know , are honorable men . I will not do them wrong . I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , Than I will wrong such honorable men . But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar . I found it in his closet . Tis his will . Let but the commons hear this testament Which , pardon me , I do not mean to read And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood , Yea , beg a hair of him for memory , And , dying , mention it within their wills , Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue .
We’ll hear the will . Read it , Mark Antony
The will , the will We will hear Caesar’s will .
Have patience , gentle friends . I must not read it . It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you . You are not wood , you are not stones , but men . And , being men , bearing the will of Caesar , It will inflame you , it will make you mad . Tis good you know not that you are his heirs . For , if you should Oh , what would come of it
If the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary , why then all the dukes fall upon the king .
Heaven grant us its peace , but not the King of Hungary’s
Amen .
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate , that went to sea with the Ten Commandments , but scraped one out of the table .
Let the king have the letters I have sent , and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death . I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb , yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter . These good fellows will bring thee where I am . Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England . Of them I have much to tell thee . Fare well . He that thou knowest thine , Hamlet . Come , I will give you way for these your letters , And do ’t the speedier , that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them .
‘Thou shalt not steal’
Ay , that he razed .
Why , ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal . There’s not a soldier of us all , that , in the thanksgiving before meat , do relish the petition well that prays for peace .
I never heard any soldier dislike it .
I believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was said .
No a dozen times at least .
What , in metre
Come , we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himself .
He was too hard for him directly , to say the troth on’t before Corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado .
An he had been cannibally given , he might have broiled and eaten him too .
But , more of thy news
Why , he is so made on here within , as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end o’ the table no question asked him by any of the senators , but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with’s hand and turns up the white o’ the eye to his discourse . But the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i’ the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half , by the entreaty and grant of the whole table . He’ll go , he says , and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him , and leave his passage polled .
And he’s as like to do’t as any man I can imagine .
Do’t he will do’t for , look you , sir , he has as many friends as enemies which friends , sir , as it were , durst not , look you , sir , show themselves , as we term it , his friends whilst he’s in directitude .
Tis strange that they should so depart from home , And not send back my messenger .
As I learned , The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove .
Tis two or three , my lord , that bring you word Macduff is fled to England .
Fled to England
Read the will . We’ll hear it , Antony . You shall read us the will , Caesar’s will .
Will you be patient Will you stay awhile I have o ershot myself to tell you of it . I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar . I do fear it .
Ay , my good lord .
Hail to thee , noble master
Ha Makest thou this shame thy pastime
No , my lord .
They were traitors Honorable men
Ha , ha Look , he wears cruel garters . Horses are tied by the heads , dogs and bears by the neck , monkeys by the loins , and men by the legs . When a man’s overlusty at legs , then he wears wooden nether stocks .
Time , thou anticipat’st my dread exploits . The flighty purpose never is o ertook Unless the deed go with it . From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand . And even now , To crown my thoughts with acts , be it thought and done The castle of Macduff I will surprise , Seize upon Fife , give to th edge o th sword His wife , his babes , and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line . No boasting like a fool . This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool . But no more sights Where are these gentlemen Come , bring me where they are .
What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here
It is both he and she Your son and daughter .
No .
The will The testament
Were now the general of our gracious empress , As in good time he may , from Ireland coming , Bringing rebellion broached on his sword , How many would the peaceful city quit To welcome him Much more , and much more cause , Did they this Harry . Now in London place him and omit All the occurrences , whatever chanced , Till Harry’s back return again to France . There must we bring him , and myself have played The interim , by remembering you ’tis past . Then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance After your thoughts , straight back again to France .
No , thou arrant knave . I would to God that I might die , that I might have thee hanged . Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of joint .
The Constables have delivered her over to me , and she shall have whipping cheer enough , I warrant her . There hath been a man or two lately killed about her .
Nut hook , nut hook , you lie Come on , I ’ll tell thee what , thou damned tripe visaged rascal an the child I now go with do miscarry , thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother , thou paper faced villain .
O the Lord , that Sir John were come I would make this a bloody day to somebody . But I pray God the fruit of her womb might miscarry .
If it do , you shall have a dozen of cushions again you have but eleven now . Come , I charge you both go with me , for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you .
I’ll tell you what , you thin man in a censer , I will have you as soundly swinged for this , you bluebottle rogue , you filthy famished correctioner . If you be not swinged , I’ll forswear half kirtles .
Come , come , you she knight errant , come .
Yes .
No , I say .
I say Yea .
Directitude what’s that
They were villains , murderers . The will Read the will
You will compel me , then , to read the will Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar , And let me show you him that made the will . Shall I descend And will you give me leave
But when they shall see , sir , his crest up again , and the man in blood , they will out of their burrows , like conies after rain , and revel all with him .
Come down .
In any proportion or in any language .
But when goes this forward
Descend .
I think , or in any religion .
To morrow to day presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon ’tis , as it were , a parcel of their feast , and to be executed ere they wipe their lips .
You shall have leave .
Ay , why not Grace is grace , despite of all controversy as , for example , thou thyself art a wicked villain , despite of all grace .
Why , then we shall have a stirring world again . This peace is nothing , but to rust iron , increase tailors , and breed ballad makers .
Well , there went but a pair of shears between us .
A ring Stand round .
I grant as there may between the lists and the velvet . Thou art the list .
Let me have war , say I it exceeds peace as far as day does night it’s spritely , waking , audible , and full of vent . Peace is a very apoplexy , lethargy mulled , deaf , sleepy , insensible a getter of more bastard children than war’s a destroyer of men .
And thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou’rt a three piled piece , I warrant thee I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled , as thou art piled , for a French velvet . Do I speak feelingly now
’Tis so and as war , in some sort , may be said to be a ravisher , so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds .
Ay , and it makes men hate one another .
I think thou dost and , indeed , with most painful feeling of thy speech I will , out of thine own confession , learn to begin thy health but , whilst I live , forget to drink after thee .
I think I have done myself wrong , have I not
Reason because they then less need one another . The wars for my money . I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians . They are rising , they are rising . ALL In , in , in , in
Yes , that thou hast , whether thou art tainted or free .
Behold , behold , where Madam Mitigation comes I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to
To what , I pray
Judge .
Stand from the hearse . Stand from the body .
Room for Antony , most noble Antony
What had he done to make him fly the land
You must have patience , madam .
He had none . His flight was madness . When our actions do not , Our fears do make us traitors .
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
Wisdom To leave his wife , to leave his babes , His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly He loves us not He wants the natural touch . For the poor wren , The most diminutive of birds , will fight , Her young ones in her nest , against the owl . All is the fear and nothing is the love , As little is the wisdom , where the flight So runs against all reason .
My dearest coz , I pray you school yourself . But for your husband , He is noble , wise , judicious , and best knows The fits o th season . I dare not speak much further But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor From what we fear , yet know not what we fear , But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and none . I take my leave of you . Shall not be long but I’ll be here again . Things at the worst will cease , or else climb upward To what they were before . My pretty cousin , Blessing upon you .
Nay , that’s right . But why wear you your leek today Saint Davy’s day is past .
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things . I will tell you as my friend , Captain Gower . The rascally , scald , beggarly , lousy , pragging knave , Pistol , which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow , look you now , of no merits , he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday , look you , and bid me eat my leek . It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him , but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again , and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires .
Why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey cock .
Tis no matter for his swellings , nor his turkey cocks . God pless you , Aunchient Pistol , you scurvy , lousy knave , God pless you .
Ha , art thou bedlam Dost thou thirst , base Trojan , to have me fold up Parca’s fatal web Hence . I am qualmish at the smell of leek .
I peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to eat , look you , this leek . Because , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it , I would desire you to eat it .
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal , And you must put me in your heart for friend , Sith you have heard , and with a knowing ear , That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life .
It well appears . But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats , So criminal and so capital in nature , As by your safety , wisdom , all things else , You mainly were stirred up .
Oh , for two special reasons , Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed , But yet to me they are strong . The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks , and for myself My virtue or my plague , be it either which She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul , That , as the star moves not but in his sphere , I could not but by her . The other motive Why to a public count I might not go , Is the great love the general gender bear him , Who , dipping all his faults in their affection , Would , like the spring that turneth wood to stone , Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows , Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind , Would have reverted to my bow again , And not where I had aimed them .
To three thousand dolours dolours A pun , meaning both the French word for sadnesses and dollars . dolours a year .
Ay , and more .
A French crownA pun . A French crown is both a coin and a reference to a bald head , which often resulted from treatment for syphilis . A French crown more .
Thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error I am sound .
Nay , not as one would say , healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee .
How now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica
Well , well there’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all .
Who’s that , I pray thee
O God , that right should thus overcome might Well , of sufferance comes ease .
Marry , sir , that’s Claudio , Signior Claudio .
Come , you rogue , come , bring me to a justice .
Claudio to prison ’tis not so .
Ay , come , you starved bloodhound .
Nay , but I know ’tis so I saw him arrested , saw him carried away and , which is more , within these three days his head to be chopped off .
Goodman Death , Goodman Bones
But , after all this fooling , I would not have it so . Art thou sure of this
I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child .
Thou atomy , thou
Believe me , this may be he promised to meet me two hours since , and he was ever precise in promise keeping .
Come , you thin thing , come , you rascal .
Very well .
Fathered he is , and yet he’s fatherless .
I am so much a fool , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort . I take my leave at once .
Sirrah , your father’s dead . And what will you do now How will you live
As birds do , Mother .
What , with worms and flies
With what I get , I mean , and so do they .
Poor bird Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime , The pitfall nor the gin .
Why should I , mother Poor birds they are not set for . My father is not dead , for all your saying .
Yes , he is dead . How wilt thou do for a father
Nay , how will you do for a husband
Why , I can buy me twenty at any market .
We hear not of him , neither need we fear him His remedies are tame i’ the present peace And quietness of the people , which before Were in wild hurry . Here do we make his friends Blush that the world goes well , who rather had , Though they themselves did suffer by’t , behold Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see Our tradesmen with in their shops and going About their functions friendly .
We stood to’t in good time .
Then you’ll buy em to sell again .
Is this Menenius
Thou speak’st with all thy wit and yet , i faith , With wit enough for thee .
Was my father a traitor , Mother
Ay , that he was .
What is a traitor
Why , one that swears and lies .
And be all traitors that do so
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
Every one .
Who must hang them
Why , the honest men .
Then the liars and swearers are fools , for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them .
Now , God help thee , poor monkey But how wilt thou do for a father
If he were dead , you’d weep for him . If you would not , it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father .
Poor prattler , how thou talk’st
’Tis he , ’tis he O , he is grown most kind of late .
Hail sir
Hail to you both
Your Coriolanus Is not much miss’d , but with his friends The commonwealth doth stand , and so would do , Were he more angry at it .
All’s well and might have been much better , if He could have temporized .
No , no , they would not .
Yes , they have .
By Jupiter , I swear No .
By Juno , I swear Ay .
They durst not do ’t . They could not , would not do ’t . Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage . Resolve me with all modest haste which way Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage , Coming from us .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
There is one goat for you . Will you be so good , scald knave , as eat it
Nay , press not so upon me . Stand far off .
Base Trojan , thou shalt die .
Stand back . Room Bear back .
You say very true , scald knave , when God’s will is . I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals . Come , there is sauce for it . You called me yesterday mountain squire , but I will make you today a squire of low degree . I pray you , fall to . If you can mock a leek , you can eat a leek .
Enough , Captain . You have astonished him .
I say I will make him eat some part of my leek , or I will peat his pate four days . Bite , I pray you . It is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now . You all do know this mantle . I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on . Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent , That day he overcame the Nervii . Look , in this place ran Cassius dagger through . See what a rent the envious Casca made . Through this the well belovèd Brutus stabbed . And as he plucked his cursèd steel away , Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it , As rushing out of doors , to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked , or no . For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar’s angel . Judge , O you gods , how dearly Caesar loved him This was the most unkindest cut of all . For when the noble Caesar saw him stab , Ingratitude , more strong than traitors arms , Quite vanquished him . Then burst his mighty heart , And , in his mantle muffling up his face , Even at the base of Pompey’s statue , Which all the while ran blood , great Caesar fell . O , what a fall was there , my countrymen Then I , and you , and all of us fell down , Whilst bloody treason flourished over us . Oh , now you weep , and , I perceive , you feel The dint of pity . These are gracious drops . Kind souls , what , weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded Look you here , Here is himself , marred , as you see , with traitors .
Must I bite
Yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .
By this leek , I will most horribly revenge . I eat and eat , I swear
Eat , I pray you . Will you have some more sauce to your leek There is not enough leek to swear by .
Quiet thy cudgel . Thou dost see I eat .
My lord , when at their home I did commend your highness letters to them . Ere I was risen from the place that showed My duty kneeling , came there a reeking post , Stewed in his haste , half breathless , panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations , Delivered letters spite of intermission , Which presently they read , on whose contents They summoned up their meiny , straight took horse , Commanded me to follow and attend The leisure of their answer , gave me cold looks . And meeting here the other messenger , Whose welcome I perceived had poisoned mine Being the very fellow which of late Displayed so saucily against your highness Having more man than wit about me , drew . He raised the house with loud and coward cries . Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers .
Where is he , hear you
Bless you , fair dame I am not to you known , Though in your state of honor I am perfect . I doubt some danger does approach you nearly . If you will take a homely man’s advice , Be not found here . Hence with your little ones . To fright you thus methinks I am too savage To do worse to you were fell cruelty , Which is too nigh your person . Heaven preserve you I dare abide no longer .
Nay , I hear nothing his mother and his wife Hear nothing from him .
The gods preserve you both
Whither should I fly I have done no harm . But I remember now I am in this earthly world , where to do harm Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . Why then , alas , Do I put up that womanly defense , To say I have done no harm
God den , our neighbours .
God den to you all , god den to you all .
What are these faces
Ourselves , our wives , and children , on our knees , Are bound to pray for you both .
Where is your husband
Live , and thrive
I hope , in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him .
Farewell , kind neighbours we wish’d Coriolanus Had loved you as we did .
He’s a traitor .
Now the gods keep you
Thou liest , thou shag haired villain
Farewell , farewell .
This is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets , Crying confusion .
Caius Martius was A worthy officer i’ the war but insolent , O’ercome with pride , ambitious past all thinking , Self loving ,
And affecting one sole throne , Without assistance .
More rushes , more rushes .
The trumpets have sounded twice .
Twill be two o clock ere they come from the coronation . Dispatch , dispatch .
Stand here by me , Master Robert Shallow . I will make the King do you grace . I will leer upon him as he comes by , and do but mark the countenance that he will give me .
God bless thy lungs , good knight
Come here , Pistol , stand behind me . O , if I had had time to have made new liveries , I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you . But ’tis no matter . This poor show doth better . This doth infer the zeal I had to see him .
It doth so .
It shows my earnestness of affection
It doth so .
Besides , you know , it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose .
But , most of all , agreeing with the proclamation .
Much good do you , scald knave , heartily . Nay , pray you throw none away . The skin is good for your broken coxcomb . When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter , I pray you , mock at em , that is all .
Away let’s go learn the truth of it .
Good .
Ay , leeks is good . Hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
Thus , what with the war , what with the sweat the sweat could mean the plague of sweating sickness , or it could refer to the sweating tub , a kind of hot tub treatment for STDs . the sweat , what with the gallows and what with poverty , I am custom shrunk .
Me , a groat
How now what’s the news with you
Yes , verily , and in truth you shall take it , or I have another leek in my pocket , which you shall eat .
Yonder man is carried to prison .
I take thy groat in earnest of revenge .
Well what has he done
If I owe you anything , I will pay you in cudgels . You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels . God be wi you and keep you and heal your pate .
A woman .
All hell shall stir for this .
But what’s his offence
Go , go . You are a counterfeit cowardly knave . Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor , and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice . You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel . You find it otherwise , and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition . Fare you well .
My devotion
What , you egg Young fry of treachery
He has killed me , mother . Run away , I pray you
O piteous spectacle
O noble Caesar
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river .
What , is there a maid with child by him
No , but there’s a woman with maid by him . You have not heard of the proclamation , have you
What proclamation , man
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down .
And what shall become of those in the city
They shall stand for seed they had gone down too , but that a wise burgher put in for them .
And so have I a noble father lost , A sister driven into desperate terms , Whose worth , if praises may go back again , Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections . But my revenge will come .
Break not your sleeps for that . You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime . You shortly shall hear more . I loved your father , and we love ourself . And that , I hope , will teach you to imagine
How now , what news
Letters , my lord , from Hamlet . This to your majesty , this to the queen .
From Hamlet Who brought them
Sailors , my lord , they say . I saw them not . They were given me by Claudio . He received them Of him that brought them .
Laertes , you shall hear them . Leave us .
High and mighty , You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom . Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes , when I shall , first asking your pardon thereunto , recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return . Hamlet .
I think not so .
O woeful day
O traitors , villains
O most bloody sight
We will be revenged .
Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill Slay Let not a traitor live
Stay , countrymen .
Peace there Hear the noble Antony .
We’ll hear him . We’ll follow him . We’ll die with him .
Good friends , sweet friends Let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny . They that have done this deed are honorable . What private griefs they have , alas , I know not , That made them do it . They are wise and honorable , And will , no doubt , with reasons answer you . I come not , friends , to steal away your hearts . I am no orator , as Brutus is , But , as you know me all , a plain blunt man That love my friend . And that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him . For I have neither wit nor words nor worth , Action nor utterance nor the power of speech , To stir men’s blood . I only speak right on . I tell you that which you yourselves do know , Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds , poor poor dumb mouths , And bid them speak for me . But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny .
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now News have I that my Nell is dead i th spital Of a malady of France , And there my rendezvous is quite cut off . Old I do wax , and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled . Well , bawd I’ll turn , And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand . To England will I steal , and there I’ll steal . And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars , And swear I got them in the Gallia wars .
It doth , it doth , it doth .
As it were , to ride day and night , and not to deliberate , not to remember , not to have patience to shift me
It is best , certain .
But to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him , thinking of nothing else , putting all affairs else in oblivion , as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him .
Tis semper idem , for obsque hoc nihil est ’tis all in every part .
Tis so indeed .
My knight , I will inflame thy noble liver , and make thee rage . Thy Doll and Helen of thy noble thoughts is in base durance and contagious prison , Haled thither by most mechanical and dirty hand . Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto’s snake , for Doll is in . Pistol speaks nought but truth .
I will deliver her .
There roared the sea , and trumpet clangor sounds .
We should by this , to all our lamentation , If he had gone forth consul , found it so .
The gods have well prevented it , and Rome Sits safe and still without him .
Worthy tribunes , There is a slave , whom we have put in prison , Reports , the Volsces with two several powers Are enter’d in the Roman territories , And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before ’em .
’Tis Aufidius , Who , hearing of our Martius’ banishment , Thrusts forth his horns again into the world Which were inshell’d when Martius stood for Rome , And durst not once peep out .
Come , what talk you Of Martius
Go see this rumourer whipp’d . It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us .
Cannot be We have record that very well it can , And three examples of the like have been Within my age . But reason with the fellow , Before you punish him , where he heard this , Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreaded .
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down
To the ground , mistress .
Why , here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth What shall become of me
Come fear you not good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place , you need not change your trade I’ll be your tapsterA tapster was a bartender . tapster still . Courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service , you will be considered .
What’s to do here , Thomas Tapster Let’s withdraw .
Here comes Signior Claudio , led by the provost to prison and there’s Madam Juliet .
Fellow , why dost thou show me thus to the world Bear me to prison , where I am committed .
I do it not in evil disposition , But from Lord Angelo by special charge .

Winter’s not gone yet , if the wild geese fly that way . Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind . But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind . Fortune , that arrant whore , Ne er turns the key to th poor . But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .
O , how this mother swells up toward my heart Hysterica passio , down , thou climbing sorrow . Thy element’s below . Where is this daughter
With the earl , sir , here within .
Follow me not . Stay here .
Made you no more offense but what you speak of
None . How chance the king comes with so small a train
An thou hadst been set i th stocks for that question , thou’dst well deserved it .
Why , Fool
We’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no laboring i th winter . All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men , and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking . Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill , lest it break thy neck with following it .
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty .
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and , like good men , Bestride our downfall n birthdom . Each new morn New widows howl , new orphans cry , new sorrows Strike heaven on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor .
What should this mean Are all the rest come back Or is it some abuse , and no such thing
We’ll mutiny .
We’ll burn the house of Brutus .
Away , then Come , seek the conspirators .
Yet hear me , countrymen . Yet hear me speak .
Peace , ho Hear Antony . Most noble Antony
Why , friends , you go to do you know not what . Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves Alas , you know not . I must tell you then . You have forgot the will I told you of .
Most true . The will Let’s stay and hear the will .
Here is the will , and under Caesar’s seal To every Roman citizen he gives To every several man seventy five drachmas .
Most noble Caesar We’ll revenge his death .
O royal Caesar
Hear me with patience .
Unto our brother France and to our sister , Health and fair time of day . Joy and good wishes To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine . And , as a branch and member of this royalty , By whom this great assembly is contrived , We do salute you , Duke of Burgundy . And princes French , and peers , health to you all . Peace to this meeting wherefore we are met .
Right joyous are we to behold your face , Most worthy brother England . Fairly met . So are you , princes English , every one .
So happy be the issue , brother England , Of this good day and of this gracious meeting , As we are now glad to behold your eyes Your eyes which hitherto have borne in them Against the French that met them in their bent The fatal balls of murdering basilisks . The venom of such looks , we fairly hope , Have lost their quality , and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .
To cry Amen to that , thus we appear .
You English princes all , I do salute you .
Know you the hand
What I believe I’ll wail What know believe , and what I can redress , As I shall find the time to friend , I will . What you have spoke , it may be so perchance . This tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest . You have loved him well . He hath not touched you yet . I am young , but something You may deserve of him through me , and wisdom To offer up a weak , poor , innocent lamb T appease an angry god .
Tis Hamlet’s character . Naked And in a postscript here , he says alone . Can you advise me
I am not treacherous .
I’m lost in it , my lord . But let him come . It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth , Thus diddest thou .
God save thy Grace , King Hal , my royal Hal .
Why , how now , Claudio Whence comes this restraint
But Macbeth is . A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge . But I shall crave your pardon . That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose . Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell . Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , Yet grace must still look so .
The heavens thee guard and keep , most royal imp of fame
If it be so , Laertes As how should it be so How otherwise Will you be ruled by me
From too much liberty , my Lucio , liberty As surfeit is the father of much fast , So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint . Our natures do pursue , Like rats that ravin down their proper bane , A thirsty evil and when we drink we die .
God save thee , my sweet boy
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest , I would send for certain of my creditors and yet , to say the truth , I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment . What’s thy offence , Claudio
My Lord Chief Justice , speak to that vain man .
Ay , my lord So you will not o errule me to a peace .
What but to speak of would offend again .
Have you your wits Know you what ’tis to speak
To thine own peace . If he be now returned , As checking at his voyage , and that he means No more to undertake it , I will work him To an exploit , now ripe in my devise , Under the which he shall not choose but fall . And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe , But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident .
My lord , I will be ruled The rather if you could devise it so That I might be the organ .
What , is’t murder
No .
Lechery
Call it so .
Away , sir , you must go .
One word , good friend . Lucio , a word with you .
A hundred , if they’ll do you any good . Is lechery so look’d after
Thus stands it with me upon a true contract I got possession of Julietta’s bed You know the lady she is fast my wife , Save that we do the denunciation lack Of outward order this we came not to , Only for propagation of a dower Remaining in the coffer of her friends , From whom we thought it meet to hide our love Till time had made them for us . But it chances The stealth of our most mutual entertainment With character too gross is writ on Juliet .
My King , my Jove , I speak to thee , my heart
But the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after . When a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again . I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it . That sir which serves and seeks for gain , And follows but for form , Will pack when it begins to rain And leave thee in the storm . But I will tarry . The fool will stay . And let the wise man fly . The knave turns fool that runs away The fool , no knave , perdie .
I know thee not , old man . Fall to thy prayers . How ill white hairs become a fool and jester . I have long dreamt of such a kind of man , So surfeit swelled , so old , and so profane But being awaked , I do despise my dream . Make less thy body hence , and more thy grace Leave gormandizing . Know the grave doth gape For thee thrice wider than for other men . Reply not to me with a fool born jest . Presume not that I am the thing I was , For God doth know so shall the world perceive That I have turned away my former self . So will I those that kept me company . When thou dost hear I am as I have been , Approach me , and thou shalt be as thou wast , The tutor and the feeder of my riots . Till then I banish thee , on pain of death , As I have done the rest of my misleaders ,
Where learned you this , Fool
Not i th stocks , fool .
Deny to speak with me They are sick They are weary They have traveled all the night mere fetches , ay The images of revolt and flying off . Fetch me a better answer .
My dear lord , You know the fiery quality of the duke , How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course .
Vengeance , plague , death , confusion Fiery What quality Why , Gloucester , Gloucester , I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
Well , my good lord , I have informed them so .
Tell not me I know this cannot be .
Not possible .
My duty to you both , on equal love , Great kings of France and England . That I have labored With all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavors , To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview , Your mightiness on both parts best can witness . Since , then , my office hath so far prevailed That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted . Let it not disgrace me If I demand before this royal view What rub or what impediment there is Why that the naked , poor , and mangled peace , Dear nurse of arts , plenties , and joyful births , Should not in this best garden of the world , Our fertile France , put up her lovely visage Alas , she hath from France too long been chased , And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , Corrupting in its own fertility . Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , Unprunèd , dies . Her hedges , even pleached , Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , Put forth disordered twigs . Her fallow leas The darnel , hemlock , and rank fumitory Doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery . The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , Wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , Conceives by idleness , and nothing teems But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , Losing both beauty and utility . And as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges , Defective in their natures , grow to wildness , Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost , or do not learn for want of time , The sciences that should become our country , But grow like savages , as soldiers will
The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the senate house some news is come That turns their countenances .
’Tis this slave Go whip him , ’fore the people’s eyes his raising Nothing but his report .
Yes , worthy sir , The slave’s report is seconded and more , More fearful , is deliver’d .
What more fearful
It is spoke freely out of many mouths How probable I do not know that Martius , Join’d with Aufidius , leads a power ’gainst Rome , And vows revenge as spacious as between The young’st and oldest thing .
This is most likely
Raised only , that the weaker sort may wish Good Martius home again .
The very trick on’t .
Peace , ho
Moreover , he hath left you all his walks , His private arbors and new planted orchards , On this side Tiber . He hath left them you And to your heirs forever common pleasures , To walk abroad and recreate yourselves . Here was a Caesar When comes such another
Never , never . Come , away , away We’ll burn his body in the holy place , And with the brands fire the traitors houses . Take up the body .
Go fetch fire .
Pluck down benches .
Pluck down forms , windows , anything .
Now let it work . Mischief , thou art afoot . Take thou what course thou wilt
How now , fellow
Sir , Octavius is already come to Rome .
I have lost my hopes .
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house .
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts . Why in that rawness left you wife and child , Those precious motives , those strong knots of love , Without leave taking I pray you , Let not my jealousies be your dishonors , But mine own safeties . You may be rightly just , Whatever I shall think .
Bleed , bleed , poor country Great tyranny , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodness dare not check thee . Wear thou thy wrongs The title is affeered . Fare thee well , lord . I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp , And the rich East to boot .
Be not offended . I speak not as in absolute fear of you . I think our country sinks beneath the yoke . It weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds . I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands . But , for all this , When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head , Or wear it on my sword , yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before , More suffer , and more sundry ways than ever , By him that shall succeed .
What should he be
It falls right . You have been talked of since your travel much And that in Hamlet’s hearing for a quality Wherein , they say , you shine . Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one , and that , in my regard , Of the unworthiest siege .
What part is that , my lord
A very ribbon in the cap of youth , Yet needful too , for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds , Importing health and graveness . Two months since , Here was a gentleman of Normandy . I’ve seen myself , and served against , the French , And they can well on horseback . But this gallant Had witchcraft in ’t . He grew unto his seat , And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As he had been encorpsed and demi natured With the brave beast . So far he topped my thought , That I , in forgery of shapes and tricks , Come short of what he did .
A Norman was ’t
A Norman .
Upon my life , Lamond
The very same .
I know him well . He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation .
Informed them Dost thou understand me , man
Ay , my good lord .
The king would speak with Cornwall . The dear father Would with his daughter speak , commands , tends service . Are they informed of this My breath and blood Fiery The fiery duke Tell the hot duke that Lear No , but not yet . Maybe he is not well . Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound . We are not ourselves When nature , being oppressed , commands the mind To suffer with the body . I’ll forbear , And am fallen out with my more headier will To take the indisposed and sickly fit For the sound man . Death on my state Wherefore Should he sit here This act persuades me That this remotion of the duke and her Is practice only . Give me my servant forth . Go tell the duke and ’s wife I’d speak with them Now , presently . Bid them come forth and hear me , Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death .
I would have all well betwixt you .
O me , my heart , my rising heart But down .
And thither will I straight to visit him . He comes upon a wish . Fortune is merry , And in this mood will give us anything .
I heard him say , Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome .
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them . Bring me to Octavius .
That nothing do but meditate on blood , To swearing and stern looks , diffused attire , And everything that seems unnatural . Which to reduce into our former favor You are assembled , and my speech entreats That I may know the let why gentle peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities .
This is unlikely He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violentest contrariety .
If , Duke of Burgundy , you would the peace , Whose want gives growth to th imperfections Which you have cited , you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands , Whose tenors and particular effects You have , enscheduled briefly , in your hands .
The king hath heard them , to the which as yet There is no answer made .
You are sent for to the senate A fearful army , led by Caius Martius Associated with Aufidius , rages Upon our territories and have already O’erborne their way , consumed with fire , and took What lay before them .
Well then , the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer .
O , you have made good work
I have but with a cursitory eye O erglanced the articles . Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them , we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer .
What news what news
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and To melt the city leads upon your pates , To see your wives dishonour’d to your noses ,
Brother , we shall . Go , uncle Exeter , And brother Clarence , and you , brother Gloucester , Warwick and Huntingdon , go with the king And take with you free power to ratify , Augment , or alter , as your wisdoms best Shall see advantageable for our dignity , Anything in or out of our demands ,
What’s the news what’s the news
Your temples burned in their cement , and Your franchises , whereon you stood , confined Into an auger’s bore .
Pray now , your news You have made fair work , I fear me . Pray , your news If Martius should be join’d with Volscians ,
With child , perhaps
Unhappily , even so . And the new deputy now for the duke Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness , Or whether that the body public be A horse whereon the governor doth ride , Who , newly in the seat , that it may know He can command , lets it straight feel the spur Whether the tyranny be in his place , Or in his emmence that fills it up , I stagger in but this new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties Which have , like unscour’d armour , hung by the wall So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round And none of them been worn and , for a name , Now puts the drowsy and neglected act Freshly on me ’tis surely for a name .
I warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid , if she be in love , may sigh it off . Send after the duke and appeal to him .
I have done so , but he’s not to be found . I prithee , Lucio , do me this kind service This day my sister should the cloister enter And there receive her approbation Acquaint her with the danger of my state Implore her , in my voice , that she make friends To the strict deputy bid herself assay him I have great hope in that for in her youth There is a prone and speechless dialect , Such as move men beside , she hath prosperous art When she will play with reason and discourse , And well she can persuade .
Cry to it , nuncle , as the cockney did to the eels when she put em i th paste alive . She knapped em o th coxcombs with a stick and cried , Down , wantons , down Twas her brother that , in pure kindness to his horse , buttered his hay .
Good morrow to you both .
Hail to your grace .
I am glad to see your highness .
Regan , I think you are . I know what reason I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad , I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb , Sepulchring an adultress . Oh , are you free Some other time for that .
Belovèd Regan , Thy sister’s naught . O Regan , she hath tied Sharp toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here . I can scarce speak to thee . Thou lt not believe With how depraved a quality O Regan
He made confession of you , And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defense , And for your rapier most especially , That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed If one could match you . The ’scrimers of their nation , He swore , had had neither motion , guard , nor eye , If you opposed them . Sir , this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o er , to play with him . Now , out of this
What out of this , my lord
Not to come near our person by ten mile . For competence of life I will allow you , That lack of means enforce you not to evils . And , as we hear you do reform yourselves , We will , according to your strengths and qualities , Give you advancement . Be it your charge , my lord , To see performed the tenor of my word . Set on .
Laertes , was your father dear to you Or are you like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart
Master Shallow , I owe you a thousand pound .
Why ask you this
Yea , marry , Sir John , which I beseech you to let me have home with me .
That can hardly be , Master Shallow . Do not you grieve at this . I shall be sent for in private to him . Look you , he must seem thus to the world . Fear not your advancements . I will be the man yet that shall make you great .
Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time , And that I see , in passages of proof , Time qualifies the spark and fire of it . There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it . And nothing is at a like goodness still . For goodness , growing to a pleurisy , Dies in his own too much . That we would do , We should do when we would , for this would changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues , are hands , are accidents . And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing . But to the quick of th ulcer Hamlet comes back . What would you undertake To show yourself in deed your father’s son More than in words
I cannot well perceive how , unless you should give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw . I beseech you , good Sir John , let me have five hundred of my thousand .
Sir , I will be as good as my word . This that you heard was but a color .
A color that I fear you will die in , Sir John .
Fear no colors . Go with me to dinner . Come , Lieutenant Pistol . Come , Bardolph . I shall be sent for soon at night .
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar , And things unlucky charge my fantasy . I have no will to wander forth of doors , Yet something leads me forth .
What is your name
Whither are you going
Where do you dwell
Are you a married man or a bachelor
Answer every man directly .
Ay , and briefly .
Ay , and wisely .
Ay , and truly , you were best .
What is my name Whither am I going Where do I dwell Am I a married man or a bachelor Then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry . You’ll bear me a bang for that , I fear . Proceed , directly .
Directly , I am going to Caesar’s funeral .
If He is their god he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than nature , That shapes man better and they follow him , Against us brats , with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies , Or butchers killing flies .
You have made good work , You and your apron men you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic eaters
He will shake Your Rome about your ears .
As Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit . You have made fair work
But is this true , sir
Ay and you’ll look pale Before you find it other . All the regions Do smilingly revolt and who resist Are mock’d for valiant ignorance , And perish constant fools . Who is’t can blame him Your enemies and his find something in him .
I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like , which else would stand under grievous imposition , as for the enjoying of thy life , who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tackA board game in which pegs are inserted into holes so , a game with a sexual connotation . game of tick tack . I’ll to her .
I thank you , good friend Lucio .
Within two hours .
Come , officer , away
I pray you , sir , take patience . I have hope You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty .
Say , how is that
I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation . If , sir , perchance She have restrained the riots of your followers , Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end As clears her from all blame .
My curses on her
O sir , you are old . Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine . You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself . Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return . Say you have wronged her , sir .
Ask her forgiveness Do you but mark how this becomes the house Dear daughter , I confess that I am old . Age is unnecessary . On my knees I beg That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment , bed , and food .
Good sir , no more . These are unsightly tricks . Return you to my sister .
To cut his throat i th church .
As a friend or an enemy
No place , indeed , should murder sanctuarize . Revenge should have no bounds . But , good Laertes , Will you do this , keep close within your chamber . Hamlet returned shall know you are come home . We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you , bring you in fine together And wager on your heads . He , being remiss , Most generous and free from all contriving , Will not peruse the foils so that , with ease , Or with a little shuffling , you may choose A sword unbated , and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father .
As a friend .
That matter is answered directly .
I will do ’t . And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword . I bought an unction of a mountebank , So mortal that , but dip a knife in it , Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare , Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon , can save the thing from death That is but scratched withal . I’ll touch my point With this contagion , that if I gall him slightly It may be death .
For your dwelling briefly .
Let’s further think of this , Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape . If this should fail , And that our drift look through our bad performance , Twere better not assayed . Therefore this project
Briefly , I dwell by the Capitol .
Your name , sir , truly .
Truly , my name is Cinna .
Tear him to pieces . He’s a conspirator .
I am Cinna the poet . I am Cinna the poet .
Tear him for his bad verses Tear him for his bad verses
I am not Cinna the conspirator .
It is no matter . His name’s Cinna . Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going .
Tear him , tear him
Come , brands , ho , firebrands . To Brutus , to Cassius , burn all . Some to Decius house and some to Casca’s . Some to Ligarius . Away , go
It is myself I mean , in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That , when they shall be opened , black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow , and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb , being compared With my confineless harms .
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth .
I grant him bloody , Luxurious , avaricious , false , deceitful , Sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin That has a name . But there’s no bottom , none , In my voluptuousness . Your wives , your daughters , Your matrons , and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust , and my desire All continent impediments would o erbear That did oppose my will . Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign .
No , holy father throw away that thought Believe not that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a complete bosom . Why I desire thee To give me secret harbour , hath a purpose More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends Of burning youth .
And we’ll consign thereto . Will you , fair sister , Go with the princes or stay here with us
May your grace speak of it
Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny . It hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings . But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours . You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink . We have willing dames enough . There cannot be That vulture in you to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves , Finding it so inclined .
Our gracious brother , I will go with them . Haply a woman’s voice may do some good , When articles too nicely urged be stood on .
My holy sir , none better knows than you How I have ever loved the life removed And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth , and cost , and witless bravery keeps . I have deliver’d to Lord Angelo , A man of stricture and firm abstinence , My absolute power and place here in Vienna , And he supposes me travell’d to Poland For so I have strew’d it in the common ear , And so it is received . Now , pious sir , You will demand of me why I do this
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us . She is our capital demand , comprised Within the forerank of our articles .
Gladly , my lord .
She hath good leave .
We have strict statutes and most biting laws . The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds , Which for this nineteen years we have let slip Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave , That goes not out to prey . Now , as fond fathers , Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch , Only to stick it in their children’s sight For terror , not to use , in time the rod Becomes more mock’d than fear’d so our decrees , Dead to infliction , to themselves are dead And liberty plucks justice by the nose The baby beats the nurse , and quite athwart Goes all decorum .
Fair Katherine , and most fair , Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart
Your Majesty shall mock at me . I cannot speak your England .
O fair Katherine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue . Do you like me , Kate
Pardonnez moi , I cannot tell what is like me .
An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
Que dit il Que je suis semblable à les anges
Oui , vraiment , sauf votre Grâce , ainsi dit il .
Never , Regan . She hath abated me of half my train , Looked black upon me , struck me with her tongue , Most serpentlike , upon the very heart . All the stored vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones , You taking airs , with lameness
Fie , sir , fie
You nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty , You fen sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , To fall and blister
O the blessed gods So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on .
No , Regan , thou shalt never have my curse . Thy tender hafted nature shall not give Thee o er to harshness . Her eyes are fierce , but thine Do comfort and not burn . Tis not in thee To grudge my pleasures , to cut off my train , To bandy hasty words , to scant my sizes , And in conclusion to oppose the bolt Against my coming in . Thou better know’st The offices of nature , bond of childhood , Effects of courtesy , dues of gratitude . Thy half o th kingdom hast thou not forgot , Wherein I thee endowed .
Good sir , to the purpose .
Who put my man i th stocks
These many , then , shall die . Their names are pricked .
Your brother too must die . Consent you , Lepidus
I do consent
Prick him down , Antony .
Upon condition Publius shall not live , Who is your sister’s son , Mark Antony .
He shall not live . Look , with a spot I damn him . But , Lepidus , go you to Caesar’s house . Fetch the will hither , and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies .
What , shall I find you here
Or here , or at the Capitol .
This is a slight , unmeritable man , Meet to be sent on errands . Is it fit , The threefold world divided , he should stand One of the three to share it
Go , carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet . Take all his company along with him .
My lord , my lord
I cannot now speak . I will hear you soon . Take them away .
Should have a back or second that might hold If this should blast in proof . Soft , let me see . We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings . I ha ’t When in your motion you are hot and dry , As make your bouts more violent to that end , And that he calls for drink , I’ll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce , whereon but sipping , If he by chance escape your venomed stuck , Our purpose may hold there . But stay , what noise
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel , So fast they follow . Your sister’s drowned , Laertes .
Drowned Oh , where
There is a willow grows aslant a brook That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream . There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crowflowers , nettles , daisies , and long purples , That liberal shepherds give a grosser name , But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them . There , on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang , an envious sliver broke , When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook . Her clothes spread wide , And mermaid like a while they bore her up , Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds As one incapable of her own distress , Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element . But long it could not be Till that her garments , heavy with their drink , Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death .
We are all undone , unless The noble man have mercy .
Who shall ask it The tribunes cannot do’t for shame the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds for his best friends , if they Should say ‘Be good to Rome , ’ they charged him even As those should do that had deserved his hate , And therein show’d like enemies .
’Tis true If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it , I have not the face To say ‘Beseech you , cease . ’ You have made fair hands , You and your crafts you have crafted fair
You have brought A trembling upon Rome , such as was never So incapable of help .
Say not we brought it .
What trumpet’s that
How Was it we we loved him but , like beasts And cowardly nobles , gave way unto your clusters , Who did hoot him out o’ the city .
I know ’t my sister’s . This approves her letter That she would soon be here . Is your lady come
But I fear They’ll roar him in again . Tullus Aufidius , The second name of men , obeys his points As if he were his officer desperation Is all the policy , strength and defence , That Rome can make against them .
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows . Out , varlet , from my sight
What means your grace
Who stocked my servant Regan , I have good hope Thou didst not know on ’t . Who comes here O heavens , If you do love old men , if your sweet sway Allow obedience , if yourselves are old , Make it your cause . Send down , and take my part Art not ashamed to look upon this beard O Regan , wilt thou take her by the hand
Why not by th hand , sir How have I offended All’s not offense that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so .
O sides , you are too tough . Will you yet hold How came my man i th stocks
So you thought him . And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription .
Octavius , I have seen more days than you . And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , To groan and sweat under the business , Either led or driven , as we point the way . And having brought our treasure where we will , Then take we down his load and turn him off , Like to the empty ass , to shake his ears And graze in commons .
You may do your will , But he’s a tried and valiant soldier .
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that I do appoint him store of provender . It is a creature that I teach to fight , To wind , to stop , to run directly on , His corporal motion governed by my spirit , And , in some taste , is Lepidus but so . He must be taught and trained and bid go forth , A barren spirited fellow , one that feeds On objects , arts , and imitations , Which , out of use and staled by other men , Begin his fashion . Do not talk of him But as a property . And now , Octavius , Listen great things . Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers . We must straight make head . Therefore let our alliance be combined , Our best friends made , our means stretched .
I said so , dear Katherine and I must not blush to affirm it .
Ô bon Dieu Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies .
What says she , fair one That the tongues of men are full of deceits
Si fortune me tormenta , spero me contenta .
Oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de princess .
I like this fair proceeding of the King’s . He hath intent his wonted followers Shall all be very well provided for , But all are banished till their conversations Appear more wise and modest to the world .
The princess is the better Englishwoman . I faith , Kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding . I am glad thou canst speak no better English , for if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown . I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , I love you . Then if you urge me farther than to say , Do you , in faith I wear out my suit . Give me your answer , i faith , do and so clap hands and a bargain . How say you , lady
And so they are .
Sauf votre honneur , me understand vell .
The King hath called his parliament , my lord .
Marry , if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake , Kate , why you undid me . For the one , I have neither words nor measure and for the other , I have no strength in measure , yet a reasonable measure in strength . If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken , I should quickly leap into a wife . Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors , I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes , never off . But , before God , Kate , I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence , nor I have no cunning in protestation , only
He hath .
I will lay odds that , ere this year expire , We bear our civil swords and native fire As far as France I beard a bird so sing , Whose music , to my thinking , pleased the King . Come , will you hence
It rested in your grace To unloose this tied up justice when you pleased And it in you more dreadful would have seem’d Than in Lord Angelo .
I do fear , too dreadful Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope , ’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them For what I bid them do for we bid this be done , When evil deeds have their permissive pass And not the punishment . Therefore indeed , my father , I have on Angelo imposed the office Who may , in the ambush of my name , strike home , And yet my nature never in the fight To do in slander . And to behold his sway , I will , as ’twere a brother of your order , Visit both prince and people therefore , I prithee , Supply me with the habit and instruct me How I may formally in person bear me Like a true friar . More reasons for this action At our more leisure shall I render you Only , this one Lord Angelo is precise Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses That his blood flows , or that his appetiteA Biblical reference , specifically Matthew 7 Or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone That his blood flows , or that his appetite Is more to bread than stoneA Biblical reference , specifically Matthew 7 Or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone Is more to bread than stone hence shall we see , If power change purpose , what our seemers be .
I set him there , sir , but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement .
With this there grows In my most ill composed affection such A stanchless avarice that , were I king , I should cut off the nobles for their lands , Desire his jewels and this other’s house . And my more having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal , Destroying them for wealth .
You Did you
This avarice Sticks deeper , grows with more pernicious root Than summer seeming lust , and it hath been The sword of our slain kings . Yet do not fear Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will , Of your mere own . All these are portable , With other graces weighed .
I pray you , father , being weak , seem so . If till the expiration of your month , You will return and sojourn with my sister , Dismissing half your train , come then to me . I am now from home , and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment .
And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosed , And open perils surest answered .
Return to her , and fifty men dismissed No , rather I abjure all roofs , and choose To be a comrade with the wolf and owl To wage against the enmity o th air Necessity’s sharp pinch Return with her Why , the hot blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born I could as well be brought To knee his throne , and , squirelike , pension beg To keep base life afoot . Return with her Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom .
Let us do so . For we are at the stake And bayed about with many enemies . And some that smile have in their hearts , I fear , Millions of mischiefs .
At your choice , sir .
Now , I prithee , daughter , do not make me mad . I will not trouble thee , my child . Farewell . We’ll no more meet , no more see one another . But yet thou art my flesh , my blood , my daughter Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh , Which I must needs call mine . Thou art a boil , A plague sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood . But I’ll not chide thee . Let shame come when it will . I do not call it .
But I have none . The king becoming graces , As justice , verity , temperance , stableness , Bounty , perseverance , mercy , lowliness , Devotion , patience , courage , fortitude , I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime , Acting it many ways . Nay , had I power , I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell , Uproar the universal peace , confound All unity on earth .
O Scotland , Scotland
If such a one be fit to govern , speak . I am as I have spoken .
downright oaths , which I never use till urged , nor never break for urging . If thou canst love a fellow of this temper , Kate , whose face is not worth sunburning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook . I speak to thee plain soldier . If thou canst love me for this , take me . If not , to say to thee that I shall die is true , but for thy love , by the Lord , no . Yet I love thee too . And while thou liv’st , dear Kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places . For these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies favors , they do always reason themselves out again . What A speaker is but a prater , a rhyme is but a ballad , a good leg will fall , a straight back will stoop , a black beard will turn white , a curled pate will grow bald , a fair face will wither , a full eye will wax hollow , but a good heart , Kate , is the sun and the moon , or rather the sun and not the moon , for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly . If thou would have such a one , take me . And take me , take a soldier . Take a soldier , take a king . And what say’st thou then to my love Speak , my fair , and fairly , I pray thee .
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate . But , in loving me , you should love the friend of France , for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it . I will have it all mine . And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then yours is France and you are mine .
I cannot tell wat is dat .
First my fear then my curtsy , last my speech . My fear is your displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech , to beg your pardons . If you look for a good speech now , you undo me , for what I have to say is of mine own making , and what indeed I should say will , I doubt , prove mine own marring . But to the purpose , and so to the venture . Be it known to you , as it is very well , I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better . I meant indeed to pay you with this , which , if like an ill venture it come unluckily home , I break , and you , my gentle creditors , lose . Here I promised you I would be , and here I commit my body to your mercies . Bate me some , and I will pay you some , and , as most debtors do , promise you infinitely . And so I kneel down before you , but , indeed , to pray for the Queen . If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me , will you command me to use my legs And yet that were but light payment , to dance out of your debt . But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction , and so would I . All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me if the gentlemen will not , then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen , which was never seen before in such an assembly . One word more , I beseech you if you be not too much cloyed with fat meat , our humble author will continue the story , with Sir John in it , and make you merry with fair Katherine of France , where , for anything I know , Falstaff shall die of a sweat , unless already he be killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr , and this is not the man . My tongue is weary when my legs are too , I will bid you good night .
I do not bid the thunder bearer shoot , Nor tell tales of thee to high judging Jove . Mend when thou canst . Be better at thy leisure . I can be patient . I can stay with Regan , I and my hundred knights .
Not altogether so , sir . I looked not for you yet , nor am provided For your fit welcome . Give ear , sir , to my sister . For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old , and so But she knows what she does .
Is this well spoken now
I dare avouch it , sir . What , fifty followers Is it not well What should you need of more Yea , or so many sith that both charge and danger Speak gainst so great a number How , in one house , Should many people under two commands Hold amity Tis hard almost impossible .
Why might not you , my lord , receive attendance From those that she calls servants , or from mine
Why not , my lord If then they chanced to slack you , We could control them . If you will come to me For now I spy a danger I entreat you To bring but five and twenty . To no more Will I give place or notice .
I gave you all
And in good time you gave it .
And have you nuns no farther privileges
Are not these large enough
Yes , truly I speak not as desiring more But rather wishing a more strict restraint Upon the sisterhood , the votarists of Saint Clare .
Ho Peace be in this place
Who’s that which calls
It is a man’s voice . Gentle Isabella , Turn you the key , and know his business of him You may , I may not you are yet unsworn . When you have vow’d , you must not speak with men But in the presence of the priore Then , if you speak , you must not show your face , Or , if you show your face , you must not speak . He calls again I pray you , answer him .
Fit to govern No , not to live . O nation miserable , With an untitled tyrant bloody sceptered , When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again , Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed , And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father Was a most sainted king . The queen that bore thee , Oftener upon her knees than on her feet , Died every day she lived . Fare thee well These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself Have banished me from Scotland . O my breast , Thy hope ends here
Peace and prosperity Who is’t that calls
Macduff , this noble passion , Child of integrity , hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples , reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor . Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power , and modest wisdom plucks me From overcredulous haste . But God above Deal between thee and me , for even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction , here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself , For strangers to my nature . I am yet Unknown to woman , never was forsworn , Scarcely have coveted what was mine own , At no time broke my faith , would not betray The devil to his fellow , and delight No less in truth than life . My first false speaking Was this upon myself . What I am truly , Is thine and my poor country’s to command .
Hail , virgin , if you be , as those cheek roses Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella , A novice of this place and the fair sister To her unhappy brother Claudio
No , Kate I will tell thee in French , which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband’s neck , hardly to be shook off . Je quand sur le possession de France , et quand vous avez le possession de moi let me see , what then Saint Denis be my speed donc vôtre est France et vous êtes mienne . It is as easy for me , Kate , to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French . I shall never move thee in French , unless it be to laugh at me .
Sauf votre honneur , le français que vous parlez , il est meilleur que l anglais lequel je parle .
No , faith , is ’t not , Kate , but thy speaking of my tongue , and I thine , most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one . But , Kate , dost thou understand thus much English Canst thou love me
I cannot tell .
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate I’ll ask them . Come , I know thou lovest me and at night , when you come into your closet , you’ll question this gentlewoman about me , and , I know , Kate , you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart . But , good Kate , mock me mercifully , the rather , gentle princess , because I love thee cruelly . If ever thou beest mine , Kate , as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt , I get thee with scambling , and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder . Shall not thou and I , between Saint Denis
Made you my guardians , my depositaries , But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number . What , must I come to you With five and twenty , Regan Said you so
And speak ’t again , my lord . No more with me .
Those wicked creatures yet do look well favored When others are more wicked . Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise . I’ll go with thee . Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty , And thou art twice her love .
Stand , ho
Hear me , my lord . What need you five and twenty , ten , or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you
Give the word , ho , and stand .
What need one
What now , Lucillius Is Cassius near
He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master .
O , reason not the need Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous . Allow not nature more than nature needs , Man’s life’s as cheap as beast’s . Thou art a lady . If only to go warm were gorgeous , Why , nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st , Which scarcely keeps thee warm . But , for true need You heavens , give me that patience , patience I need . You see me here , you gods , a poor old man , As full of grief as age , wretched in both . If it be you that stir these daughters hearts Against their father , fool me not so much To bear it tamely . Touch me with noble anger . And let not women’s weapons , water drops , Stain my man’s cheeks No , you unnatural hags ,
He greets me well . Your master , Pindarus , In his own change or by ill officers Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done , undone . But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied .
I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is , full of regard and honor .
He is not doubted . A word , Lucillius . How he received you , let me be resolved .
With courtesy and with respect enough . But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old .
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling . Ever note , Lucillius , When love begins to sicken and decay , It useth an enforcèd ceremony . There are no tricks in plain and simple faith . But hollow men , like horses hot at hand , Make gallant show and promise of their mettle .
Alas , then she is drowned .
Drowned , drowned .
Why ‘her unhappy brother’ let me ask , The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella and his sister .
Gentle and fair , your brother kindly greets you Not to be weary with you , he’s in prison .
Too much of water hast thou , poor Ophelia , And therefore I forbid my tears . But yet It is our trick . Nature her custom holds , Let shame say what it will . When these are gone , The woman will be out . Adieu , my lord . I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze , But that this folly doubts it .
Woe me for what
Let’s follow , Gertrude . How much I had to do to calm his rage Now fear I this will give it start again . Therefore let’s follow .
For that which , if myself might be his judge , He should receive his punishment in thanks He hath got his friend with child .
Sir , make me not your story .
It is true . I would not though ’tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest , Tongue far from heart play with all virgins so I hold you as a thing ensky’d and sainted . By your renouncement an immortal spirit , And to be talk’d with in sincerity , As with a saint .
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me .
Do not believe it . Fewness and truth , ’tis thus Your brother and his lover have embraced As those that feed grow full , as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison , even so her plenteous womb Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry .
I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall I will do such things What they are yet I know not , but they shall be The terrors of the earth . You think I’ll weep No , I’ll not weep .
I have full cause of weeping , but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , Or ere I’ll weep . O Fool , I shall go mad
Let us withdraw . Twill be a storm .
This house is little . The old man and his people Cannot be well bestowed .
Tis his own blame . Hath put himself from rest , And must needs taste his folly .
For his particular I’ll receive him gladly , But not one follower .
So am I purposed . Where is my lord of Gloucester
Followed the old man forth . He is returned .
Here come the clusters . And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome , when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus’ exile . Now he’s coming And not a hair upon a soldier’s head Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down , And pay you for your voices . ’Tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal , We have deserved it .
The king is in high rage .
Faith , we hear fearful news .
For mine own part , When I said , banish him , I said ’twas pity .
And so did I .
And so did I and , to say the truth , so did very many of us that we did , we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment , yet it was against our will .
Ye are goodly things , you voices
You have made Good work , you and your cry Shall’s to the Capitol
Whither indeed , before thy here approach , Old Siward , with ten thousand warlike men , Already at a point , was setting forth . Now we’ll together , and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once Tis hard to reconcile .
Well , more anon . Comes the king forth , I pray you
Ay , sir there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure . Their malady convinces The great assay of art , but at his touch Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand They presently amend .
I thank you , doctor .
What’s the disease he means
Tis called the evil . A most miraculous work in this good king , Which often since my here remain in England I have seen him do . How he solicits heaven , Himself best knows , but strangely visited people , All swoll n and ulcerous , pitiful to the eye , The mere despair of surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stamp about their necks , Put on with holy prayers . And , ’tis spoken ,
and Saint George , compound a boy , half French , half English , that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard Shall we not What say’st thou , my fair flower de luce
I do not know dat .
No , ’tis hereafter to know , but now to promise . Do but now promise , Kate , you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor . How answer you , la plus belle Katherine du monde , mon très cher et divin déesse
Your Majestée ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France .
Now fie upon my false French . By mine honor , in true English , I love thee , Kate . By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me , yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost , notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage . Now , beshrew my father’s ambition He was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside , with an aspect of iron , that when I come to woo ladies , I fright them . But , in faith , Kate , the elder I wax , the better I shall appear . My comfort is that old age , that ill layer up of beauty , can do no more spoil upon my face . Thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better . And therefore tell me , most fair Katherine , will you have me Put off your maiden blushes , avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress , take me by the hand , and say Harry of England , I am thine , which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal , but I will tell
In sooth , I know not why I am so sad . It wearies me you say it wearies you . But how I caught it , found it , or came by it , What stuff ’tis made of , whereof it is born , I am to learn . And such a want wit sadness makes of me , That I have much ado to know myself .
Your mind is tossing on the ocean , There , where your argosies with portly sail , Like signors and rich burghers on the flood Or , as it were , the pageants of the sea Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them , do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings .
Believe me , sir , had I such venture forth , The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad . I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind , Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads . And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad .
Some one with child by him My cousin Juliet
But when they should endure the bloody spur , They fall their crests and , like deceitful jades , Sink in the trial . Comes his army on
Is she your cousin
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered . The greater part , the horse in general , Are come with Cassius .
Adoptedly as school maids change their names By vain though apt affection .
Hark He is arrived . March gently on to meet him .
She it is .
O , let him marry her .
Stand , ho
Stand , ho Speak the word along .
Whither is he going
Stand
He calls to horse , but will I know not whither .
This is the point . The duke is very strangely gone from hence Bore many gentlemen , myself being one , In hand and hope of action but we do learn By those that know the very nerves of state , His givings out were of an infinite distance From his true meant design . Upon his place , And with full line of his authority , Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood Is very snow broth one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense , But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind , study and fast . He to give fear to use and liberty , Which have for long run by the hideous law , As mice by lions hath pick’d out an act , Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life Falls into forfeit he arrests him on it And follows close the rigour of the statute , To make him an example . All hope is gone , Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo and that’s my pith of business ’Twixt you and your poor brother .
Stand
Tis best to give him way . He leads himself .
Stand
My lord , entreat him by no means to stay .
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
Alack , the night comes on , and the high winds Do sorely ruffle . For many miles about There’s scarce a bush .
Judge me , you gods Wrong I mine enemies And if not so , how should I wrong a brother
O sir , to wilful men , The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters . Shut up your doors . He is attended with a desperate train . And what they may incense him to , being apt To have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear .
Shut up your doors , my lord . Tis a wild night . My Regan counsels well . Come out o th storm .
thee aloud England is thine , Ireland is thine , France is thine , and Harry Plantagenet is thine , who , though I speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows . Come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy English broken . Therefore , queen of all , Katherine , break thy mind to me in broken English . Wilt thou have me
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon père .
Nay , it will please him well , Kate it shall please him , Kate .
Den it sall also content me .
Upon that I kiss your hand , and I call you my queen .
Laissez , mon seigneur , laissez , laissez Ma foi , je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d une Notre Seigneur indigne serviteur . Excusez moi , je vous supplie , mon très puissant eigneur .
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant leur noces , il n est pas la coutume de France .
Madam my interpreter , what says she
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish .
To kiss .
To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction . With this strange virtue , He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy , And sundry blessings hang about his throne , That speak him full of grace .
See , who comes here
My countryman , but yet I know him not .
My ever gentle cousin , welcome hither .
I know him now . Good God , betimes remove The means that makes us strangers
Sir , amen .
Stands Scotland where it did
Alas , poor country Almost afraid to know itself . It cannot Be called our mother , but our grave , where nothing , But who knows nothing , is once seen to smile Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made , not marked where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy . The dead man’s knell Is there scarce asked for who , and good men’s lives Expire before the flowers in their caps , Dying or ere they sicken .
Oh , relation Too nice and yet too true
Who’s there , besides foul weather
One minded like the weather , most unquietly .
I know you . Where’s the king
Contending with the fretful elements . Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curlèd water bove the main , That things might change or cease . Tears his white hair , Which the impetuous blasts , with eyeless rage , Catch in their fury and make nothing of . Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to and fro–conflicting wind and rain . This night wherein the cub drawn bear would couch , The lion and the belly pinchèd wolf Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs , And bids what will take all .
But who is with him
None but the fool , who labors to outjest His heart struck injuries .
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation
I tell thee she is . Therefore make her grave straight . The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial .
How can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defense
Doth he so seek his life
Why , ’tis found so .
Has censured him Already and , as I hear , the provost hath A warrant for his execution .
It must be se offendendo . It cannot be else . For here lies the point if I drown myself wittingly , it argues an act . And an act hath three branches it is to act , to do , to perform . Argal , she drowned herself wittingly .
Alas what poor ability’s in me To do him good
Nay , but hear you , Goodman Delver
Assay the power you have .
Give me leave . Here lies the water . Good . Here stands the man . Good . If the man go to this water and drown himself , it is , will he nill he , he goes . Mark you that . But if the water come to him and drown him , he drowns not himself . Argal , he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life .
My power Alas , I doubt
But is this law
Our doubts are traitors And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt . Go to Lord Angelo , And let him learn to know , when maidens sue , Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel , All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them .
I’ll see what I can do .
But speedily .
I will about it straight No longer staying but to give the mother Notice of my affair . I humbly thank you Commend me to my brother soon at night I’ll send him certain word of my success .
I take my leave of you .
O , ay , what else
Go , masters , get you home be not dismay’d These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem to fear . Go home , And show no sign of fear .
The gods be good to us Come , masters , let’s home . I ever said we were i’ the wrong when we banished him .
So did we all . But , come , let’s home .
I do not like this news .
Nor I .
Your Majesté entendre bettre que moi .
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , would she say
Oui , vraiment .
O Kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings . Dear Kate , you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion . We are the makers of manners , Kate , and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find faults , as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss . Therefore , patiently and yielding . You have witchcraft in your lips , Kate . There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council , and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs . Here comes your father .
God save your Majesty . My royal cousin , teach you our princess English
Let’s to the Capitol . Would half my wealth Would buy this for a lie
I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her , and that is good English .
Pray , let us go .
Is she not apt
Our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth , so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness .
What’s the newest grief
That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker . Each minute teems a new one .
How does my wife
Why , well .
And all my children
Well too .
The tyrant has not battered at their peace
No , they were well at peace when I did leave em .
Be not a niggard of your speech . How goes ’t
When I came hither to transport the tidings , Which I have heavily borne , there ran a rumor Of many worthy fellows that were out Which was to my belief witnessed the rather For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot . Now is the time of help . Your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers , make our women fight , To doff their dire distresses .
Be ’t their comfort We are coming thither . Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out .
Good sir , adieu .
My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great at sea might do . I should not see the sandy hourglass run , But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand , Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial . Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks , Which , touching but my gentle vessel’s side , Would scatter all her spices on the stream , Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks , And , in a word , but even now worth this , And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought To think on this , and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad But tell not me . I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise .
Believe me , no . I thank my fortune for it My ventures are not in one bottom trusted , Nor to one place , nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year . Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
Why then , you are in love .
Fie , fie
Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry and ’twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad . Now , by two headed Janus , Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time .
Ay , marry , is ’t . Crowner’s quest law .
Will you ha the truth on ’t If this had not been a gentlewoman , she should have been buried out o Christian burial .
Why , there thou sayst . And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian . Come , my spade . There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners , ditchers , and grave makers . They hold up Adam’s profession .
Was he a gentleman
He was the first that ever bore arms .
Why , he had none .
What , art a heathen How dost thou understand the Scripture The Scripture says Adam digged . Could he dig without arms I’ll put another question to thee . If thou answerest me not to the purpose , confess thyself
Go to .
What is he that builds stronger than either the mason , the shipwright , or the carpenter
The gallows maker , for that frame outlives a thousand tenants .
Sir , I do know you , And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you . There is division , Although as yet the face of it be covered With mutual cunning , ’twixt Albany and Cornwall , Who have as who have not that their great stars Throned and set high servants , who seem no less , Which are to France the spies and speculations Intelligent of our state . What hath been seen , Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes , Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne Against the old kind king , or something deeper , Whereof perchance these are but furnishings But true it is . From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom , who already , Wise in our negligence , have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner . Now to you . If on my credit you dare build so far To make your speed to Dover , you shall find Some that will thank you , making just report Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow The king hath cause to plain . I am a gentleman of blood and breeding , And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you .
I like thy wit well , in good faith . The gallows does well , but how does it well It does well to those that do ill .
Brutus , this sober form of yours hides wrongs . And when you do them
Cassius , be content . Speak your griefs softly . I do know you well . Before the eyes of both our armies here , Which should perceive nothing but love from us , Let us not wrangle . Bid them move away . Then in my tent , Cassius , enlarge your griefs , And I will give you audience .
Pindarus , Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground .
Lucillius , do you the like . And let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference . Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door .
I will talk further with you .
We must not make a scarecrow of the law , Setting it up to fear the birds of prey , And let it keep one shape , till custom make it Their perch and not their terror .
Ay , but yet Let us be keen , and rather cut a little , Than fall , and bruise to death . Alas , this gentleman Whom I would save had a most noble father Let but your honour know , Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue , That , in the working of your own affections , Had time cohered with place or place with wishing , Or that the resolute acting of your blood Could have attain’d the effect of your own purpose , Whether you had not sometime in your life Err’d in this point which now you censure him , And pull’d the law upon you .
’Tis one thing to be tempted , Escalus , Another thing to fall . I not deny , The jury , passing on the prisoner’s life , May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try . What’s open made to justice , That justice seizes what know the laws That thieves do pass on thieves ’Tis very pregnant , The jewel that we find , we stoop and take’t Because we see it but what we do not see We tread upon , and never think of it . You may not so extenuate his offence For I have had such faults but rather tell me , When I , that censure him , do so offend , Let mine own judgment pattern out my death , And nothing come in partial . Sir , he must die .
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper , And other of such vinegar aspect That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable .
Here comes Bassanio , your most noble kinsman , Gratiano , and Lorenzo . Fare ye well . We leave you now with better company .
I would have stayed till I had made you merry If worthier friends had not prevented me .
Your worth is very dear in my regard . I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th occasion to depart .
Good morrow , my good lords .
Good signors both , when shall we laugh Say , when You grow exceeding strange . Must it be so
We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours .
My Lord Bassanio , since you have found Antonio , We two will leave you . But at dinnertime I pray you have in mind where we must meet .
I will not fail you .
Be it as your wisdom will .
Where is the provost
Here , if it like your honour .
See that Claudio Be executed by nine to morrow morning Bring him his confessor , let him be prepared For that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage .
Well , heaven forgive him and forgive us all Some rise by sin , and some by virtue fall Some run from brakes of ice , and answer none And some condemned for a fault alone .
Come , bring them away if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses , I know no law bring them away .
How now , sir What’s your name and what’s the matter
If it Please your honour , I am the poor duke’s constable , and my name is Elbow I do lean upon justice , sir , and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors .
Benefactors Well what benefactors are they are they not malefactors
Do they still fly to the Roman
I do not know what witchcraft’s in him , but Your soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat , Their talk at table , and their thanks at end And you are darken’d in this action , sir , Even by your own .
I cannot help it now , Unless , by using means , I lame the foot Of our design . He bears himself more proudlier , Even to my person , than I thought he would When first I did embrace him yet his nature In that’s no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amended .
Yet I wish , sir , I mean for your particular , you had not Join’d in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself , or else To him had left it solely .
I understand thee well and be thou sure , when he shall come to his account , he knows not What I can urge against him . Although it seems , And so he thinks , and is no less apparent To the vulgar eye , that he bears all things fairly . And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state , Fights dragon like , and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine , Whene’er we come to our account .
You look not well , Signor Antonio . You have too much respect upon the world . They lose it that do buy it with much care . Believe me , you are marvelously changed .
I hold the world but as the world , Gratiano A stage where every man must play a part , And mine a sad one .
Would I could answer This comfort with the like . But I have words That would be howled out in the desert air , Where hearing should not latch them .
What concern they The general cause , or is it a fee grief Due to some single breast
No mind that’s honest But in it shares some woe , though the main part Pertains to you alone .
If it be mine , Keep it not from me . Quickly let me have it .
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever , Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard .
Hum I guess at it .
Your castle is surprised , your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered . To relate the manner , Were , on the quarry of these murdered deer To add the death of you .
Merciful heaven What , man Ne er pull your hat upon your brows . Give sorrow words . The grief that does not speak Whispers the o erfraught heart and bids it break .
My children too
Wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
If it please your honour , I know not well what they are but precise villains they are , that I am sure of and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have .
This comes off well here’s a wise officer .
Go to what quality are they of Elbow is your name why dost thou not speak , Elbow
Let me play the fool . With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come . And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans . Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster , Sleep when he wakes , and creep into the jaundice By being peevish I tell thee what , Antonio I love thee , and ’tis my love that speaks There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond , And do a willful stillness entertain With purpose to be dressed in an opinion Of wisdom , gravity , profound conceit , As who should say , I am Sir Oracle , And when I ope my lips , let no dog bark O my Antonio , I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing , when I am very sure If they should speak , would almost damn those ears Which , hearing them , would call their brothers fools . I’ll tell thee more of this another time . But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon , this opinion . Come , good Lorenzo . Fare ye well awhile . I’ll end my exhortation after dinner .
He cannot , sir he’s out at elbow .
What are you , sir
He , sir a tapster , sir parcel bawd one that serves a bad woman whose house , sir , was , as they say , plucked down in the suburbs and now she professes a hot house , which , I think , is a very ill house too .
How know you that
My wife , sir , whom I detest before heaven and your honour ,
Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church . Argal , the gallows may do well to thee . To ’t again , come .
How thy wife
Who builds stronger than a mason , a shipwright , or a carpenter
Ay , sir whom , I thank heaven , is an honest woman ,
Ay , tell me that , and unyoke .
Dost thou detest her therefore
Marry , now I can tell .
To ’t .
I say , sir , I will detest myself also , as well as she , that this house , if it be not a bawd’s house , it is pity of her life , for it is a naughty house .
Mass , I cannot tell .
How dost thou know that , constable
Cudgel thy brains no more about it , for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating . And when you are asked this question next , say A grave maker . The houses that he makes last till doomsday . Go , get thee in . Fetch me a stoup of liquor .
In youth when I did love , did love , Methought it was very sweet To contract–o–the time , for–a–my behove , Oh , methought , there–a–was nothing–a–meet .
Has this fellow no feeling of his business He sings at grave making .
That you have wronged me doth appear in this You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians , Wherein my letters , praying on his side Because I knew the man , were slighted off .
You wronged yourself to write in such a case .
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment .
Let me tell you , Cassius , you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm , To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers .
I an itching palm You know that you are Brutus that speak this , Or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .
The name of Cassius honors this corruption , And chastisement doth therefore hide his head .
Chastisement
Remember March , the ides of March remember . Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake
No , do not . For confirmation that I am much more Than my outwall , open this purse and take What it contains . If you shall see Cordelia As fear not but you shall show her this ring . And she will tell you who that fellow is That yet you do not know . Fie on this storm I will go seek the king .
Give me your hand . Have you no more to say
Few words , but to effect more than all yet That when we have found the king in which your pain That way I’ll this he that first lights on him Holla the other .
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that . If you would conjure in her , you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind . Can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
Yet they do wink and yield , as love is blind and enforces .
They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
Then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
I will wink on her to consent , my lord , if you will teach her to know my meaning , for maids , well summered and warm kept , are like flies at Bartholomew tide blind , though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling , which before would not abide looking on .
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer . And so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .
As love is , my lord , before it loves .
It is so . And you may , some of you , thank love for my blindness , who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way .
Yes , my lord , you see them perspectively , the cities turned into a maid , for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered .
Marry , sir , by my wife who , if she had been a woman cardinally given , might have been accused in fornication , adultery , and all uncleanliness there .
By the woman’s means
Ay , sir , by Mistress Overdone’s means but as she spit in his face , so she defied him .
Sir , if it please your honour , this is not so .
Prove it before these varlets here , thou honourable man prove it .
Do you hear how he misplaces
Sir , she came in great with child and longing , saving your honour’s reverence , for stewed prunes sir , we had but two in the house , which at that very distant time stood , as it were , in a fruit dish , a dish of some three pence your honours have seen such dishes they are not China dishes , but very good dishes ,
Go to , go to no matter for the dish , sir .
No , indeed , sir , not of a pin you are therein in the right but to the point . As I say , this Mistress Elbow , being , as I say , with child , and being great bellied , and longing , as I said , for prunes and having but two in the dish , as I said , Master Froth here , this very man , having eaten the rest , as I said , and , as I say , paying for them very honestly for , as you know , Master Froth , I could not give you three pence again .
Sir , I beseech you , think you he’ll carry Rome
All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The senators and patricians love him too The tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal , as hasty To expel him thence . I think he’ll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish , who takes it By sovereignty of nature . First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even whether ’twas pride , Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment , To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature , Not to be other than one thing , not moving From the casque to the cushion , but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controll’d the war but one of these As he hath spices of them all , not all , For I dare so far free him made him fear’d , So hated , and so banish’d but he has a merit , To choke it in the utterance . So our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time And power , unto itself most commendable , Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair To extol what it hath done . One fire drives out one fire one nail , one nail Rights by rights falter , strengths by strengths do fail . Come , let’s away . When , Caius , Rome is thine , Thou art poor’st of all then shortly art thou mine .
And I must be from thence My wife killed too
I have said .
Be comforted . Let’s make us med cines of our great revenge , To cure this deadly grief .
He has no children . All my pretty ones Did you say all O hell kite All What , all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop
Dispute it like a man .
I shall do so , But I must also feel it as a man . I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me . Did heaven look on , And would not take their part Sinful Macduff , They were all struck for thee Naught that I am , Not for their own demerits , but for mine , Fell slaughter on their souls . Heaven rest them now .
Be this the whetstone of your sword . Let grief Convert to anger . Blunt not the heart , enrage it .
Oh , I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue But , gentle heavens , Cut short all intermission . Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself . Within my sword’s length set him if he ’scape , Heaven forgive him too .
Well , we will leave you then till dinnertime . I must be one of these same dumb wise men , For Gratiano never lets me speak .
Well , keep me company but two years more , Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue .
Farewell . I’ll grow a talker for this gear .
Thanks , i faith , for silence is only commendable In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible .
Is that any thing now
What villain touched his body , that did stab , And not for justice What , shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers , shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes , And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be graspèd thus I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman .
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all Venice . His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them , and when you have them they are not worth the search .
Brutus , bait not me . I’ll not endure it . You forget yourself To hedge me in . I am a soldier , I , Older in practice , abler than yourself To make conditions .
Well , tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , That you today promised to tell me of
Go to . You are not , Cassius .
I am .
Tis not unknown to you , Antonio , How much I have disabled mine estate , By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance . Nor do I now make moan to be abridged From such a noble rate . But my chief care
I say you are not .
Urge me no more , I shall forget myself . Have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
Away , slight man
Is ’t possible
Hear me , for I will speak . Must I give way and room to your rash choler Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
O ye gods , ye gods , must I endure all this
No , indeed .
Very well you being then , if you be remembered , cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes ,
Ay , so I did indeed .
Why , very well I telling you then , if you be remembered , that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of , unless they kept very good diet , as I told you ,
All this is true .
Why , very well , then ,
Come , you are a tedious fool to the purpose . What was done to Elbow’s wife , that he hath cause to complain of Come me to what was done to her .
Sir , your honour cannot come to that yet .
No , sir , nor I mean it not .
Sir , but you shall come to it , by your honour’s leave . And , I beseech you , look into Master Froth here , sir a man of four score pound a year whose father died at Hallowmas was’t not at Hallowmas , Master Froth
All hallond eve .
Why , very well I hope here be truths . He , sir , sitting , as I say , in a lower chair , sir ’twas in the Bunch of Grapes , where indeed you have a delight to sit , have you not
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness .
Tis e en so . The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense .

That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once . How the knave jowls it to the ground , as if it were Cain’s jawbone , that did the first murder It might be the pate of a politician , which this ass now o erreaches , one that would circumvent God , might it not
Blow , winds , and crack your cheeks Rage , blow You cataracts and hurricanoes , spout Till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks You sulfurous and thought executing fires , Vaunt couriers of oak cleaving thunderbolts , Singe my white head And thou , all shaking thunder , Smite flat the thick rotundity o th world , Crack nature’s molds , all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man
It might , my lord .
O nuncle , court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o door . Good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing . Here’s a night pities neither wise man nor fool .
Or of a courtier , which could say , Good morrow , sweet lord How dost thou , good lord This might be my Lord Such a one that praised my Lord Such a one’s horse when he meant to beg it , might it not
Ay , my lord .
Rumble thy bellyful Spit , fire Spout , rain Nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters . I tax not you , you elements , with unkindness . I never gave you kingdom , called you children . You owe me no subscription . Why then , let fall Your horrible pleasure . Here I stand , your slave A poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man . But yet I call you servile ministers , That will with two pernicious daughters joined Your high engendered battles gainst a head So old and white as this . Oh , ho Tis foul .
Why , e en so . And now my Lady Worm’s , chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade . Here’s fine revolution , an we had the trick to see ’t . Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with them Mine ache to think on ’t .
He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good headpiece . The codpiece that will house
All this Ay , more . Fret till your proud heart break . Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble . Must I budge Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor By the gods , You shall digest the venom of your spleen , Though it do split you . For from this day forth , I’ll use you for my mirth , yea , for my laughter , When you are waspish .
Is it come to this
You say you are a better soldier . Let it appear so . Make your vaunting true , And it shall please me well . For mine own part , I shall be glad to learn of noble men .
You wrong me every way . You wrong me , Brutus . I said an elder soldier , not a better . Did I say better
If you did , I care not .
This tune goes manly . Come , go we to the king . Our power is ready Our lack is nothing but our leave . Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the powers above Put on their instruments . Receive what cheer you may . The night is long that never finds the day .
When Caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
Peace , peace You durst not so have tempted him .
I durst not
No .
What , durst not tempt him
Shall Kate be my wife
So please you .
I am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her . So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gaged . To you , Antonio , I owe the most in money and in love , And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe .
I pray you , good Bassanio , let me know it . And if it stand , as you yourself still do , Within the eye of honor , be assured My purse , my person , my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions .
In my school days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advisèd watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both , I oft found both . I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence . I owe you much , and , like a willful youth , That which I owe is lost . But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first , I do not doubt , As I will watch the aim , or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first .
You know me well , and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance . And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have . Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done , And I am pressed unto it . Therefore speak .
We have consented to all terms of reason .
Is ’t so , my lords of England
The king hath granted every article , His daughter first , and , in sequel , all , According to their firm proposed natures .
Only he hath not yet subscribèd this Where your Majesty demands that the king of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition , in French Notre très cher fils Henri , roi d Angleterre , héritier de France and thus in Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus , rex Angliae , et haeres Franciae .
Nor this I have not , brother , so denied But your request shall make me let it pass .
I pray you , then , in love and dear alliance , Let that one article rank with the rest , And thereupon give me your daughter .
Take her , fair son , and from her blood raise up Issue to me , that the contending kingdoms Of France and England , whose very shores look pale With envy of each other’s happiness ,
For your life you durst not .
Do not presume too much upon my love . I may do that I shall be sorry for .
You have done that you should be sorry for . There is no terror , Cassius , in your threats , For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind , Which I respect not . I did send to you For certain sums of gold , which you denied me , For I can raise no money by vile means . By heaven , I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection . I did send To you for gold to pay my legions , Which you denied me . Was that done like Cassius Should I have answered Caius Cassius so When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends , Be ready , gods , with all your thunderbolts . Dash him to pieces
I denied you not .
You did .
I did not . He was but a fool that brought My answer back . Brutus hath rived my heart . A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities , But Brutus makes mine greater than they are .
I do not , till you practice them on me .
I have so because it is an open room and good for winter .
Why , very well , then I hope here be truths .
This will last out a night in Russia , When nights are longest there I’ll take my leave . And leave you to the hearing of the cause Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all .
I think no less . Good morrow to your lordship .
Now , sir , come on what was done to Elbow’s wife , once more
Once , sir there was nothing done to her once .
I beseech you , sir , ask him what this man did to my wife .
I beseech your honour , ask me .
Well , sir what did this gentleman to her
I beseech you , sir , look in this gentleman’s face . Good Master Froth , look upon his honour ’tis for a good purpose . Doth your honour mark his face
Ay , sir , very well .
Nay I beseech you , mark it well .
Well , I do so .
Doth your honour see any harm in his face
Why , no .
I’ll be supposed upon a book , his face is the worst thing about him . Good , then if his face be the worst thing about him , how could Master Froth do the constable’s wife any harm I would know that of your honour .
In Belmont is a lady richly left , And she is fair and fairer than that word Of wondrous virtues . Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages . Her name is Portia , nothing undervalued To Cato’s daughter , Brutus Portia . Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth , For the four winds blow in from every coast Renownèd suitors , and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece , Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strand , And many Jasons come in quest of her . O my Antonio , had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them , I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate
Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea . Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum . Therefore go forth , Try what my credit can in Venice do That shall be racked even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont , to fair Portia . Go presently inquire , and so will I , Where money is , and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake .
No , I’ll not go you hear what he hath said Which was sometime his general who loved him In a most dear particular . He call’d me father But what o’ that Go , you that banish’d him A mile before his tent fall down , and knee The way into his mercy nay , if he coy’d To hear Cominius speak , I’ll keep at home .
He would not seem to know me .
Do you hear
Yet one time he did call me by my name I urged our old acquaintance , and the drops That we have bled together . Coriolanus He would not answer to forbad all names He was a kind of nothing , titleless , Till he had forged himself a name o’ the fire Of burning Rome .
Why , so you have made good work A pair of tribunes that have rack’d for Rome , To make coals cheap , a noble memory
I minded him how royal ’twas to pardon When it was less expected he replied , It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punish’d .

There’s another . Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer Where be his quiddities now , his quillities , his cases , his tenures , and his tricks Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery Hum This fellow might be in ’s time a great buyer of land , with his statutes , his recognizances , his fines , his double vouchers , his recoveries . Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases , and double ones too , than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box , and must the inheritor himself have no more , ha
Not a jot more , my lord .
Is not parchment made of sheepskins
Ay , my lord , and of calfskins too .
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that . I will speak to this fellow . Whose grave’s this , sirrah
Mine , sir .
Before the head has any The head and he shall louse . So beggars marry many . The man that makes his toe What he his heart should make Shall of a corn cry woe , And turn his sleep to wake . For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
No , I will be the pattern of all patience . I will say nothing .
Who’s there
Marry , here’s grace and a codpiece that’s a wise man and a fool .
Alas , sir , are you here Things that love night Love not such nights as these . The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep their caves . Snce I was man , Such sheets of fire , such bursts of horrid thunder , Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never Remember to have heard . Man’s nature cannot carry Th affliction nor the fear .
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o er our heads Find out their enemies now . Tremble , thou wretch That hast within thee undivulgèd crimes Unwhipped of justice . Hide thee , thou bloody hand , Thou perjured , and thou simular man of virtue
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report . When was it she last walked
Since his majesty went into the field , I have seen her rise from her bed , throw her nightgown upon her , unlock her closet , take forth paper , fold it , write upon ’t , read it , afterwards seal it , and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep .
A great perturbation in nature , to receive at once the benefit of sleep , and do the line>effects of watching . In this slumbery agitation , besides her walking and other actual performances , what , at any time , have you heard her say
That , sir , which I will not report after her .
You may to me , and ’tis most meet you should .
Neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
Lo you , here she comes . This is her very guise and , upon my life , fast asleep . Observe her , stand close .
How came she by that light
May cease their hatred , and this dear conjunction Plant neighborhood and Christian like accord In their sweet bosoms , that never war advance His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France .
Amen .
Now welcome , Kate , and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
God , the best maker of all marriages , Combine your hearts in one , your realms in one . As man and wife , being two , are one in love , So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal That never may ill office or fell jealousy , Which troubles oft the bed of blessèd marriage , Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms To make divorce of their incorporate league , That English may as French , French Englishmen , Receive each other . God speak this amen
Amen .
Prepare we for our marriage on which day , My Lord of Burgundy , we’ll take your oath , And all the peers , for surety of our leagues . Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me , And may our oaths well kept and prosp rous be .
You love me not .
I do not like your faults .
A friendly eye could never see such faults .
A flatterer’s would not , though they do appear As huge as high Olympus .
Come , Antony , and young Octavius , come , Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius , For Cassius is aweary of the world Hated by one he loves braved by his brother Checked like a bondman , all his faults observed , Set in a notebook , learned , and conned by rote To cast into my teeth . Oh , I could weep My spirit from mine eyes . There is my dagger . And here my naked breast . Within , a heart Dearer than Plutus mine , richer than gold . If that thou beest a Roman , take it forth . I , that denied thee gold , will give my heart . Strike , as thou didst at Caesar . For I know When thou didst hate him worst , thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius .
Sheathe your dagger . Be angry when you will , it shall have scope . Do what you will , dishonor shall be humor . O Cassius , you are yokèd with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire , Who , much enforcèd , shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again .
Very well Could he say less
I offer’d to awaken his regard For’s private friends his answer to me was , He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff he said ’twas folly , For one poor grain or two , to leave unburnt , And still to nose the offence .
For one poor grain or two I am one of those his mother , wife , his child , And this brave fellow too , we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon we must be burnt for you .
Nay , pray , be patient if you refuse your aid In this so never needed help , yet do not Upbraid’s with our distress . But , sure , if you Would be your country’s pleader , your good tongue , More than the instant army we can make , Might stop our countryman .
No , I’ll not meddle .
Pray you , go to him .
What should I do
Only make trial what your love can do For Rome , towards Martius .
By my troth , Nerissa , my little body is aweary of this great world .
You would be , sweet madam , if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are . And yet for aught I see , they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing . It is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean . Superfluity comes sooner by white hairs , but competency lives longer .
Good sentences , and well pronounced .
They would be better if well followed .
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do , chapels had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes palaces . It is a good divine that follows his own instructions . I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching . The brain may devise laws for the blood , but a hot temper leaps o er a cold decree . Such a hare is madness the youth to skip o er the meshes of good counsel the cripple . But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband . O me , the word choose I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father . Is it not hard , Nerissa , that I cannot choose one nor refuse none
Oh , a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet .
I think it be thine , indeed , for thou liest in ’t .
You lie out on ’t , sir , and therefore it is not yours . For my part , I do not lie in ’t , and yet it is mine .
Thou dost lie in ’t , to be in ’t and say it is thine . Tis for the dead , not for the quick . Therefore thou liest .
Tis a quick lie , sir . Twill away gain from me to you .
What man dost thou dig it for
For no man , sir .
What woman , then
For none , neither .
Who is to be buried in ’t
One that was a woman , sir , but , rest her soul , she’s dead .
How absolute the knave is We must speak by the card , or equivocation will undo us . By the Lord , Horatio , these three years I have taken a note of it . The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe . How long hast thou been a grave maker
Of all the days i the year , I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras .
Why , it stood by her . She has light by her continually . Tis her command .
You see her eyes are open .
Ay , but their sense is shut .
What is it she does now Look , how she rubs her hands .
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands . I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour .
Yet here’s a spot .
Hark She speaks . I will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
Out , damned spot Out , I say One , two . Why , then , ’tis time to do ’t . Hell is murky Fie , my lord , fie A soldier , and afeard What need we fear who knows it , when none can call our power to account Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him .
Do you mark that
The thane of Fife had a wife . Where is she now What , will these hands ne er be clean No more o that , my lord , no more o that . You mar all with this starting .
Go to , go to . You have known what you should not .
Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus , When grief and blood ill tempered vexeth him
When I spoke that , I was ill tempered too .
Do you confess so much Give me your hand .
And my heart too .
O Brutus
What’s the matter
Have not you love enough to bear with me , When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful
Yes , Cassius . And from henceforth When you are over earnest with your Brutus , He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so .
Let me go in to see the generals . There is some grudge between em . Tis not meet They be alone .
You shall not come to them .
Nothing but death shall stay me .
Thus far with rough and all unable pen Our bending author hath pursued the story , In little room confining mighty men , Mangling by starts the full course of their glory . Small time , but in that small most greatly lived This star of England . Fortune made his sword , By which the world’s best garden be achieved And of it left his son imperial lord . Henry the Sixth , in infant bands crowned king Of France and England , did this king succeed , Whose state so many had the managing That they lost France and made his England bleed , Which oft our stage hath shown . And for their sake , In your fair minds let this acceptance take .
That art incestuous . Caitiff , to pieces shake , That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practiced on man’s life . Close pent up guilts , Rive your concealing continents and cry These dreadful summoners grace . I am a man More sinned against than sinning .
Your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations . Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold , silver , and lead , whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you , will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love . But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come
He’s in the right . Constable , what say you to it
Alack , bareheaded Gracious my lord , hard by here is a hovel . Some friendship will it lend you gainst the tempest . Repose you there , while I to this hard house More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised , Which even but now , demanding after you , Denied me to come in return , and force Their scanted courtesy .
I pray thee , overname them . And as thou namest them , I will describe them . And according to my description , level at my affection .
First , an it like you , the house is a respected house next , this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected woman .
My wits begin to turn . Where is this straw , my fellow The art of our necessities is strange That can make vile things precious . Come , your hovel . Poor fool and knave , I have one part in my heart That’s sorry yet for thee .
First , there is the Neapolitan prince .
By this hand , sir , his wife is a more respected person than any of us all .
Ay , that’s a colt indeed , for he doth nothing but talk of his horse , and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself . I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith .
Then there is the County Palatine .
How long is that since
He that has and a little tiny wit With heigh ho , the wind and the rain Must make content with his fortunes fit , For the rain it raineth every day .
True , my good boy . Come , bring us to this hovel .
Varlet , thou liest thou liest , wicked varlet The time has yet to come that she was ever respected with man , woman , or child .
He doth nothing but frown , as who should say , An you will not have me , choose . He hears merry tales and smiles not . I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth . I had rather be married to a death’s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these . God defend me from these two
Cannot you tell that Every fool can tell that . It was the very day that young Hamlet was born , he that is mad and sent into England .
How say you by the French lord , Monsieur le Bon
Sir , she was respected with him before he married with her .
Which is the wiser here Justice or Iniquity Is this true
She has spoke what she should not , I am sure of that . Heaven knows what she has known .
Ay , marry , why was he sent into England
Well , and say that Martius Return me , as Cominius is return’d , Unheard what then But as a discontented friend , grief shot With his unkindness say’t be so
Why , because he was mad . He shall recover his wits there , or , if he do not , it’s no great matter there .
How now What’s the matter
For shame , you generals What do you mean Love , and be friends as two such men should be . For I have seen more years , I’m sure , than ye .
Ha , ha , how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
Get you hence , sirrah . Saucy fellow , hence
Bear with him , Brutus . Tis his fashion .
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time . What should the wars do with these jigging fools Companion , hence
Away , away , be gone .
Lucillius and Titinius , bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight .
And come yourselves , and bring Messala with you , Immediately to us .
Lucius , a bowl of wine
I did not think you could have been so angry .
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome , after the measure As you intended well .
I’ll undertake ’t I think he’ll hear me . Yet , to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius , much unhearts me . He was not taken well he had not dined The veins unfill’d , our blood is cold , and then We pout upon the morning , are unapt To give or to forgive but when we have stuff’d These and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding , we have suppler souls Than in our priest like fasts therefore I’ll watch him Till he be dieted to my request , And then I’ll set upon him .
You know the very road into his kindness , And cannot lose your way .
Good faith , I’ll prove him , Speed how it will . I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success .
O thou caitiff O thou varlet O thou wicked Hannibal I respected with her before I was married to her If ever I was respected with her , or she with me , let not your worship think me the poor duke’s officer . Prove this , thou wicked Hannibal , or I’ll have mine action of battery on thee .
Here’s the smell of the blood still . All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . Oh , Oh , Oh
If he took you a box o’ the ear , you might have your action of slander too .
What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged .
Marry , I thank your good worship for it . What is’t your worship’s pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
Well , well , well .
Truly , officer , because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst , let him continue in his courses till thou knowest what they are .
Pray God it be , sir .
This disease is beyond my practice . Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
Wash your hands . Put on your nightgown . Look not so pale . I tell you yet again , Banquo’s buried he cannot come out on ’s grave .
Even so
To bed , to bed . There’s knocking at the gate . Come , come , come , come . Give me your hand . What’s done cannot be undone . To bed , to bed , to bed
Will she go now to bed
Why
Twill not be seen in him there . There the men are as mad as he .
How came he mad
Very strangely , they say .
How strangely
Faith , e en with losing his wits .
Upon what ground
Why , here in Denmark . I have been sexton here , man and boy , thirty years .
How long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot
This is a brave night to cool a courtesan . I’ll speak a prophecy ere I go . When priests are more in word than matter , When brewers mar their malt with water , When nobles are their tailors tutors , No heretics burned but wenches suitors , When every case in law is right , No squire in debt nor no poor knight , When slanders do not live in tongues , Nor cutpurses come not to throngs , When usurers tell their gold i th field , And bawds and whores do churches build Then shall the realm of Albion Come to great confusion . Then comes the time , who lives to see ’t , That going shall be used with feet . This prophecy Merlin shall make , for I live before his time .
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man . In truth , I know it is a sin to be a mocker , but he why , he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s , a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine . He is every man in no man . If a throstle sing , he falls straight a capering . He will fence with his own shadow . If I should marry him , I should marry twenty husbands . If he would despise me I would forgive him , for if he love me to madness I shall never requite him .
What say you then to Falconbridge , the young baron of England
You know I say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor I him . He hath neither Latin , French , nor Italian , and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English . He is a proper man’s picture , but alas , who can converse with a dumb show How oddly he is suited I think he bought his doublet in Italy , his round hose in France , his bonnet in Germany , and his behavior everywhere .
What think you of the Scottish lord , his neighbor
That he hath a neighborly charity in him , for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able . I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another .
He’ll never hear him .
Not
I tell you , he does sit in gold , his eye Red as ’twould burn Rome and his injury The gaoler to his pity . I kneel’d before him ’Twas very faintly he said ‘Rise ’ dismiss’d me Thus , with his speechless hand what he would do , He sent in writing after me what he would not , Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions So that all hope is vain . Unless his noble mother , and his wife Who , as I hear , mean to solicit him For mercy to his country . Therefore , let’s hence , And with our fair entreaties haste them on .
Marry , I thank your worship for it . Thou seest , thou wicked varlet , now , what’s come upon thee thou art to continue now , thou varlet thou art to continue .
Where were you born , friend
Here in Vienna , sir .
Are you of fourscore pounds a year
Yes , an’t please you , sir .
So . What trade are you of , sir
Tapster a poor widow’s tapster .
Your mistress’ name
Mistress Overdone .
Directly .
Hath she had any more than one husband
Nine , sir Overdone by the last .
Foul whisp rings are abroad . Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles . Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets . More needs she the divine than the physician . God , God forgive us all Look after her , Remove from her the means of all annoyance , And still keep eyes upon her . So , good night . My mind she has mated , and amazed my sight . I think , but dare not speak .
Good night , good doctor .
Nine Come hither to me , Master Froth . Master Froth , I would not have you acquainted with tapsters they will draw you , Master Froth , and you will hang them . Get you gone , and let me hear no more of you .
Alack , alack , Edmund , I like not this unnatural dealing . When I desire their leave that I might pity him , they took from me the use of mine own house , charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him , entreat for him , nor any way sustain him .
I thank your worship . For mine own part , I never come into any room in a tap house , but I am drawn in .
Most savage and unnatural
Well , no more of it , Master Froth farewell .
Go to , say you nothing . There’s a division betwixt the dukes . And a worse matter than that I have received a letter this night . Tis dangerous to be spoken . I have locked the letter in my closet . These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home . There’s part of a power already footed . We must incline to the king . I will look him and privily relieve him . Go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived . If he ask for me , I am ill and gone to bed . Though I die for it as no less is threatened me the king my old master must be relieved . There is some strange thing toward , Edmund . Pray you , be careful .
This courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke Instantly know , and of that letter too . This seems a fair deserving , and must draw me That which my father loses no less than all . The younger rises when the old doth fall .
Now , fair Hippolyta , our nuptial hour Draws on apace . Four happy days bring in Another moon . But oh , methinks how slow This old moon wanes She lingers my desires , Like to a stepdame or a dowager Long withering out a young man’s revenue .
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night . Four nights will quickly dream away the time . And then the moon , like to a silver bow New bent in heaven , shall behold the night Of our solemnities .
Go , Philostrate , Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments . Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth . Turn melancholy forth to funerals . The pale companion is not for our pomp .
Hippolyta , I wooed thee with my sword And won thy love doing thee injuries . But I will wed thee in another key , With pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
Happy be Theseus , our renownèd duke .
O Cassius , I am sick of many griefs .
Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils .
No man bears sorrow better . Portia is dead .
Ha , Portia
She is dead .
How ’scaped I killing when I crossed you so O insupportable and touching loss Upon what sickness
Impatient of my absence , And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong for with her death That tidings came with this she fell distract And , her attendants absent , swallowed fire .
And died so
Even so .
O ye immortal gods
Faith , if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year . A tanner will last you nine year .
Why he more than another
Why , sir , his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while , and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body . Here’s a skull now . This skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years .
Whose was it
A whoreson mad fellow’s it was . Whose do you think it was
Nay , I know not .
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once . This same skull , sir , was Yorick’s skull , the king’s jester .
This
E en that .
Let me see . Alas , poor Yorick I knew him , Horatio , a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy . He hath borne me on his back a thousand times , and now , how abhorred in my imagination it is My gorge rises at it . Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft . Where be your gibes now Your gambols Your songs Your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your own grinning Quite chapfallen Now get you to my lady’s chamber and tell her , let her paint an inch thick , to this favor she must come . Make her laugh at that . Prithee , Horatio , tell me one thing .
Here is the place , my lord . Good my lord , enter . The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure .
Let me alone .
Good my lord , enter here .
Wilt break my heart
I had rather break mine own . Good my lord , enter .
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin . So ’tis to thee . But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt . Thou’dst shun a bear , But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea Thou’dst meet the bear i th mouth . When the mind’s free , The body’s delicate . The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there filial ingratitude . Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t But I will punish home . No , I will weep no more . In such a night To shut me out Pour on , I will endure . In such a night as this O Regan , Goneril , Your old kind father , whose frank heart gave all Oh , that way madness lies . Let me shun that . No more of that .
Speak no more of her . Give me a bowl of wine . In this I bury all unkindness , Cassius .
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge . Fill , Lucius , till the wine o erswell the cup . I cannot drink too much of Brutus love .
Come in , Titinius . Welcome , good Messala Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities .
Portia , art thou gone
No more , I pray you . Messala , I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power , Bending their expedition toward Philippi .
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
With what addition
That by proscription and bills of outlawry , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators .
What’s that , my lord
Dost thou think Alexander looked o this fashion i th earth
E en so .
And smelt so Pah
E en so , my lord .
To what base uses we may return , Horatio . Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole
Twere to consider too curiously , to consider so .
No , faith , not a jot . But to follow him thither with modesty enough , and likelihood to lead it , as thus Alexander died , Alexander was buried , Alexander returneth to dust , the dust is earth , of earth we make loam and why of that loam , whereto he was converted , might they not stop a beer barrel Imperious Caesar , dead and turned to clay , Might stop a hole to keep the wind away . Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a wall t expel the winter’s flaw But soft , but soft a while .
Here comes the king , The queen , the courtiers who is this they follow , And with such maimèd rites This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life . Twas of some estate . Couch we a while and mark .
The English power is near , led on by Malcolm , His uncle Siward and the good Macduff . Revenges burn in them , for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man .
Near Birnam Wood Shall we well meet them that way are they coming .
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
For certain , sir , he is not . I have a file Of all the gentry . There is Siward’s son , And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood .
What does the tyrant
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies . Some say he’s mad , others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury . But , for certain , He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule .
Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands . Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach . Those he commands move only in command , Nothing in love . Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him , like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief .
Good my lord , enter here .
Prithee , go in thyself . Seek thine own ease . This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more . But I’ll go in . In , boy . Go first . You houseless poverty Nay , get thee in . I’ll pray , and then I’ll sleep .
Poor naked wretches , whereso er you are , That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm , How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides , Your looped and windowed raggedness , defend you From seasons such as these Oh , I have ta en Too little care of this Take physic , pomp . Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just .
Fathom and half , fathom and half Poor Tom
Therein our letters do not well agree . Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions , Cicero being one .
Cicero one
Cicero is dead , And by that order of proscription . Had you your letters from your wife , my lord
No , Messala .
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
Nothing , Messala .
That methinks is strange .
Why ask you Hear you aught of her in yours
No , my lord .
Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true .
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell . For certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
Why , farewell , Portia . We must die , Messala . With meditating that she must die once , I have the patience to endure it now .
Even so great men great losses should endure .
How like you the young German , the Duke of Saxony’s nephew
Very vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk . When he is best he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast . And the worst fall that ever fell , I hope I shall make shift to go without him .
Come not in here , nuncle . Here’s a spirit . Help me , help me
Give me thy hand . Who’s there
Thanks , good Egeus . What’s the news with thee
A spirit , a spirit . He says his name’s Poor Tom .
What art thou that dost grumble there i th straw Come forth .
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child , my daughter Hermia . Stand forth , Demetrius . My noble lord , This man hath my consent to marry her . Stand forth , Lysander . And my gracious duke , This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child . Thou , thou , Lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , And interchanged love tokens with my child . Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love , And stol n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , Knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth . With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart , Turned her obedience To stubborn harshness . And , my gracious duke , Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius , I beg the ancient privilege of Athens . As she is mine , I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that case .
What say you , Hermia Be advised , fair maid To you your father should be as a god , One that composed your beauties , yea , and one To whom you are but as a form in wax , By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it . Demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket , you should refuse to perform your father’s will if you should refuse to accept him .
Therefore , for fear of the worst , I pray thee , set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket , for if the devil be within and that temptation without , I know he will choose it . I will do any thing , Nerissa , ere I’ll be married to a sponge .
You need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords . They have acquainted me with their determinations , which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets .
If I live to be as old as Sibylla , I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will . I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable , for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence . And I pray God grant them a fair departure .
Do you not remember , lady , in your father’s time a Venetian , a scholar and a soldier , that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat
Stay whence are you
Stand , and go back .
You guard like men ’tis well but , by your leave , I am an officer of state , and come To speak with Coriolanus .
From whence
From Rome .
You may not pass , you must return our general Will no more hear from thence .
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start , When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there
You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before You’ll speak with Coriolanus .
Well , march we on , To give obedience where ’tis truly owed . Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal , And with him pour we in our country’s purge Each drop of us .
Good my friends , If you have heard your general talk of Rome , And of his friends there , it is lots to blanks , My name hath touch’d your ears . It is Menenius .
Or so much as it needs , To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds . Make we our march towards Birnam .
Be it so go back the virtue of your name Is not here passable .
I tell thee , fellow , The general is my lover I have been The book of his good acts , whence men have read His name unparallel’d , haply amplified For I have ever verified my friends , Of whom he’s chief , with all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer nay , sometimes , Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground , I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise Have almost stamp’d the leasing therefore , fellow , I must have leave to pass .
What ceremony else
That is Laertes , a very noble youth , mark .
What ceremony else
Come you hither to me , Master tapster . What’s your name , Master tapster
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty . Her death was doubtful , And , but that great command o ersways the order , She should in ground unsanctified have lodged Till the last trumpet . For charitable prayers Shards , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her . Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants , Her maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of bell and burial .
Pompey .
Must there no more be done
What else
No more be done . We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace parted souls .
Bum , sir .
Lay her i th earth , And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring I tell thee , churlish priest , A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling .
Troth , and your bum is the greatest thing about you so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the Great . Pompey , you are partly a bawd , Pompey , howsoever you colour it in being a tapster , are you not come , tell me true it shall be the better for you .
What , the fair Ophelia
Truly , sir , I am a poor fellow that would live .
How would you live , Pompey by being a bawd What do you think of the trade , Pompey is it a lawful trade
If the law would allow it , sir .
But the law will not allow it , Pompey nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna .
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city
No , Pompey .
Truly , sir , in my poor opinion , they will to’t then . If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves , you need not to fear the bawds .
There are pretty orders beginning , I can tell you it is but heading and hanging .
I have as much of this in art as you , But yet my nature could not bear it so .
Well , to our work alive . What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently
I do not think it good .
Your reason
This it is Tis better that the enemy seek us . So shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , Doing himself offense , whilst we , lying still , Are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness .
Good reasons must of force give place to better . The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection , For they have grudged us contribution . The enemy , marching along by them , By them shall make a fuller number up , Come on refreshed , new added , and encouraged , From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there , These people at our back .
Hear me , good brother
Under your pardon . You must note beside , That we have tried the utmost of our friends , Our legions are brim full , our cause is ripe . The enemy increaseth every day . We , at the height , are ready to decline . There is a tide in the affairs of men , Which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune Omitted , all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries . On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures .
Bring me no more reports . Let them fly all . Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear . What’s the boy Malcolm Was he not born of woman The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus Fear not , Macbeth . No man that’s born of woman Shall e er have power upon thee . Then fly , false thanes , And mingle with the English epicures . The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear .
The devil damn thee black , thou cream faced loon Where got’st thou that goose look
There is ten thousand
Geese , villain
Soldiers , sir .
Go , prick thy face and over red thy fear , Thou lily livered boy . What soldiers , patch Death of thy soul Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear . What soldiers , whey face
The English force , so please you .
Take thy face hence .
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together , you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads if this law hold in Vienna ten year , I’ll rent the fairest house in it after three pence a bay if you live to see this come to pass , say Pompey told you so .
Thank you , good Pompey and , in requital of your prophecy , hark you I advise you , let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever no , not for dwelling where you do if I do , Pompey , I shall beat you to your tent , and prove a shrewd Caesar to you in plain dealing , Pompey , I shall have you whipt so , for this time , Pompey , fare you well .
I thank your worship for your good counsel
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine . Whip me No , no let carman whip his jade The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade .
Come hither to me , Master Elbow come hither , master constable . How long have you been in this place of constable
Seven year and a half , sir .
Sweets to the sweet . Farewell I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife . I thought thy bride bed to have decked , sweet maid , And not have strewed thy grave .
Oh , treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head , Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms .
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead , Till of this flat a mountain you have made , T o ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus .

The devil take thy soul
Thou pray’st not well . I prithee , take thy fingers from my throat , For though I am not splenitive and rash , Yet have I something in me dangerous , Which let thy wisdom fear . Hold off thy hand .
Pluck them asunder .
Then , with your will , go on . We’ll along ourselves , and meet them at Philippi .
The deep of night is crept upon our talk , And nature must obey necessity , Which we will niggard with a little rest . There is no more to say
No more . Good night . Early tomorrow will we rise and hence .
Lucius
My gown .
Farewell , good Messala . Good night , Titinius . Noble , noble Cassius , Good night and good repose .
O my dear brother , This was an ill beginning of the night . Never come such division ’tween our souls . Let it not , Brutus .
Away The foul fiend follows me Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind . Hum Go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters , and art thou come to this
Who gives any thing to Poor Tom , whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame , through ford and whirlipool , o er bog and quagmire that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew , set ratsbane by his porridge , made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting horse over four inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor Bless thy five wits . Tom’s a cold . Oh , do de , do de , do de . Bless thee from whirlwinds , star blasting , and taking Do Poor Tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes . There could I have him now and there and there again and there .
What , has his daughters brought him to this pass Couldst thou save nothing Wouldst thou give em all
Nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o er men’s faults light on thy daughters
He hath no daughters , sir .
Seyton I am sick at heart , When I behold Seyton , I say This push Will cheer me ever , or disseat me now . I have lived long enough . My way of life Is fall n into the sere , the yellow leaf , And that which should accompany old age , As honor , love , obedience , troops of friends , I must not look to have , but , in their stead , Curses , not loud but deep , mouth honor , breath Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not . Seyton
What’s your gracious pleasure
What news more
All is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked . Give me my armor .
Tis not needed yet .
I’ll put it on . Send out more horses . Skirr the country round . Hang those that talk of fear . Give me mine armor . How does your patient , doctor
Not so sick , my lord , As she is troubled with thick coming fancies That keep her from her rest .
Yes , yes , it was Bassanio as I think he was so called .
True , madam . He , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .
I remember him well , and I remember him worthy of thy praise .
How now , what news
The four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave . And there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the Prince of Morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell , I should be glad of his approach . If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , I had rather he should shrive me than wive me . Come , Nerissa . Sirrah , go before . Whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer Another knocks at the door .
So is Lysander .
In himself he is . But in this kind , wanting your father’s voice , The other must be held the worthier .
I would my father looked but with my eyes .
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
I do entreat your grace to pardon me . I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts , But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case , If I refuse to wed Demetrius .
I thought , by your readiness in the office , you had continued in it some time . You say , seven years together
Either to die the death or to abjure Forever the society of men . Therefore , fair Hermia , question your desires . Know of your youth . Examine well your blood Whether , if you yield not to your father’s choice , You can endure the livery of a nun , For aye to be in shady cloister mewed , To live a barren sister all your life , Chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . Thrice blessèd they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage . But earthlier happy is the rose distilled Than that which , withering on the virgin thorn , Grows , lives , and dies in single blessedness .
And a half , sir .
Alas , it hath been great pains to you . They do you wrong to put you so oft upon ’t are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it
Faith , sir , few of any wit in such matters as they are chosen , they are glad to choose me for them I do it for some piece of money , and go through with all .
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven , the most sufficient of your parish .
To your worship’s house , sir
To my house . Fare you well .
What’s o’clock , think you
Eleven , sir .
I pray you home to dinner with me .
I humbly thank you .
It grieves me for the death of Claudio But there’s no remedy .
Lord Angelo is severe .
It is but needful Mercy is not itself , that oft looks so Pardon is still the nurse of second woe But yet , poor Claudio There is no remedy . Come , sir .
Everything is well .
Good night , my lord .
Good night , good brother .
Good night , Lord Brutus .
Farewell , everyone .
Give me the gown . Where is thy instrument
Here in the tent .
What , thou speak’st drowsily Poor knave , I blame thee not . Thou art o erwatched . Call Claudio and some other of my men . I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
Varrus and Claudio
Calls my lord
I pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep . It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius .
Hamlet , Hamlet
So please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
Gentlemen
Good my lord , be quiet .
Why , I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag .
O my son , what theme
I loved Ophelia . Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum . What wilt thou do for her
O , he is mad , Laertes .
For love of God , forbear him .
Swounds , show me what thou lt do . Woo’t weep Woo’t fight Woo’t fast Woo’t tear thyself Woo’t drink up eisel , eat a crocodile I’ll do ’t . Dost thou come here to whine , To outface me with leaping in her grave Be buried quick with her and so will I . And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us , till our ground , Singeing his pate against the burning zone , Make Ossa like a wart Nay , an thou lt mouth , I’ll rant as well as thou .
This is mere madness . And thus a while the fit will work on him . Anon , as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed , His silence will sit drooping .
Faith , sir , if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own , you should not pass here no , though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely . Therefore , go back .
Prithee , fellow , remember my name is Menenius , always factionary on the party of your general .
Howsoever you have been his liar , as you say you have , I am one that , telling true under him , must say , you cannot pass . Therefore , go back .
Has he dined , canst thou tell for I would not speak with him till after dinner .
You are a Roman , are you
I am , as thy general is .
Then you should hate Rome , as he does . Can you , when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them , and , in a violent popular ignorance , given your enemy your shield , think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women , the virginal palms of your daughters , or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in , with such weak breath as this No , you are deceived therefore , back to Rome , and prepare for your execution you are condemned , our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon .
Cure her of that . Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased , Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow , Raze out the written troubles of the brain And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart
Therein the patient Must minister to himself .
Throw physic to the dogs I’ll none of it . Come , put mine armor on . Give me my staff . Seyton , send out . Doctor , the thanes fly from me . Come , sir , dispatch . If thou couldst , doctor , cast The water of my land , find her disease , And purge it to a sound and pristine health , I would applaud thee to the very echo , That should applaud again . Pull ’t off , I say . What rhubarb , senna , or what purgative drug , Would scour these English hence Hear’st thou of them
Ay , my good lord . Your royal preparation Makes us hear something .
Bring it after me . I will not be afraid of death and bane , Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane .
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear , Profit again should hardly draw me here .
I will not have it so . Lie down , good sirs . It may be I shall otherwise bethink me . Look , Lucius , here’s the book I sought for so . I put it in the pocket of my gown .
I was sure your lordship did not give it me .
Bear with me , good boy , I am much forgetful . Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , And touch thy instrument a strain or two
Ay , my lord , an ’t please you .
It does , my boy . I trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
It is my duty , sir .
I should not urge thy duty past thy might . I know young bloods look for a time of rest .
I have slept , my lord , already .
It was well done , and thou shalt sleep again . I will not hold thee long . If I do live , I will be good to thee .
This is a sleepy tune . O murderous slumber , Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music Gentle knave , good night . I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee . If thou dost nod , thou break’st thy instrument . I’ll take it from thee . And , good boy , good night . Let me see , let me see . Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading Here it is , I think .
Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe .
Death , traitor Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters . Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh Judicious punishment Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters .
We doubt it nothing .
Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill . Alow , alow , loo , loo
What wood is this before us
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .
The wood of Birnam .
Take heed o th foul fiend . Obey thy parents , keep thy word’s justice , swear not , commit not with man’s sworn spouse , set not thy sweet heart on proud array . Tom’s a cold .
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him . Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us .
What hast thou been
It shall be done .
A servingman , proud in heart and mind , that curled my hair , wore gloves in my cap , served the lust of my mistress heart and did the act of darkness with her , swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it . Wine loved I deeply , dice dearly , and in woman outparamoured the Turk . False of heart , light of ear , bloody of hand hog in sloth , fox in stealth , wolf in greediness , dog in madness , lion in prey . Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman . Keep thy foot out of brothels , thy hand out of plackets , thy pen from lenders books , and defy the foul fiend . Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind , says , Suum , mun , nonny . Dauphin my boy , my boy , cessez . Let him trot by .
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t .
Tis his main hope For , where there is advantage to be given , Both more and less have given him the revolt , And none serve with him but constrainèd things Whose hearts are absent too .
Let our just censures Attend the true event , and put we on Industrious soldiership .
Hear you , sir . What is the reason that you use me thus I loved you ever . But it is no matter . Let Hercules himself do what he may , The cat will mew and dog will have his day .
I pray thee , good Horatio , wait upon him .
Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech . We’ll put the matter to the present push . Good Gertrude , set some watch over your son . This grave shall have a living monument . An hour of quiet shortly shall we see . Till then in patience our proceeding be .
How ill this taper burns Ha , who comes here I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition . It comes upon me . Art thou any thing Art thou some god , some angel , or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare Speak to me what thou art .
Thy evil spirit , Brutus .
Why comest thou
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi .
Well , then I shall see thee again
Ay , at Philippi .
Why , I will see thee at Philippi , then .
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest . Ill spirit , I would hold more talk with thee . Boy , Lucius Varrus Claudio Sirs , awake Claudio
Three thousand ducats , well .
The strings , my lord , are false .
Ay , sir , for three months .
For three months , well .
So will I grow , so live , so die , my lord , Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship , whose unwishèd yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty .
For the which , as I told you , Antonio shall be bound .
Antonio shall become bound , well .
May you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your answer
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio bound .
Your answer to that
Antonio is a good man .
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary
Ho , no , no , no , no . My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient . Yet his means are in supposition . He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis , another to the Indies . I understand moreover , upon the Rialto , he hath a third at Mexico , a fourth for England , and other ventures he hath squandered abroad .
He’s hearing of a cause he will come straight I’ll tell him of you .
Pray you , do .
I’ll know His pleasure may be he will relent . Alas , He hath but as offended in a dream All sects , all ages smack of this vice and he To die for’t
Now , what’s the matter . Provost
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow
Did not I tell thee yea Hadst thou not order Why dost thou ask again
Lest I might be too rash Under your good correction , I have seen , When , after execution , judgment hath Repented o’er his doom .
Go to let that be mine Do you your office , or give up your place , And you shall well be spared .
So much for this , sir . Now shall you see the other . You do remember all the circumstance
Remember it , my lord
Sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep . Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes . Rashly And praised be rashness for it let us know Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well When our deep plots do pall , and that should teach us There’s a divinity that shapes our ends , Rough hew them how we will
That is most certain .
Up from my cabin , My sea gown scarfed about me , in the dark Groped I to find out them , had my desire , Fingered their packet , and in fine withdrew To mine own room again , making so bold My head should be struck off .
Take time to pause , and by the next new moon The sealing day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father’s will , Or else to wed Demetrius , as he would , Or on Diana’s altar to protest For aye austerity and single life .
Relent , sweet Hermia And , Lysander , yield Thy crazèd title to my certain right .
You have her father’s love , Demetrius . Let me have Hermia’s . Do you marry him .
Scornful Lysander , true , he hath my love , And what is mine my love shall render him . And she is mine , and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius .
as Demetrius . And which is more than all these boasts can be I am beloved of beauteous Hermia . Why should not I then prosecute my right Demetrius , I’ll avouch it to his head , Made love to Nedar’s daughter , Helena , And won her soul . And she , sweet lady , dotes , Devoutly dotes , dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant man .
The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe . Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate , But certain issue strokes must arbitrate . Towards which , advance the war .
Why , thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies . Is man no more than this Consider him well . Thou owest the worm no silk , the beast no hide , the sheep no wool , the cat no perfume . Ha Here’s three on ’s are sophisticated . Thou art the thing itself . Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor , bare , forked animal as thou art . Off , off , you lendings Come . Unbutton here .
Prithee , nuncle , be contented . Tis a naughty night to swim in . Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart a small spark , all the rest on ’s body cold . Look , here comes a walking fire .
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet . He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock . He gives the web and the pin , squints the eye and makes the harelip , mildews the white wheat and hurts the poor creature of earth . Swithold footed thrice the old . He met the nightmare and her ninefold , Bid her alight , And her troth plight . And aroint thee , witch , aroint thee
How fares your grace
What’s he
Who’s there What is ’t you seek
He thinks he still is at his instrument . Lucius , awake .
My lord
Didst thou dream , Lucius , that thou so criedst out
My lord , I do not know that I did cry .
Yes , that thou didst . Didst thou see any thing
Nothing , my lord .
Sleep again , Lucius . Sirrah Claudio Fellow thou , awake
My lord
My lord
Why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep
Did we , my lord
Ay . Saw you anything
No , my lord , I saw nothing .
Nor I , my lord .
Sirrah , if thy captain knew I were here , he would use me with estimation .
Come , my captain knows you not .
I mean , thy general .
My general cares not for you . Back , I say , go lest I let forth your half pint of blood back , that’s the utmost of your having back .
Nay , but , fellow , fellow ,
What’s the matter
Now , you companion , I’ll say an errand for you You shall know now that I am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus guess , but by my entertainment with him , if thou standest not i’ the state of hanging , or of some death more long in spectatorship , and crueller in suffering behold now presently , and swoon for what’s to come upon thee .
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity , and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does O my son , my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee , here’s water to quench it . I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee , I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome , and thy petitionary countrymen . The good gods assuage thy wrath , and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here , this , who , like a block , hath denied my access to thee .
I crave your honour’s pardon . What shall be done , sir , with the groaning Juliet She’s very near her hour .
Dispose of her To some more fitter place , and that with speed .
Here is the sister of the man condemn’d Desires access to you .
Hath he a sister
Ay , my good lord a very virtuous maid , And to be shortly of a sisterhood , If not already .
Well , let her be admitted .
See you the fornicatress be removed Let have needful , but not lavish , means There shall be order for’t .
God save your honour
Stay a little while .
You’re welcome what’s your will
I am a woeful suitor to your honour , Please but your honour hear me .
Hang out our banners on the outward walls . The cry is still They come Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn . Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up . Were they not forced with those that should be ours , We might have met them dareful , beard to beard , And beat them backward home .
What is that noise
It is the cry of women , my good lord .
I have almost forgot the taste of fears . The time has been my senses would have cooled To hear a night shriek , and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in ’t . I have supped full with horrors . Direness , familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me .
Wherefore was that cry
The queen , my lord , is dead .
What are you there Your names
Poor Tom , that eats the swimming frog , the toad , the tadpole , the wall newt , and the water that in the fury of his heart , when the foul fiend rages , eats cow dung for salads , swallows the old rat and the ditch dog , drinks the green mantle of the standing pool who is whipped from tithing to tithing and stocked , punished and imprisoned who hath had three suits to his back , six shirts to his body , Horse to ride and weapon to wear . But mice and rats and such small deer Have been Tom’s food for seven long year . Beware my follower . Peace , Smulkin . Peace , thou fiend
What , hath your grace no better company
The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman . Modo he’s called , and Mahu .
Our flesh and blood , my lord , is grown so vile That it doth hate what gets it .
Poor Tom’s a cold .
Go in with me . My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters hard commands . Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you , Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready .
First let me talk with this philosopher . What is the cause of thunder
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius . Bid him set on his powers betimes before , And we will follow .
It shall be done , my lord .
I must confess that I have heard so much And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof , But being overfull of self affairs , My mind did lose it . But , Demetrius , come . And come , Egeus . You shall go with me . I have some private schooling for you both . For you , fair Hermia , look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father’s will , Or else the law of Athens yields you up To death , or to a vow of single life . Come , my Hippolyta . What cheer , my love Demetrius and Egeus , go along . I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves .
With duty and desire we follow you .
How now , my love Why is your cheek so pale How chance the roses there do fade so fast
Belike for want of rain , which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
Ay me For aught that I could ever read , Could ever hear by tale or history , The course of true love never did run smooth . But either it was different in blood
Is ’t possible
Here’s the commission . Read it at more leisure . But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed
I beseech you .
Being thus benetted round with villainies Ere I could make a prologue to my brains , They had begun the play I sat me down , Devised a new commission , wrote it fair . I once did hold it , as our statists do , A baseness to write fair , and labored much How to forget that learning , but , sir , now It did me yeoman’s service . Wilt thou know Th effect of what I wrote
Ay , good my lord .
An earnest conjuration from the king , As England was his faithful tributary , As love between them like the palm might flourish , As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma ’tween their amities , And many suchlike as’s of great charge , That , on the view and knowing of these contents , Without debatement further , more or less , He should the bearers put to sudden death , Not shriving time allowed .
How was this sealed
Away
How away
Wife , mother , child , I know not . My affairs Are servanted to others though I owe My revenge properly , my remission lies In Volscian breasts . That we have been familiar , Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison , rather Than pity note how much . Therefore , be gone . Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force . Yet , for I loved thee , Take this along I writ it for thy sake
And would have rent it . Another word , Menenius , I will not hear thee speak . This man , Aufidius , Was my beloved in Rome yet thou behold’st
You keep a constant temper .
Now , sir , is your name Menenius
’Tis a spell , you see , of much power you know the way home again .
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back
What cause , do you think , I have to swoon
Well what’s your suit
There is a vice that most I do abhor , And most desire should meet the blow of justice For which I would not plead , but that I must For which I must not plead , but that I am At war ’twixt will and will not .
Well the matter
I have a brother is condemn’d to die I do beseech you , let it be his fault , And not my brother .
Heaven give thee moving graces
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it Why , every fault’s condemn’d ere it be done Mine were the very cipher of a function , To fine the faults whose fine stands in record , And let go by the actor .
O just but severe law I had a brother , then . Heaven keep your honour
Give’t not o’er so to him again , entreat him Kneel down before him , hang upon his gown You are too cold if you should need a pin , You could not with more tame a tongue desire it To him , I say
She should have died hereafter . There would have been a time for such a word . Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time , And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death . Out , out , brief candle Life’s but a walking shadow , a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more . It is a tale Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , Signifying nothing .
Thou comest to use Thy tongue thy story quickly .
Gracious my lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to do ’t .
Well , say , sir .
As I did stand my watch upon the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and anon methought The wood began to move .
Liar and slave
Let me endure your wrath , if ’t be not so . Within this three mile may you see it coming I say , a moving grove .
Good my lord , take his offer . Go into the house .
I’ll talk a word with this same learnèd Theban . What is your study
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin .
Let me ask you one word in private .
Importune him once more to go , my lord . His wits begin t unsettle .
Now , Antony , our hopes are answerèd . You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions . It proves not so . Their battles are at hand . They mean to warn us at Philippi here , Answering before we do demand of them .
Canst thou blame him
Tut , I am in their bosoms , and I know Wherefore they do it . They could be content To visit other places , and come down With fearful bravery , thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage . But ’tis not so .
His daughters seek his death . Ah , that good Kent He said it would be thus , poor banished man . Thou say’st the king grows mad . I’ll tell thee , friend , I am almost mad myself . I had a son , Now outlawed from my blood . He sought my life , But lately , very late . I loved him , friend No father his son dearer . Truth to tell thee ,
Prepare you , generals . The enemy comes on in gallant show . Their bloody sign of battle is hung out , And something to be done immediately .
Octavius , lead your battle softly on , Upon the left hand of the even field .
Upon the right hand I . Keep thou the left .
Why do you cross me in this exigent
But ships are but boards , sailors but men . There be land rats and water rats , water thieves and land thieves I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks . The man is notwithstanding sufficient .
Be assured you may .
I will be assured I may , and that I may be assured , I will bethink me . May I speak with Antonio
If it please you to dine with us .
Yes to smell pork , to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into . I will buy with you , sell with you , talk with you , walk with you , and so following , but I will not eat with you , drink with you , nor pray with you . What news on the Rialto Who is he comes here
This is Signor Antonio .
How like a fawning publican he looks I hate him for he is a Christian , But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice . If I can catch him once upon the hip , I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him . He hates our sacred nation , and he rails , Even there where merchants most do congregate , On me , my bargains and my well won thrift ,
O cross Too high to be enthralled to low .
Or else misgraffèd in respect of years
O spite Too old to be engaged to young .
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends
O hell , to choose love by another’s eyes
Or , if there were a sympathy in choice , War , death , or sickness did lay siege to it , Making it momentary as a sound , Swift as a shadow , short as any dream , Brief as the lightning in the collied night That , in a spleen , unfolds both heaven and Earth , And ere a man hath power to say Behold The jaws of darkness do devour it up . So quick bright things come to confusion .
If then true lovers have been ever crossed , It stands as an edict in destiny . Then let us teach our trial patience , Because it is a customary cross , As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs , Wishes and tears , poor fancy’s followers .
A good persuasion . Therefore , hear me , Hermia . I have a widow aunt , a dowager Of great revenue , and she hath no child . From Athens is her house remote seven leagues , And she respects me as her only son . There , gentle Hermia , may I marry thee . And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us . If thou lovest me then , Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night . And in the wood , a league without the town
Must he needs die
Maiden , no remedy .
Yes I do think that you might pardon him , And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy .
I will not do’t .
But can you , if you would
Look , what I will not , that I cannot do .
But might you do’t , and do the world no wrong , If so your heart were touch’d with that remorse As mine is to him
He’s sentenced ’tis too late .
The grief hath crazed my wits . What a night’s this I do beseech your grace
You are too cold .
O , cry your mercy , sir . Noble philosopher , your company .
Tom’s a cold .
Too late why , no I , that do speak a word . May call it back again . Well , believe this , No ceremony that to great ones ’longs , Not the king’s crown , nor the deputed sword , The marshal’s truncheon , nor the judge’s robe , Become them with one half so good a grace As mercy does . If he had been as you and you as he , You would have slipt like him but he , like you , Would not have been so stern .
In , fellow . There , into th hovel . Keep thee warm .
Pray you , be gone .
Come let’s in all .
This way , my lord .
With him I will keep still with my philosopher .
Good my lord , soothe him . Let him take the fellow .
Take him you on .
Sirrah , come on . Go along with us .
Come , good Athenian .
No words , no words . Hush .
Child Roland to the dark tower came , His word was still Fie , foh , and fum , I smell the blood of a British man .
Why , even in that was heaven ordinant . I had my father’s signet in my purse , Which was the model of that Danish seal . Folded the writ up in form of th other , Subscribed it , gave ’t th impression , placed it safely , The changeling never known . Now , the next day Was our sea fight , and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already .
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t .
Why , man , they did make love to this employment . They are not near my conscience . Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow . Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites .
Why , what a king is this
Does it not , think thee , stand me now upon He that hath killed my king and whored my mother , Popped in between th election and my hopes , Thrown out his angle for my proper life is ’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there .
I do not cross you . But I will do so .
They stand and would have parley .
Stand fast , Titinius . We must out and talk .
Mark Antony , shall we give sign of battle
No , Caesar , we will answer on their charge . Make forth . The generals would have some words .
Stir not until the signal .
Words before blows . Is it so , countrymen
Not that we love words better , as you do .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
In your bad strokes , Brutus , you give good words . Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart , Crying Long live , hail , Caesar
Antony , The posture of your blows are yet unknown . But for your words , they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless .
If thou speak’st false , Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee . If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much . I pull in resolution and begin To doubt th equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth . Fear not , till Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane . Arm , arm , and out If this which he avouches does appear , There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here . I gin to be aweary of the sun , And wish th estate o th world were now undone . Ring the alarum bell Blow , wind Come , wrack At least we’ll die with harness on our back .
I would to heaven I had your potency , And you were Isabel should it then be thus No I would tell what ’twere to be a judge , And what a prisoner .
Ay , touch him there’s the vein .
Your brother is a forfeit of the law , And you but waste your words .
Alas , alas Why , all the souls that were forfeit once And He that might the vantage best have took Found out the remedy . How would you be , If He , which is the top of judgment , should But judge you as you are O , think on that And mercy then will breathe within your lips , Like man new made .
Be you content , fair maid It is the law , not I condemn your brother Were he my kinsman , brother , or my son , It should be thus with him he must die tomorrow .
To morrow O , that’s sudden Spare him , spare him He’s not prepared for death . Even for our kitchens We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven With less respect than we do minister To our gross selves Good , good my lord , bethink you Who is it that hath died for this offence There’s many have committed it .
Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May There will I stay for thee .
My good Lysander I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow , By his best arrow with the golden head , By the simplicity of Venus doves , By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves , And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen , By all the vows that ever men have broke , In that same place thou hast appointed me , Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee .
Keep promise , love . Look , here comes Helena .
Godspeed , fair Helena Whither away
Call you me fair That fair again unsay . Demetrius loves your fair . O happy fair Your eyes are lodestars , and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear . Sickness is catching . Oh , were favor so , Yours would I catch , fair Hermia , ere I go . My ear should catch your voice . My eye , your eye . My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody . Were the world mine , Demetrius being bated , The rest I’d give to be to you translated .
I neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you , I can scarce think there’s any , ye’re so slight . He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst . For you , be that you are , long and your misery increase with your age I say to you , as I was said to , Away
A noble fellow , I warrant him .
The worthy fellow is our general he’s the rock , the oak not to be wind shaken .
Not stingless too
Oh , yes , and soundless too . For you have stol n their buzzing , Antony , And very wisely threat before you sting .
Villains , you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar . You showed your teeth like apes , and fawned like hounds , And bowed like bondmen , kissing Caesar’s feet , Whilst damnèd Casca , like a cur , behind Struck Caesar on the neck . O you flatterers
Flatterers Now , Brutus , thank yourself . This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled .
Come , come , the cause . If arguing make us sweat , The proof of it will turn to redder drops . Look , I draw a sword against conspirators . When think you that the sword goes up again Never , till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged , or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .
Caesar , thou canst not die by traitors hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee .
So I hope . I was not born to die on Brutus sword .
O , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , Young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .
Ay , well said .
The law hath not been dead , though it hath slept Those many had not dared to do that evil , If the first that did the edict infringe Had answer’d for his deed now ’tis awake Takes note of what is done and , like a prophet , Looks in a glass , that shows what future evils , Either new , or by remissness new conceived , And so in progress to be hatch’d and born , Are now to have no successive degrees , But , ere they live , to end .
Yet show some pity .
Which he calls interest . Cursèd be my tribe If I forgive him
I show it most of all when I show justice For then I pity those I do not know , Which a dismiss’d offence would after gall And do him right that , answering one foul wrong , Lives not to act another . Be satisfied Your brother dies to morrow be content .
Shylock , do you hear
So you must be the first that gives this sentence , And he , that suffer’s . O , it is excellent To have a giant’s strength but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant .
I am debating of my present store , And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats . What of that Tubal , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe , Will furnish me . But soft How many months Do you desire Rest you fair , good signor . Your worship was the last man in our mouths .
That’s well said .
Shylock , albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess , Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend , I’ll break a custom . Is he yet possessed How much ye would
Ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
And for three months .
I had forgot three months . Well then , your bond , and let me see But hear you , Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage .
It will be short . The interim’s mine . And a man’s life’s no more than to say one . But I am very sorry , good Horatio , That to Laertes I forgot myself , For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his . I’ll court his favors . But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion .
Peace . Who comes here
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark .
I humbly thank you , sir . Dost know this water fly
No , my good lord .
Thy state is the more gracious , for ’tis a vice to know him . He hath much land , and fertile . Let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess . Tis a chough , but , as I say , spacious in the possession of dirt .
Sweet lord , if your lordship were at leisure , I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty .
I will receive it , sir , with all diligence of spirit . Put your bonnet to his right use . Tis for the head .
I thank your lordship . It is very hot .
Now near enough . Your leafy screens throw down , And show like those you are . You , worthy uncle , Shall , with my cousin , your right noble son , Lead our first battle . Worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do , According to our order .
O , teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius heart .
I frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
Oh , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
I give him curses , yet he gives me love .
Oh , that my prayers could such affection move
The more I hate , the more he follows me .
The more I love , the more he hateth me .
His folly , Helena , is no fault of mine .
None , but your beauty . Would that fault were mine
Take comfort . He no more shall see my face . Lysander and myself will fly this place . Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me . Oh , then , what graces in my love do dwell , That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell
Helen , to you our minds we will unfold . Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass , Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass , Through Athens gates have we devised to steal .
And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie , Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet ,
A peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , Joined with a masker and a reveler
Old Cassius still .
Come , Antony , away . Defiance , traitors , hurl we in your teeth . If you dare fight today , come to the field . If not , when you have stomachs .
Why , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark The storm is up and all is on the hazard .
Ho , Lucillius , hark , a word with you .
My lord
Messala
What says my general
Messala , This is my birthday , as this very day Was Cassius born . Give me thy hand , Messala . Be thou my witness that against my will , As Pompey was , am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties .
Could great men thunder As Jove himself does , Jove would ne’er be quiet , For every pelting , petty officer Would use his heaven for thunder Nothing but thunder Merciful Heaven , Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt Split’st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak Than the soft myrtle but man , proud man , Drest in a little brief authority , Most ignorant of what he’s most assured , His glassy essence , like an angry ape , Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As make the angels weep who , with our spleens , Would all themselves laugh mortal .
O , to him , to him , wench he will relent He’s coming I perceive ’t .
Pray heaven she win him
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself Great men may jest with saints ’tis wit in them , But in the less foul profanation .
Thou’rt i’ the right , girl more o , that .
That in the captain’s but a choleric word , Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy .
Fare you well . Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight , Let us be beaten if we cannot fight .
Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath , Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death .
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow Set down our host . My partner in this action , You must report to the Volscian lords , how plainly I have borne this business .
Only their ends You have respected stopp’d your ears against The general suit of Rome never admitted A private whisper , no , not with such friends That thought them sure of you .
This last old man , Whom with a crack’d heart I have sent to Rome , Loved me above the measure of a father Nay , godded me , indeed . Their latest refuge Was to send him for whose old love I have , Though I show’d sourly to him , once more offer’d The first conditions , which they did refuse And cannot now accept to grace him only That thought he could do more , a very little I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits , Nor from the state nor private friends , hereafter Will I lend ear to . Ha what shout is this
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house .
I do never use it .
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep This Jacob from our holy Abram was , As his wise mother wrought in his behalf , The third possessor , ay , he was the third
And what of him Did he take interest
No , not take interest not as you would say Directly interest . Mark what Jacob did When Laban and himself were compromised That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied Should fall as Jacob’s hire , the ewes , being rank , In the end of autumn turnèd to the rams . And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act , The skillful shepherd peeled me certain wands . And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes , Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall parti colored lambs and those were Jacob’s . This was a way to thrive , and he was blessed . And thrift is blessing , if men steal it not .
This was a venture , sir , that Jacob served for A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven . Was this inserted to make interest good Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
I cannot tell I make it breed as fast . But note me , signor
How , my lord , I may be censured , that nature thus gives way to loyalty , something fears me to think of .
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death , but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself .
How malicious is my fortune , that I must repent to be just This is the letter which he spoke of , which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France . O heavens , that this treason were not , or not I the detector
Go with me to the duchess .
If the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand .
No , believe me , ’tis very cold . The wind is northerly .
It is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
True or false , it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester . Seek out where thy father is , that he may be ready for our apprehension .
Exceedingly , my lord . It is very sultry as ’twere I cannot tell how . My lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head . Sir , this is the matter
I beseech you , remember
Nay , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith . Sir , here is newly come to court Laertes , believe me , an absolute gentleman , full of most excellent differences , of very soft society and great showing . Indeed , to speak feelingly of him , he is the card or calendar of gentry , for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see .
I will persevere in my course of loyalty , though the conflict be sore between that and my blood .
Sir , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .
I will lay trust upon thee , and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love .
There my Lysander and myself shall meet . And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies . Farewell , sweet playfellow . Pray thou for us . And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius Keep word , Lysander . We must starve our sight From lovers food till morrow deep midnight .
I will , my Hermia .
Helena , adieu . As you on him , Demetrius dote on you
How happy some o er other some can be Through Athens I am thought as fair as she . But what of that Demetrius thinks not so . He will not know what all but he do know . And as he errs , doting on Hermia’s eyes , So I , admiring of his qualities . Things base and vile , holding no quantity , Love can transpose to form and dignity . Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind . And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind . Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste . And therefore is Love said to be a child , Because in choice he is so oft beguiled . As waggish boys in game themselves forswear , So the boy Love is perjured everywhere . For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne , He hailed down oaths that he was only mine .
They have tied me to a stake . I cannot fly , But , bearlike , I must fight the course . What’s he That was not born of woman Such a one Am I to fear , or none .
What is thy name
Thou lt be afraid to hear it .
No , though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell .
My name’s Macbeth .
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear .
No , nor more fearful .
Thou liest , abhorrèd tyrant . With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st .
Thou wast born of woman . But swords I smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , Brandished by man that’s of a woman born .
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time ’tis made I will not .
My wife comes foremost then the honour’d mould Wherein this trunk was framed , and in her hand The grandchild to her blood . But , out , affection All bond and privilege of nature , break Let it be virtuous to be obstinate . What is that curt’sy worth or those doves’ eyes , Which can make gods forsworn I melt , and am not Of stronger earth than others . My mother bows As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession , which Great nature cries ‘Deny not . ’ let the Volsces Plough Rome and harrow Italy I’ll never Be such a gosling to obey instinct , but stand , As if a man were author of himself And knew no other kin .
My lord and husband
Art avised o’ that more on ’t .
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome .
Why do you put these sayings upon me
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so .
Because authority , though it err like others , Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself , That skins the vice o’ the top . Go to your bosom Knock there , and ask your heart what it doth know That’s like my brother’s fault if it confess A natural guiltiness such as is his , Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue Against my brother’s life .
She speaks , and ’tis Such sense , that my sense breeds with it . Fare you well .
Gentle my lord , turn back .
I will bethink me come again tomorrow .
Hark how I’ll bribe you good my lord , turn back .
How bribe me
Ay , with such gifts that heaven shall share with you .
You had marr’d all else .
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold , Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor As fancy values them but with true prayers That shall be up at heaven and enter there Ere sun rise , prayers from preserved souls , From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate To nothing temporal .
Mark you this , Bassanio , The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose . An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek , A goodly apple rotten at the heart . Oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath
Three thousand ducats ’tis a good round sum . Three months from twelve , then . Let me see . The rate
Well , Shylock , shall we be beholding to you
Signor Antonio , many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances . Still have I borne it with a patient shrug , For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe . You call me misbeliever , cutthroat dog , And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine And all for use of that which is mine own . Well then , it now appears you need my help . Go to , then You come to me and you say , Shylock , we would have moneys . You say so You , that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold Moneys is your suit . What should I say to you Should I not say , Hath a dog money Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this
But in the verity of extolment , I take him to be a soul of great article , and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as , to make true diction of him , his semblable is his mirror . And who else would trace him His umbrage , nothing more .
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
The concernancy , sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath
Sir
Is ’t not possible to understand in another tongue You will do ’t , sir , really .
What imports the nomination of this gentleman
Of Laertes
His purse is empty already . All ’s golden words are spent .
Of him , sir .
I know you are not ignorant
I would you did , sir . Yet in faith , if you did , it would not much approve me . Well , sir
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is
That way the noise is . Tyrant , show thy face If thou beest slain , and with no stroke of mine , My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still . I cannot strike at wretched kerns , whose arms Are hired to bear their staves . Either thou , Macbeth , Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded . There thou shouldst be By this great clatter , one of the greatest note Seems bruited . Let me find him , Fortune , And more I beg not .
This way , my lord . The castle’s gently rendered . The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight , The noble thanes do bravely in the war , The day almost itself professes yours , And little is to do .
We have met with foes That strike beside us .
Enter , sir , the castle .
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt , So he dissolved , and showers of oaths did melt . I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight . Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her . And for this intelligence If I have thanks , it is a dear expense . But herein mean I to enrich my pain , To have his sight thither and back again .
Well come to me to morrow .
Go to ’tis well away
Heaven keep your honour safe
Like a dull actor now , I have forgot my part , and I am out , Even to a full disgrace . Best of my flesh , Forgive my tyranny but do not say For that ‘Forgive our Romans . ’ O , a kiss Long as my exile , sweet as my revenge Now , by the jealous queen of heaven , that kiss I carried from thee , dear and my true lip Hath virgin’d it e’er since . You gods I prate , And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted sink , my knee , i’ the earth
Amen For I am that way going to temptation , Where prayers cross .
Of thy deep duty more impression show Than that of common sons .
At what hour to morrow Shall I attend your lordship
At any time ’fore noon .
O , stand up blest Whilst , with no softer cushion than the flint , I kneel before thee and unproperly Show duty , as mistaken all this while Between the child and parent .
’Save your honour
What is this Your knees to me to your corrected son Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds Strike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun Murdering impossibility , to make What cannot be , slight work .
From thee , even from thy virtue What’s this , what’s this Is this her fault or mine The tempter or the tempted , who sins most Ha Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I That , lying by the violet in the sun , Do as the carrion does , not as the flower , Corrupt with virtuous season . Can it be That modesty may more betray our sense Than woman’s lightness Having waste ground enough , Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary And pitch our evils there O , fie , fie , fie What dost thou , or what art thou , Angelo Dost thou desire her foully for those things That make her good O , let her brother live Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves . What , do I love her , That I desire to hear her speak again , And feast upon her eyes What is’t I dream on O cunning enemy , that , to catch a saint , With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet , With all her double vigour , art and nature , Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid Subdues me quite . Even till now , When men were fond , I smiled and wonder’d how .
Fair sir , you spet on me on Wednesday last You spurned me such a day another time You called me ’dog and for these courtesies I’ll lend you thus much moneys
I am as like to call thee so again , To spet on thee again , to spurn thee too . If thou wilt lend this money , lend it not As to thy friends , for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend But lend it rather to thine enemy , Who , if he break , thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty .
Why , look you how you storm I would be friends with you and have your love , Forget the shames that you have stained me with , Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys and you’ll not hear me This is kind I offer .
This were kindness .
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion . Now I change my mind , And partly credit things that do presage . Coming from Sardis , on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell , and there they perched , Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands , Who to Philippi here consorted us . This morning are they fled away and gone , And in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites Fly o er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey . Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal , under which Our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .
This kindness will I show . Go with me to a notary , seal me there Your single bond , and in a merry sport If you repay me not on such a day , In such a place , such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition , let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me .
Believe not so .
Content , in faith . I’ll seal to such a bond , And say there is much kindness in the Jew .
I but believe it partly , For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly .
Even so , Lucillius .
Now , most noble Brutus , The gods today stand friendly that we may , Lovers in peace , lead on our days to age . But since the affairs of men rest still incertain , Let’s reason with the worst that may befall . If we do lose this battle , then is this The very last time we shall speak together . What are you then determinèd to do
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence , but to know a man well were to know himself .
I mean , sir , for his weapon . But in the imputation laid on him by them , in his meed he’s unfellowed .
What’s his weapon
Rapier and dagger .
That’s two of his weapons . But well .
The king , sir , hath wagered with him six Barbary horses , against the which he has impawned , as I take it , six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle , hangers , and so . Three of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .
What call you the carriages
I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done .
The carriages , sir , are the hangers .
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides . I would it might be hangers till then . But , on six Barbary horses against six French swords , their assigns , and three liberal conceited carriages that’s the French bet against the Danish . Why is this impawned , as you call it
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On mine own sword Whiles I see lives , the gashes Do better upon them .
The king , sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him , he shall not exceed you three hits . He hath laid on twelve for nine , and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer .
Turn , hellhound , turn
Of all men else I have avoided thee . But get thee back . My soul is too much charged With blood of thine already .
I have no words . My voice is in my sword . Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out
Thou losest labor . As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed . Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests I bear a charmèd life , which must not yield To one of woman born .
Despair thy charm , And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee , Macduff was from his mother’s womb Untimely ripped .
Is all our company here
You were best to call them generally , man by man , according to the scrip .
Here is the scroll of every man’s name which is thought fit , through all Athens , to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess , on his wedding day at night .
First , good Peter Quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .
Marry , our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe .
A very good piece of work , I assure you , and a merry . Now , good Peter Quince , call forth your actors by the scroll . Masters , spread yourselves .
Answer as I call you . Nick Bottom , the weaver
Ready . Name what part I am for and proceed .
You , Nick Bottom , are set down for Pyramus .
Here is better than the open air . Take it thankfully . I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can . I will not be long from you .
Thou art my warrior I holp to frame thee . Do you know this lady
The noble sister of Publicola , The moon of Rome , chaste as the icicle That’s curdied by the frost from purest snow And hangs on Dian’s temple dear Valeria
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience . The gods reward your kindness
This is a poor epitome of yours , Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself .
The god of soldiers , With the consent of supreme Jove , inform Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable , and stick i’ the wars Like a great sea mark , standing every flaw , And saving those that eye thee
Your knee , sirrah .
That’s my brave boy
Even he , your wife , this lady , and myself , Are suitors to you .
I beseech you , peace Or , if you’ld ask , remember this before The thing I have forsworn to grant may never Be held by you denials . Do not bid me Dismiss my soldiers , or capitulate Again with Rome’s mechanics tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural desire not To ally my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons .
Frateretto calls me and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness . Pray , innocent , and beware the foul fiend .
Prithee , nuncle , tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman
A king , a king
No , he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son , for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him .
To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon em
Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so , For it hath cowed my better part of man And be these juggling fiends no more believed , That palter with us in a double sense , That keep the word of promise to our ear , And break it to our hope . I’ll not fight with thee .
The foul fiend bites my back .
Then yield thee , coward , And live to be the show and gaze o th time . We’ll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , Painted on a pole , and underwrit , Here may you see the tyrant .
I will not yield , To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet , And to be baited with the rabble’s curse . Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou opposed , being of no woman born , Yet I will try the last . Before my body I throw my warlike shield . Lay on , Macduff , And damned be him that first cries , Hold , enough
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived .
Some must go off . And yet , by these I see , So great a day as this is cheaply bought .
Macduff is missing , and your noble son .
You shall not seal to such a bond for me I’ll rather dwell in my necessity .
Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier’s debt . He only lived but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he died .
Why , fear not , man . I will not forfeit it . Within these two months that’s a month before This bond expires I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond .
O Father Abram , what these Christians are , Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others Pray you , tell me this If he should break his day , what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable , profitable neither , As flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats . I say , To buy his favor I extend this friendship . If he will take it , so . If not , adieu . And for my love I pray you wrong me not .
Yes , Shylock , I will seal unto this bond .
How if I answer No
I mean , my lord , the opposition of your person in trial .
Sir , I will walk here in the hall . If it please His Majesty , ’tis the breathing time of day with me . Let the foils be brought , the gentleman willing , and the king hold his purpose . I will win for him an I can . If not , I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits .
Shall I redeliver you e en so
To this effect , sir , after what flourish your nature will .
I commend my duty to your lordship .
Yours , yours .
He does well to commend it himself . There are no tongues else for ’s turn .
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head .
He did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it . Thus has he and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter , a kind of yeasty collection , which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial , the bubbles are out .
What is Pyramus A lover or a tyrant Medieval and Renaissance plays often featured tyrant characters kings who gave long , ranting speeches . tyrant
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s . Give him direction for this merry bond , And I will go and purse the ducats straight , See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave , and presently I will be with you .
A lover that kills himself , most gallant , for love .
Hie thee , gentle Jew .
The Hebrew will turn Christian . He grows kind .
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it . If I do it , let the audience look to their eyes . I will move storms . I will condole in some measure . To the rest . Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant . I could play Ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in to make all split . The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates . And Phoebus car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates . This was lofty Now name the rest of the players . This is Ercles vein , a tyrant’s vein . A lover is more condoling .
Francis Flute , the bellows mender
Here , Peter Quince .
Flute , you must take Thisbe on you .
Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself , arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below .
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome
No , Cassius , no . Think not , thou noble Roman , That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome . He bears too great a mind . But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun . And whether we shall meet again I know not . Therefore our everlasting farewell take . Forever and forever farewell , Cassius . If we do meet again , why , we shall smile . If not , why then this parting was well made .
Hail to you , provost so I think you are .
I am the provost . What’s your will , good friar
Forever and forever farewell , Brutus . If we do meet again , we’ll smile indeed . If not , ’tis true this parting was well made .
Why then , lead on . Oh , that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come But it sufficeth that the day will end , And then the end is known . Come , ho Away
Bound by my charity and my blest order , I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison . Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes , that I may minister To them accordingly .
I would do more than that , if more were needful .
O , no more , no more You have said you will not grant us any thing For we have nothing else to ask , but that Which you deny already yet we will ask That , if you fail in our request , the blame May hang upon your hardne therefore hear us .
Aufidius , and you Volsces , mark for we’ll Hear nought from Rome in private . Your request
Then he is dead
Should we be silent and not speak , our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile . Think with thyself How more unfortunate than all living women Are we come hither since that thy sight , which should Make our eyes flow with joy , hearts dance with comforts , Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow Making the mother , wife and child to see The son , the husband and the father tearing His country’s bowels out . And to poor we Thine enmity’s most capital thou barr’st us Our prayers to the gods , which is a comfort That all but we enjoy for how can we , Alas , how can we for our country pray . Whereto we are bound , together with thy victory , Whereto we are bound alack , or we must lose The country , our dear nurse , or else thy person , Our comfort in the country . We must find An evident calamity , though we had Our wish , which side should win for either thou Must , as a foreign recreant , be led With manacles thorough our streets , or else triumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin , And bear the palm for having bravely shed Thy wife and children’s blood . For myself , son , I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine if I cannot persuade thee Rather to show a noble grace to both parts Than seek the end of one , thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread Trust to’t , thou shalt not on thy mother’s womb , That brought thee to this world .
Look , here comes one a gentlewoman of mine , Who , falling in the flaws of her own youth , Hath blister’d her report she is with child And he that got it , sentenced a young man More fit to do another such offence Than die for this .
Ay , and brought off the field . Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth , for then It hath no end .
When must he die
Had he his hurts before
As I do think , to morrow .
Ay , on the front .
I have provided for you stay awhile , And you shall be conducted .
Why then , God’s soldier be he Had I as many sons as I have hairs , I would not wish them to a fairer death . And so , his knell is knolled .
He’s worth more sorrow , And that I’ll spend for him .
He’s worth no more . They say he parted well and paid his score . And so , God be with him Here comes newer comfort .
He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf , a horse’s health , a boy’s love , or a whore’s oath .
It shall be done . I will arraign them straight . Thou , sapient sir , sit here . Now , you she foxes
Hail , king For so thou art . Behold where stands The usurper’s cursèd head . The time is free . I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl , That speak my salutation in their minds , Whose voices I desire aloud with mine . Hail , King of Scotland
Look , where he stands and glares Want’st thou eyes at trial , madam Come o er the bourn , Bessy , to me
Her boat hath a leak , And she must not speak Why she dares not come over to thee .
My lord , his majesty commended him to you by young Osric , who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall . He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes , or that you will take longer time .
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale . Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring . Croak not , black angel . I have no food for thee .
I am constant to my purpose . They follow the king’s pleasure . If his fitness speaks , mine is ready , now or whensoever , provided I be so able as now .
How do you , sir Stand you not so amazed . Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions
The king and queen and all are coming down .
I’ll see their trial first . Bring in the evidence . You are o th commission . Sit you too .
In happy time .
Let us deal justly .
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play .
She well instructs me .
You will lose this wager , my lord .
I do not think so . Since he went into France , I have been in continual practice . I shall win at the odds . But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart . But it is no matter .
Nay , good my lord
It is but foolery , but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman .
What is Thisbe A wandering knight
It is the lady that Pyramus must love .
Nay , faith , let me not play a woman . I have a beard coming .
That’s all one . You shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
An I may hide my face , let me play Thisbe too I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice Thisne , Thisne Ah , Pyramus , my lover dear , thy Thisbe dear and lady dear
No , no . You must play Pyramus . And Flute , you Thisbe .
Well , proceed .
Robin Starveling , the tailor
Here , Peter Quince .
Robin Starveling , you must play Thisbe’s mother . Tom Snout , the tinker
Here , Peter Quince .
You , Pyramus father . Myself , Thisbe’s father . Snug the joiner , you , the lion’s part . And I hope here is a play fitted .
I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind .
Come on . In this there can be no dismay . My ships come home a month before the day .
Ay , and mine , That brought you forth this boy , to keep your name Living to time .
A’ shall not tread on me I’ll run away till I am bigger , but then I’ll fight .
Not of a woman’s tenderness to be , Requires nor child nor woman’s face to see . I have sat too long .
Nay , go not from us thus . If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans , thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve , you might condemn us , As poisonous of your honour no our suit Is that you reconcile them while the Volsces May say ‘This mercy we have show’d ’ the Romans , ‘This we received ’ and each in either side Give the all hail to thee and cry ‘Be blest For making up this peace ’ Thou know’st , great son , The end of war’s uncertain , but this certain , That , if thou conquer Rome , the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name , Whose repetition will be dogg’d with curses Whose chronicle thus writ ‘The man was noble , But with his last attempt he wiped it out Destroy’d his country , and his name remains To the ensuing age abhorr’d . ’ Speak to me , son Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour , To imitate the graces of the gods To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ the air , And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak . Why dost not speak Think’st thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs Daughter , speak you He cares not for your weeping . Speak thou , boy Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons . There’s no man in the world More bound to ’s mother yet here he lets me prate Like one i’ the stocks . Thou hast never in thy life Show’d thy dear mother any courtesy , When she , poor hen , fond of no second brood , Has cluck’d thee to the wars and safely home , Loaden with honour . Say my request’s unjust , And spurn me back but if it be not so , Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee , That thou restrain’st from me the duty which To a mother’s part belongs . He turns away Down , ladies let us shame him with our knees . To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride Than pity to our prayers . Down an end This is the last so we will home to Rome , And die among our neighbours . Nay , behold ’s This boy , that cannot tell what he would have But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship , Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny ’t . Come , let us go This fellow had a Volscian to his mother His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance . Yet give us our dispatch I am hush’d until our city be a fire , And then I’ll speak a little .
Sleepest or wakest thou , jolly shepherd Thy sheep be in the corn . And for one blast of thy minikin mouth , Thy sheep shall take no harm . Purr The cat is gray .
Arraign her first . Tis Goneril . I here take my oath before this honorable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father .
Come hither , mistress . Is your name Goneril
She cannot deny it .
Cry you mercy , I took you for a joint stool .
And here’s another , whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on . Stop her there Arms , arms , sword , fire , corruption in the place False justicer , why hast thou let her ’scape
Bless thy five wits .
O pity Sir , where is the patience now , That thou so oft have boasted to retain
My tears begin to take his part so much , They’ll mar my counterfeiting .
The little dogs and all , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart see , they bark at me .
Tom will throw his head at them . Avaunt , you curs Tooth that poisons if it bite , Mastiff , greyhound , mongrel grim ,
If your mind dislike anything , obey it . I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .
Not a whit . We defy augury . There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow . If it be now , ’tis not to come . If it be not to come , it will be now . If it be not now , yet it will come the readiness is all . Since no man of aught he leaves knows , what is ’t to leave betimes Let be .
Come , Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .
Give me your pardon , sir . I’ve done you wrong . But pardon ’t , as you are a gentleman . This presence knows , And you must needs have heard , how I am punished With sore distraction . What I have done , That might your nature , honor , and exception Roughly awake , I here proclaim was madness . Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes Never Hamlet . If Hamlet from himself be ta en away , And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes , Then Hamlet does it not . Hamlet denies it . Who does it , then His madness . If’t be so , Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged . His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy . Sir , in this audience ,
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side .
Let them set on at once , for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius wing , And sudden push gives them the overthrow . Ride , ride , Messala . Let them all come down .
Mislike me not for my complexion , The shadowed livery of the burnished sun , To whom I am a neighbor and near bred . Bring me the fairest creature northward born , Where Phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles , And let us make incision for your love To prove whose blood is reddest , his or mine . I tell thee , lady , this aspect of mine Hath feared the valiant . By my love I swear The best regarded virgins of our clime Have loved it too . I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts , my gentle queen .
In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes . Besides , the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing . But if my father had not scanted me And hedged me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you , Yourself , renownèd Prince , then stood as fair As any comer I have looked on yet For my affection .
Have you the lion’s part written Pray you , if it be , give it me , for I am slow of study .
You may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring .
Let me play the lion too . I will roar , that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me . I will roar , that I will make the duke say , Let him roar again . Let him roar again .
An you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek . And that were enough to hang us all .
That would hang us , every mother’s son .
I grant you , friends , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us . But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove . I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale .
You can play no part but Pyramus . For Pyramus is a sweet faced man , a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day , a most lovely , gentlemanlike man . Therefore you must needs play Pyramus .
Well , I will undertake it . What beard were I best to play it in
Why , what you will .
O mother , mother What have you done Behold , the heavens do ope , The gods look down , and this unnatural scene They laugh at . O my mother , mother O You have won a happy victory to Rome But , for your son , believe it , O , believe it , Most dangerously you have with him prevail’d , If not most mortal to him . But , let it come . Aufidius , though I cannot make true wars , I’ll frame convenient peace . Now , good Aufidius , Were you in my stead , would you have heard A mother less or granted less , Aufidius
I was moved withal .
I dare be sworn you were And , sir , it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion . But , good sir , What peace you’ll make , advise me for my part , I’ll not to Rome , I’ll back with you and pray you , Stand to me in this cause . O mother wife
I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour At difference in thee out of that I’ll work Myself a former fortune .
Hound or spaniel , brach or him , Bobtail tyke or trundle tail Tom will make them weep and wail . For with throwing thus my head , Dogs leap the hatch , and all are fled . Be thy mouth or black or white , Do de , de de . Cessez Come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns . Poor Tom , thy horn is dry .
Then let them anatomize Regan . See what breeds about her heart . Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts You , sir , I entertain you for one of my hundred . Only I do not like the fashion of your garments . You will say they are Persian attire , but let them be changed .
Now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
Make no noise , make no noise . Draw the curtains so , so , so . We’ll go to supper i th morning . So , so , so .
And I’ll go to bed at noon .
Come hither , friend . Where is the king my master
Here , sir , but trouble him not . His wits are gone .
Good friend , I prithee , take him in thy arms . I have o erheard a plot of death upon him .
O , look , Titinius , look , the villains fly Myself have to mine own turned enemy . This ensign here of mine was turning back . I slew the coward and did take it from him .
O Cassius , Brutus gave the word too early , Who , having some advantage on Octavius , Took it too eagerly . His soldiers fell to spoil , Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed .
Fly further off , my lord , fly further off . Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord . Fly , therefore , noble Cassius , fly far off .
This hill is far enough . Look , look , Titinius . Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
They are , my lord .
Titinius , if thou lovest me , Mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again , that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy .
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot mine arrow o er the house And hurt my brother .
I am satisfied in nature , Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge . But in my terms of honor I stand aloof , and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters , of known honor , I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored . But till that time I do receive your offered love like love And will not wrong it .
I embrace it freely , And will this brother’s wager frankly play . Give us the foils . Come on .
Come , one for me .
I’ll be your foil , Laertes . In mine ignorance Your skill shall , like a star i th darkest night , Stick fiery off indeed .
Even for that I thank you . Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune . By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman , I would o erstare the sternest eyes that look , Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth , Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she bear , Yea , mock the lion when he roars for prey , To win the lady . But , alas the while If Hercules and Lychas play at dice Which is the better man , the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand . So is Alcides beaten by his page , And so may I , blind fortune leading me , Miss that which one unworthier may attain And die with grieving .
You must take your chance , And either not attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose , if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage . Therefore be advised .
Nor will not . Come , bring me unto my chance .
First , forward to the temple . After dinner Your hazard shall be made .
You mock me , sir .
No , by this hand .
Give them the foils , young Osric . Cousin Hamlet , You know the wager
Very well , my lord . Your grace hath laid the odds o th weaker side .
I will discharge it in either your straw color beard , your orange tawny beard , your purple in grain beard , or your French crown color beard , your perfect yellow .
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play barefaced . But masters , here are your parts . And I am to entreat you , request you , and desire you to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood , a mile without the town , by moonlight . There will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known . In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants . I pray you , fail me not .
We will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously . Take pains . Be perfect . Adieu .
At the duke’s oak we meet .
Enough . Hold , or cut bowstrings .
Repent you , fair one , of the sin you carry
I do and bear the shame most patiently .
I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience , And try your penitence , if it be sound , Or hollowly put on .
I’ll gladly learn .
Love you the man that wrong’d you
Yes , as I love the woman that wrong’d him .
So then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committed
Mutually .
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his .
I do confess it , and repent it , father .
’Tis meet so , daughter but lest you do repent , As that the sin hath brought you to this shame , Which sorrow is always towards ourselves , not heaven , Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it , But as we stand in fear ,
I do repent me , as it is an evil , And take the shame with joy .
There rest . Your partner , as I hear , must die to morrow , And I am going with instruction to him . Grace go with you , Benedicite
Hail , King of Scotland
Good fortune then To make me blessed or cursed’st among men .
We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you . My thanes and kinsmen , Henceforth be earls , the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named . What’s more to do , Which would be planted newly with the time , As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny , Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen , Who , as ’tis thought , by self and violent hands Took off her life this , and what needful else That calls upon us , by the grace of Grace , We will perform in measure , time , and place . So , thanks to all at once and to each one , Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone .
Ay , by and by
But we will drink together and you shall bear A better witness back than words , which we , On like conditions , will have counter seal’d . Come , enter with us . Ladies , you deserve To have a temple built you all the swords In Italy , and her confederate arms , Could not have made this peace .
I will be here again , even with a thought .
Go , Pindarus , get higher on that hill . My sight was ever thick . Regard Titinius , And tell me what thou notest about the field .
This day I breathed first . Time is come round , And where I did begin , there shall I end . My life is run his compass . Sirrah , what news
O my lord
What news
Titinius is enclosèd round about With horsemen , that make to him on the spur . Yet he spurs on . Now they are almost on him . Now , Titinius . Now some light . Oh , he lights too . He’s ta en .
And , hark They shout for joy .
Come down , behold no more . Oh , coward that I am , to live so long To see my best friend ta en before my face
I do not fear it . I have seen you both . But since he is better we have therefore odds .
This is too heavy . Let me see another .
There is a litter ready . Lay him in ’t And drive towards Dover , friend , where thou shalt meet Both welcome and protection . Take up thy master . If thou shouldst dally half an hour , his life , With thine and all that offer to defend him , Stand in assurèd loss . Take up , take up , And follow me , that will to some provision Give thee quick conduct .
This likes me well . These foils have all a length
Ay , my good lord .
Oppressèd nature sleeps . This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews , Which , if convenience will not allow , Stand in hard cure . Come , help to bear thy master . Thou must not stay behind .
Come , come , away .
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table . If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the battlements their ordnance fire The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath , And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn . Give me the cups . And let the kettle to the trumpet speak , The trumpet to the cannoneer without , The cannons to the heavens , the heavens to earth , Now the king dunks to Hamlet . Come , begin . And you , the judges , bear a wary eye .
When we our betters see bearing our woes , We scarcely think our miseries our foes . Who alone suffers , suffers most i th mind , Leaving free things and happy shows behind . But then the mind much sufferance doth o erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship . How light and portable my pain seems now When that which makes me bend makes the king bow . He childed as I fathered . Tom , away Mark the high noises and thyself bewray When false opinion , whose wrong thought defiles thee , In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee . What will hap more tonight , safe ’scape the king Lurk , lurk .
Come on , sir .
Come , my lord .
How now , spirit Whither wander you
Over hill , over dale , Thorough bush , thorough brier , Over park , over pale , Thorough flood , thorough fire . I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moon’s sphere . And I serve the fairy queen To dew her orbs upon the green . The cowslips tall her pensioners be . In their gold coats spots you see . Those be rubies , fairy favors . In those freckles live their savors . I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear . Farewell , thou lob of spirits . I’ll be gone . Our queen and all our elves come here anon .
The king doth keep his revels here tonight . Take heed the queen come not within his sight . For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she , as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king . She never had so sweet a changeling . And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train , to trace the forests wild . But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy , Crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy .
Come hither , sirrah . In Parthia did I take thee prisoner . And then I swore thee , saving of thy life , That whatsoever I did bid thee do , Thou shouldst attempt it . Come now , keep thine oath . Now be a free man , and with this good sword That ran through Caesar’s bowels , search this bosom . Stand not to answer . Here take thou the hilts And , when my face is covered , as ’tis now , Guide thou the sword .
Caesar , thou art revenged , Even with the sword that killed thee .
So I am free . Yet would not so have been , Durst I have done my will . O Cassius , Far from this country Pindarus shall run , Where never Roman shall take note of him .
It is but change , Titinius , for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus power , As Cassius legions are by Antony .
These tidings will well comfort Cassius .
Where did you leave him
See you yond coign o’ the Capitol , yond corner stone
Why , what of that
If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger , there is some hope the ladies of Rome , especially his mother , may prevail with him . But I say there is no hope in’t our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution .
Is’t possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub . This Martius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he’s more than a creeping thing .
He loved his mother dearly .
So did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse . The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks , he moves like an engine , and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell , and his hum is a battery . He sits in his state , as a thing made for Alexander . What he bids be done is finished with his bidding . He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in .
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew , my master . The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me , saying to me , Gobbo , Launcelot Gobbo , Good Launcelot , or Good Gobbo , or Good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs , take the start , run away . My conscience says , No . Take heed , honest Launcelot . Take heed , honest Gobbo , or as aforesaid , Honest Launcelot Gobbo , do not run . Scorn running with thy heels . Well , the most courageous fiend bids me pack . Fia says the fiend . Away says the fiend . For the heavens , rouse up a brave mind , says the fiend , and run . Well , my conscience , hanging about the neck of my heart , says very wisely to me , My honest friend Launcelot , being an honest man’s son or rather an honest woman’s son , for indeed my father did something smack , something grow to . He had a kind of taste . Well , my conscience says , Launcelot , budge not . Budge says the fiend . Budge not , says my conscience . Conscience , say I , you counsel well . Fiend , say I , you counsel well . To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master , who , God bless the mark , is a kind of devil . And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend , who , saving your reverence , is the devil himself . Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation . And in my conscience , my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience , to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew . The fiend gives the more friendly counsel . I will run , fiend . My heels are at your command . I will run .
Must die to morrow O injurious love , That respites me a life , whose very comfort Is still a dying horror
’Tis pity of him .
One .
No .
Judgment
A hit , a very palpable hit .
Well , again .
Stay , give me drink . Hamlet , this pearl is thine . Here’s to thy health .
Give him the cup .
I’ll play this bout first . Set it by a while . Come .
Another hit . What say you
A touch , a touch , I do confess ’t .
Our son shall win .
He’s fat , and scant of breath . Here , Hamlet , take my napkin , rub thy brows . The queen carouses to thy fortune , Hamlet .
All disconsolate , With Pindarus his bondman on this hill .
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina .
Is not that he that lies upon the ground
He is very near by this . He was not three leagues off when I left him .
He lies not like the living . O my heart
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action
Is not that he
But few of any sort , and none of name .
No , this was he , Messala , But Cassius is no more . O setting sun , As in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight , So in his red blood Cassius day is set . The sun of Rome is set . Our day is gone . Clouds , dews , and dangers come Our deeds are done . Mistrust of my success hath done this deed .
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers . I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio .
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed . O hateful error , melancholy’s child , Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not O error , soon conceived , Thou never comest unto a happy birth But kill’st the mother that engendered thee
Much deserved on his part , and equally remembered by Don Pedro . He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age , doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion . He hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how .
What , Pindarus Where art thou , Pindarus
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it .
Seek him , Titinius , whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his ears . I may say thrusting it , For piercing steel and darts envenomèd Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight .
Yes , mercy , if you report him truly .
I paint him in the character . Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you .
The gods be good unto us
No , in such a case the gods will not be good unto us . When we banished him , we respected not them and , he returning to break our necks , they respect not us .
Sir , if you’ld save your life , fly to your house The plebeians have got your fellow tribune And hale him up and down , all swearing , if The Roman ladies bring not comfort home , They’ll give him death by inches .
What’s the news
Good news , good news the ladies have prevail’d , The Volscians are dislodged , and Martius gone A merrier day did never yet greet Rome , No , not the expulsion of the Tarquins .
Friend , Art thou certain this is true is it most certain
Post speedily to my lord your husband . Show him this letter . The army of France is landed . Seek out the traitor Gloucester .
And now they never meet in grove or green , By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen . But they do square , that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there .
Hang him instantly .
Either I mistake your shape and making quite , Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Called Robin Goodfellow . Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery , Skim milk , and sometimes labor in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn , And sometime make the drink to bear no barm , Mislead night wanderers , laughing at their harm Those that Hobgoblin call you , and sweet Puck , You do their work , and they shall have good luck . Are not you he
Pluck out his eyes .
Leave him to my displeasure . Edmund , keep you our sister company . The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding . Advise the duke where you are going , to a most festinate preparation . We are bound to the like . Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us . Farewell , dear sister . Farewell , my lord of Gloucester .
Thou speak’st aright . I am that merry wanderer of the night . I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean fed horse beguile , Neighing in likeness of a filly foal . And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab , And when she drinks , against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale . The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale Sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me . Then slip I from her bum , down topples she , And Tailor cries , and falls into a cough , And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , And waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there . But , room , fairy Here comes Oberon .
How now Where’s the king
And here my mistress . Would that he were gone
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence . Some five or six and thirty of his knights , Hot questrists after him , met him at gate , Who with some other of the lord’s dependants Are gone with him towards Dover , where they boast To have well armèd friends .
When I would pray and think , I think and pray To several subjects . Heaven hath my empty words Whilst my invention , hearing not my tongue , Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth , As if I did but only chew his name And in my heart the strong and swelling evil Of my conception . The state , whereon I studied Is like a good thing , being often read , Grown fear’d and tedious yea , my gravity , Wherein let no man hear me I take pride , Could I with boot change for an idle plume , Which the air beats for vain . O place , O form , How often dost thou with thy case , thy habit , Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming Blood , thou art blood Let’s write good angel on the devil’s horn ’Tis not the devil’s crest .
How now who’s there
One Isabel , a sister , desires access to you .
Teach her the way .
Hie you , Messala , And I will seek for Pindarus the while .
I have already delivered him letters , and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness .
Did he break out into tears
In great measure .
Why didst thou send me forth , brave Cassius Did I not meet thy friends And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts Alas , thou hast misconstrued everything But , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow . Thy Brutus bid me give it thee , and I Will do his bidding .
A kind overflow of kindness . There are no faces truer than those that are so washed . How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
I pray you , is Signor Montanto returned from the wars or no
Where , where , Messala , doth his body lie
Lo , yonder , and Titinius mourning it .
I know none of that name , lady . There was none such in the army of any sort .
Titinius face is upward .
What is he that you ask for , niece
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua .
He is slain .
Oh , he’s returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .
O Julius Caesar , thou art mighty yet Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails .
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight , and my uncle’s Fool , reading the challenge , subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt . I pray you , how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars But how many hath he killed For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing .
As certain as I know the sun is fire Where have you lurk’d , that you make doubt of it Ne’er through an arch so hurried the blown tide , As the recomforted through the gates . Why , hark you
The trumpets , sackbuts , psalteries and fifes , Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans , Make the sun dance . Hark you
This is good news I will go meet the ladies . This Volumnia Is worth of consuls , senators , patricians , A city full of tribunes , such as you , A sea and land full . You have pray’d well to day This morning for ten thousand of your throats I’d not have given a doit . Hark , how they joy
First , the gods bless you for your tidings next , Accept my thankfulness .
Sir , we have all Great cause to give great thanks .
They are near the city
Almost at point to enter .
Master young man , you , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew’s
O heavens , this is my true begotten father , who , being more than sand blind high gravel blind knows me not . I will try confusions with him .
Master young gentleman , I pray you , which is the way to Master Jew’s
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but at the next turning of all on your left . Marry , at the very next turning turn of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house .
By God’s sonties , ’twill be a hard way to hit . Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him , dwell with him or no
Ill met by moonlight , proud Titania .
Talk you of young Master Launcelot Mark me now . Now will I raise the waters . Talk you of young Master Launcelot
What , jealous Oberon Fairies , skip hence . I have forsworn his bed and company .
No master , sir , but a poor man’s son . His father , though I say ’t , is an honest exceeding poor man and , God be thanked , well to live .
Tarry , rash wanton . Am not I thy lord
Well , let his father be what he will , we talk of young Master Launcelot .
Then I must be thy lady . But I know When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland , And in the shape of Corin sat all day , Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida . Why art thou here , Come from the farthest step of India But that , forsooth , the bouncing Amazon , Your buskined mistress and your warrior love , To Theseus must be wedded , and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity .
How canst thou thus for shame , Titania , Knowing I know thy love to Theseus Glance at my credit with Hippolyta , Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna , whom he ravishèd And make him with fair Ægles break his faith , With Ariadne and Antiopa
Your worship’s friend and Launcelot , sir .
Brave Titinius Look whe er he have not crowned dead Cassius .
Are yet two Romans living such as these The last of all the Romans , fare thee well It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow . Friends , I owe more tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay . I shall find time , Cassius , I shall find time . Come , therefore , and to Thasos send his body . His funerals shall not be in our camp , Lest it discomfort us . Lucillius , come . And come , young Cato . Let us to the field . Labio and Flavio , set our battles on . Tis three o clock , and , Romans , yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight .
O heavens Why does my blood thus muster to my heart , Making both it unable for itself , And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitness So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons Come all to help him , and so stop the air By which he should revive and even so The general , subject to a well wish’d king , Quit their own part , and in obsequious fondness Crowd to his presence , where their untaught love Must needs appear offence .
How now , fair maid
I am come to know your pleasure .
That you might know it , would much better please me Than to demand what ’tis . Your brother cannot live .
Even so . Heaven keep your honour
Yet may he live awhile and , it may be , As long as you or I yet he must die .
Under your sentence
Get horses for your mistress .
Farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
Edmund , farewell .
Go seek the traitor Gloucester . Pinion him like a thief , bring him before us .
Though well we may not pass upon his life Without the form of justice , yet our power Shall do a courtesy to our wrath , which men May blame , but not control . Who’s there The traitor
Ingrateful fox , ’tis he .
Bind fast his corky arms .
What mean your graces Good my friends , consider You are my guests . Do me no foul play , friends .
Bind him , I say .
Faith , niece , you tax Signor Benedick too much , but he’ll be meet with you , I doubt it not .
He hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
You had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it . He is a very valiant trencherman . He hath an excellent stomach .
And a good soldier too , lady .
And a good soldier to a lady , but what is he to a lord
A lord to a lord , a man to a man , stuffed with all honorable virtues .
It is so indeed . He is no less than a stuffed man . But for the stuffing well , we are all mortal .
You must not , sir , mistake my niece . There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her . They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them .
Alas , he gets nothing by that . In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off , and now is the whole man governed with one , so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm , let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse , for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature . Who is his companion now He hath every month a new sworn brother .
Is ’t possible
We will meet them , And help the joy .
These are the forgeries of jealousy . And never , since the middle summer’s spring , Met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , By pavèd fountain , or by rushy brook , Or in the beachèd margent of the sea , To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport . Therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , As in revenge , have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs , which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents . The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , The ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard . The fold stands empty in the drownèd field , And crows are fatted with the murrain flock . The nine men’s morris is filled up with mud , And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable . The human mortals want their winter here . No night is now with hymn or carol blessed . Therefore the moon , the governess of floods , Pale in her anger , washes all the air , That rheumatic diseases do abound . And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoary headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose , And on old Hiems thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is , as in mockery , set . The spring , the summer , The childing autumn , angry winter change Their wonted liveries , and the mazèd world , By their increase , now knows not which is which . And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate , from our dissension . We are their parents and original .
But I pray you , ergo , old man , ergo , I beseech you , talk you of young Master Launcelot
Of Launcelot , an ’t please your mastership .
Good madam .
Ergo , Master Launcelot . Talk not of Master Launcelot , Father , for the young gentleman , according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings , the Sisters Three and such branches of learning , is indeed deceased , or as you would say in plain terms , gone to heaven .
Gertrude , do not drink .
Marry , God forbid The boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
I will , my lord . I pray you , pardon me .
Yet , countrymen , O , yet hold up your heads
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel post , a staff or a prop Do you know me , Father
It is the poisoned cup . It is too late .
Alack the day , I know you not , young gentleman . But I pray you , tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead
I dare not drink yet , madam . By and by .
What bastard doth not Who will go with me I will proclaim my name about the field . I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho A foe to tyrants , and my country’s friend . I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho
Do you not know me , Father
Come , let me wipe thy face .
Alack , sir , I am sand blind . I know you not .
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus , I Brutus , my country’s friend . Know me for Brutus
Nay , indeed if you had your eyes , you might fail of the knowing me . It is a wise father that knows his own child . Well , old man , I will tell you news of your son . Give me your blessing . Truth will come to light . Murder cannot be hid long a man’s son may , but in the end truth will out .
O young and noble Cato , art thou down Why , now thou diest as bravely as Titinius , And mayst be honored , being Cato’s son .
Yield , or thou diest .
Only I yield to die . There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight . Kill Brutus , and be honored in his death .
We must not . A noble prisoner
Yea .
When , I beseech you that in his reprieve , Longer or shorter , he may be so fitted That his soul sicken not .
Ha fie , these filthy vices It were as good To pardon him that hath from nature stolen A man already made , as to remit Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s image In stamps that are forbid ’tis all as easy Falsely to take away a life true made As to put metal in restrained means To make a false one .
’Tis set down so in heaven , but not in earth .
Say you so then I shall pose you quickly . Which had you rather , that the most just law Now took your brother’s life or , to redeem him , Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness As she that he hath stain’d
Sir , believe this , I had rather give my body than my soul .
I talk not of your soul our compell’d sins Stand more for number than for accompt .
How say you
My lord , I’ll hit him now .
I do not think ’t .
And yet it is almost gainst my conscience .
Come , for the third , Laertes . You do but dally . I pray you , pass with your best violence . I am afeard you make a wanton of me .
Say you so Come on .
Nothing , neither way .
Have at you now
Part them They are incensed .
Room , ho Tell Antony Brutus is ta en .
I’ll tell the news . Here comes the general . Brutus is ta en , Brutus is ta en , my lord .
Where is he
Safe , Antony . Brutus is safe enough . I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus . The gods defend him from so great a shame When you do find him , or alive or dead , He will be found like Brutus , like himself .
This is not Brutus , friend , but , I assure you , A prize no less in worth . Keep this man safe . Give him all kindness . I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies . Go on , And see whether Brutus be alive or dead . And bring us word unto Octavius tent How everything is chanced .
Behold our patroness , the life of Rome Call all your tribes together , praise the gods , And make triumphant fires strew flowers before them Unshout the noise that banish’d Martius , Repeal him with the welcome of his mother Cry ‘Welcome , ladies , welcome ’
Welcome , ladies , Welcome
Hard , hard . O filthy traitor
Unmerciful lady as you are , I’m none .
To this chair bind him . Villain , thou shalt find
By the kind gods , ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard .
So white , and such a traitor
Naughty lady , These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee . I am your host . With robbers hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus . What will you do
Come , sir , what letters had you late from France
Be simple answered , for we know the truth .
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king . Speak .
I have a letter guessingly set down , Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart , And not from one opposed .
Cunning .
Pray you , sir , stand up . I am sure you are not Launcelot , my boy .
Pray you , let’s have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing . I am Launcelot , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
I cannot think you are my son .
I know not what I shall think of that . But I am Launcelot , the Jew’s man , and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother .
Her name is Margery , indeed . I’ll be sworn , if thou be Launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood . Lord worshipped might he be , what a beard hast thou got Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill horse has on his tail .
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward . I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him .
Lord , how art thou changed How dost thou and thy master agree I have brought him a present . How gree you now
Well , well , but for mine own part , as I have set up my rest to run away , so I will not rest till I have run some ground . My master’s a very Jew . Give him a present . Give him a halter . I am famished in his service . You may tell every finger I have with my ribs . Father , I am glad you are come . Give me your present to one Master Bassanio , who indeed gives rare new liveries .
Nay , I’ll not warrant that for I can speak Against the thing I say . Answer to this I , now the voice of the recorded law , Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life Might there not be a charity in sin To save this brother’s life
Please you to do’t , I’ll take it as a peril to my soul , It is no sin at all , but charity .
Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul , Were equal poise of sin and charity .
That I do beg his life , if it be sin , Heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit , If that be sin , I’ll make it my morn prayer To have it added to the faults of mine , And nothing of your answer .
Come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
Nay , but hear me . Your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant , Or seem so craftily and that’s not good .
Statilius showed the torchlight but , my lord , He came not back . He is or ta en or slain .
Let me be ignorant , and in nothing good , But graciously to know I am no better .
Sit thee down , Clitus . Slaying is the word . It is a deed in fashion . Hark thee , Clitus .
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright When it doth tax itself as these black masks Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder Than beauty could , display’d . But mark me To be received plain , I’ll speak more gro Your brother is to die .
What , I , my lord No , not for all the world .
Peace then No words .
I’ll rather kill myself .
Hark thee , Dardanius .
Shall I do such a deed
O Dardanius
O Clitus
Nay , come , again .
What ill request did Brutus make to thee
To kill him , Clitus . Look , he meditates .
Look to the queen there , ho
They bleed on both sides . How is it , my lord
How is ’t , Laertes
Why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , Osric . I am justly killed with mine own treachery .
How does the queen
She swoons to see them bleed .
No , no , the drink , the drink O my dear Hamlet The drink , the drink I am poisoned .
O villainy Ho , let the door be locked .
Treachery Seek it out .
It is here , Hamlet . Hamlet , thou art slain . No medicine in the world can do thee good . In thee there is not half an hour of life . The treacherous instrument is in thy hand , Unbated and envenomed . The foul practice Hath turned itself on me . Lo , here I lie , Never to rise again . Thy mother’s poisoned . I can no more . The king , the king’s to blame .
The point envenomed too Then , venom , to thy work .
Go tell the lords o’ the city I am here Deliver them this paper having read it , Bid them repair to the market place where I , Even in theirs and in the commons’ ears , Will vouch the truth of it . Him I accuse The city ports by this hath enter’d and Intends to appear before the people , hoping To purge herself with words dispatch .
Most welcome
How is it with our general
Very easily possible . He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block .
Even so As with a man by his own alms empoison’d , And with his charity slain .
I see , lady , the gentleman is not in your books .
Most noble sir , If you do hold the same intent wherein You wish’d us parties , we’ll deliver you Of your great danger .
No . An he were , I would burn my study . But I pray you , who is his companion Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil
Sir , I cannot tell We must proceed as we do find the people .
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio .
O Lord , he will hang upon him like a disease He is sooner caught than the pestilence , and the taker runs presently mad . God help the noble Claudio If he have caught the Benedick , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured .
I will hold friends with you , lady .
Do , good friend .
You will never run mad , niece .
No , not till a hot January .
Don Pedro is approached .
Good Signor Leonato , are you come to meet your trouble The fashion of the world is to avoid cost , and you encounter it .
Do you amend it then . It lies in you . Why should Titania cross her Oberon I do but beg a little changeling boy , To be my henchman .
Set your heart at rest . The Fairyland buys not the child of me . His mother was a votaress of my order , And in the spicèd Indian air by night Full often hath she gossiped by my side , And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands , Marking th embarkèd traders on the flood , When we have laughed to see the sails conceive And grow big bellied with the wanton wind Which she , with pretty and with swimming gait Following her womb then rich with my young squire Would imitate , and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage , rich with merchandise . But she , being mortal , of that boy did die . And for her sake do I rear up her boy , And for her sake I will not part with him .
How long within this wood intend you stay
Perchance till after Theseus wedding day . If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels , go with us . If not , shun me , and I will spare your haunts .
Give me that boy and I will go with thee .
Not for thy fairy kingdom . Fairies , away We shall chide downright , if I longer stay .
If I serve not him , I will run as far as God has any ground . O rare fortune Here comes the man . To him , Father , for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer .
You may do so , but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock . See these letters delivered , put the liveries to making , and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging .
To him , Father .
God bless your worship
Gramercy Wouldst thou aught with me
Here’s my son , sir , a poor boy
Not a poor boy , sir , but the rich Jew’s man that would , sir , as my father shall specify
He hath a great infection , sir , as one would say , to serve
Indeed the short and the long is , I serve the Jew and have a desire , as my father shall specify
And false .
Where hast thou sent the king
Treason Treason
To Dover .
O , yet defend me , friends . I am but hurt .
Wherefore to Dover Wast thou not charged at peril
Wherefore to Dover Let him first answer that .
I am tied to th stake , and I must stand the course .
Wherefore to Dover , sir
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes , nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs . The sea , with such a storm as his bare head In hell black night endured , would have buoyed up , And quenched the stellèd fires . Yet poor old heart , he holp the heavens to rain . If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time , Thou shouldst have said , Good porter , turn the key , All cruèls else subscribed . But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children .
Here , thou incestuous , murderous , damnèd Dane , Drink off this potion . Is thy union here Follow my mother .
See ’t shalt thou never . Fellows , hold the chair . Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot .
He is justly served . It is a poison tempered by himself . Exchange forgiveness with me , noble Hamlet . Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee , Nor thine on me .
He that will think to live till he be old , Give me some help
Heaven make thee free of it . I follow thee . I am dead , Horatio . Wretched queen , adieu You that look pale and tremble at this chance , That are but mutes or audience to this act , Had I but time , O , I could tell you But let it be . Horatio , I am dead . Thou livest . Report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied .
Never believe it . I am more an antique Roman than a Dane . Here’s yet some liquor left .
So .
And his offence is so , as it appears , Accountant to the law upon that pain .
Now is that noble vessel full of grief , That it runs over even at his eyes .
True .
Come hither , good Volumnius . List a word .
Admit no other way to save his life , As I subscribe not that , nor any other , But in the loss of question , that you , his sister , Finding yourself desired of such a person , Whose credit with the judge , or own great place , Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the all building law and that there were No earthly mean to save him , but that either You must lay down the treasures of your body To this supposed , or else to let him suffer What would you do
What says my lord
As much for my poor brother as myself That is , were I under the terms of death , The impression of keen whips I’ld wear as rubies , And strip myself to death , as to a bed That longing have been sick for , ere I’ld yield My body up to shame .
Why this , Volumnius The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me Two several times by night . At Sardis once , And this last night here in Philippi fields . I know my hour is come .
Then must your brother die .
Not so , my lord .
And ’twere the cheaper way Better it were a brother died at once , Than that a sister , by redeeming him , Should die for ever .
Nay , I am sure it is , Volumnius . Thou seest the world , Volumnius , how it goes . Our enemies have beat us to the pit .
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us . Good Volumnius , Thou know’st that we two went to school together . Even for that our love of old , I prithee , Hold thou my sword hilts , whilst I run on it .
That’s not an office for a friend , my lord .
Fly , fly , my lord . There is no tarrying here .
His master and he , saving your worship’s reverence , are scarce cater cousins
To be brief , the very truth is that the Jew , having done me wrong , doth cause me , as my father , being , I hope , an old man , shall frutify unto you
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship , and my suit is
In very brief , the suit is impertinent to myself , as your worship shall know by this honest old man and though I say it , though old man , yet poor man , my father
One speak for both . What would you
Serve you , sir .
That is the very defect of the matter , sir .
I know thee well . Thou hast obtained thy suit . Shylock thy master spoke with me this day , And hath preferred thee , if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew’s service , to become The follower of so poor a gentleman .
The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you , sir you have the grace of God , sir , and he hath enough .
Thou speak’st it well . Go , father , with thy son . Take leave of thy old master and inquire My lodging out . Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows . See it done .
Farewell to you . And you . And you , Volumnius . Strato , thou hast been all this while asleep . Farewell to thee too , Strato . Countrymen , My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me . I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto . So fare you well at once , for Brutus tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history . Night hangs upon mine eyes . My bones would rest , That have but labored to attain this hour .
Fly , my lord , fly .
Hence . I will follow .
I prithee , Strato , stay thou by thy lord . Thou art a fellow of a good respect . Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it . Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it . Wilt thou , Strato
Give me your hand first . Fare you well , my lord .
Well , go thy way . Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury . My gentle Puck , come hither . Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the seamaid’s music
I remember .
That very time I saw Flying between the cold moon and the Earth , Cupid all armed . A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west , And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts . But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon , And the imperial votaress passèd on , In maiden meditation , fancy free . Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell . It fell upon a little western flower , Before milk white , now purple with love’s wound . And maidens call it love in idleness . Fetch me that flower . The herb I showed thee once . The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees . Fetch me this herb , and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league .
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes .
The people will remain uncertain whilst ’Twixt you there’s difference but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all .
I know it And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction . I raised him , and I pawn’d Mine honour for his truth who being so heighten’d , He water’d his new plants with dews of flattery , Seducing so my friends and , to this end , He bow’d his nature , never known before But to be rough , unswayable and free .
Sir , his stoutness When he did stand for consul , which he lost By lack of stooping ,
That I would have spoke of Being banish’d for’t , he came unto my hearth Presented to my knife his throat I took him Made him joint servant with me gave him way In all his own desires nay , let him choose Out of my files , his projects to accomplish , My best and freshest men served his designments In mine own person holp to reap the fame Which he did end all his and took some pride To do myself this wrong till , at the last , I seem’d his follower , not partner , and He waged me with his countenance , as if I had been mercenary .
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace , for trouble being gone , comfort should remain , but when you depart from me , sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave .
You embrace your charge too willingly . I think this is your daughter .
Her mother hath many times told me so .
Were you in doubt , sir , that you asked her
Signor Benedick , no , for then were you a child .
You have it full , Benedick . We may guess by this what you are , being a man . Truly , the lady fathers herself . Be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .
If Signor Leonato be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina , as like him as she is .
I wonder that you will still be talking , Signor Benedick . Nobody marks you .
What , my dear Lady Disdain Are you yet living
As thou rt a man , Give me the cup . Let go By heaven , I’ll have ’t . O God , Horatio , what a wounded name , Things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story .
What warlike noise is this
Young Fortinbras , with conquest come from Poland , To th ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley .
O , I die , Horatio . The potent poison quite o ercrows my spirit . I cannot live to hear the news from England . But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras . He has my dying voice . So tell him , with th occurrents , more and less , Which have solicited . The rest is silence . O , O , O , O .
Now cracks a noble heart . Good night , sweet prince , And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest Why does the drum come hither
O cruel O you gods
One side will mock another th other too .
If you see vengeance
Hold your hand , my lord I have served you ever since I was a child . But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold .
Farewell , good Strato .
How now , you dog
If you did wear a beard upon your chin , I’d shake it on this quarrel . What do you mean
What man is that
Father , in . I cannot get a service , no . I have ne er a tongue in my head . Well , if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book , I shall have good fortune . Go to , here’s a simple line of life . Here’s a small trifle of wives . Alas , fifteen wives is nothing Eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming in for one man . And then to ’scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather bed here are simple ’scapes . Well , if Fortune be a woman , she’s a good wench for this gear . Father , come . I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling .
My master’s man . Strato , where is thy master
My villein
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala . The conquerors can but make a fire of him . For Brutus only overcame himself , And no man else hath honor by his death .
I pray thee , good Leonardo , think on this . These things being bought and orderly bestowed , Return in haste , for I do feast tonight My best esteemed acquaintance . Hie thee , go .
My best endeavours shall be done herein .
Where is your master
Yonder , sir , he walks .
So he did , my lord The army marvell’d at it , and , in the last , When he had carried Rome and that we look’d For no less spoil than glory ,
Nay then , come on , and take the chance of anger .
There was it For which my sinews shall be stretch’d upon him . At a few drops of women’s rheum , which are As cheap as lies , he sold the blood and labour Of our great action therefore shall he die , And I’ll renew me in his fall . But , hark

Your native town you enter’d like a post , And had no welcomes home but he returns , Splitting the air with noise .
Oh , I am slain My lord , you have one eye left To see some mischief on him . Oh
And patient fools , Whose children he hath slain , their base throats tear With giving him glory .
Lest it see more , prevent it . Out , vile jelly
Therefore , at your vantage , Ere he express himself , or move the people With what he would say , let him feel your sword , Which we will second . When he lies along , After your way his tale pronounced shall bury His reasons with his body .
So Brutus should be found . I thank thee , Brutus , That thou hast proved Lucillius saying true .
All that served Brutus , I will entertain them . Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me
Ay , if Messala will prefer me to you .
Do so , good Messala .
Having once this juice , I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes . The next thing then she waking looks upon Be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , On meddling monkey or on busy ape She shall pursue it with the soul of love . And ere I take this charm from of her sight As I can take it with another herb I’ll make her render up her page to me . But who comes here I am invisible . And I will overhear their conference .
How died my master , Strato
I held the sword and he did run on it .
I love thee not , therefore pursue me not . Where is Lysander and fair Hermia The one I’ll stay , the other stayeth me . Thou told’st me they were stol n unto this wood . And here am I , and wood within this wood , Because I cannot meet my Hermia . Hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
Octavius , then take him to follow thee , That did the latest service to my master .
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signor Benedick Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence .
Then is courtesy a turncoat . But it is certain I am loved of all ladies , only you excepted . And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart , for truly I love none .
A dear happiness to women . They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor . I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that . I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind , so some gentle man or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face .
Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were .
Well , you are a rare parrot teacher .
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer . But keep your way , i God’s name . I have done .
You draw me , you hard hearted adamant . But yet you draw not iron , for my heart Is true as steel . Leave you your power to draw , And I shall have no power to follow you .
Do I entice you Do I speak you fair Or rather , do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not , nor I cannot , love you
Where is this sight
What is it ye would see If aught of woe or wonder , cease your search .
This quarry cries on havoc . O proud death , What feast is toward in thine eternal cell , That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck
The sight is dismal , And our affairs from England come too late . The ears are senseless that should give us hearing , To tell him his commandment is fulfilled , That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead . Where should we have our thanks
Not from his mouth , Had it th ability of life to thank you . He never gave commandment for their death . But since so jump upon this bloody question , You from the Polack wars , and you from England , Are here arrived , give order that these bodies High on a stage be placèd to the view , And let me speak to th yet unknowing world How these things came about . So shall you hear Of carnal , bloody , and unnatural acts , Of accidental judgments , casual slaughters , Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause , And , in this upshot , purposes mistook Fall n on th inventors heads . All this can I Truly deliver .
Let us haste to hear it , And call the noblest to the audience . For me , with sorrow I embrace my fortune . I have some rights of memory in this kingdom , Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me .
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slander’d so
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption .
You seem’d of late to make the law a tyrant And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice .
O , pardon me , my lord it oft falls out , To have what we would have , we speak not what we mean I something do excuse the thing I hate , For his advantage that I dearly love .
We are all frail .
You always end with a jade’s trick . I know you of old .
Else let my brother die , If not a feodary , but only he Owe and succeed thy weakness .
Nay , women are frail too .
That is the sum of all , Leonato . Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick , my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all . I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer . I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .
Ay , as the glasses where they view themselves Which are as easy broke as they make forms . Women Help Heaven men their creation mar In profiting by them . Nay , call us ten times frail For we are soft as our complexions are , And credulous to false prints .
Where is thy luster now
All dark and comfortless . Where’s my son Edmund Edmund , enkindle all the sparks of nature To quit this horrid act .
Out , treacherous villain Thou call’st on him that hates thee . It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us , Who is too good to pity thee .
O my follies Then Edgar was abused . Kind gods , forgive me that , and prosper him
Go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell His way to Dover .
How is ’t , my lord How look you
I have received a hurt . Follow me , lady . Turn out that eyeless villain . Throw this slave Upon the dunghill . Regan , I bleed apace . Untimely comes this hurt . Give me your arm .
I’ll never care what wickedness I do , If this man come to good .
If she live long , And in the end meet the old course of death , Women will all turn monsters .
Of that I shall have also cause to speak , And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more . But let this same be presently performed , Even while men’s minds are wild , lest more mischance On plots and errors happen .
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage , For he was likely , had he been put on , To have proved most royally . And , for his passage , The soldiers music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him . Take up the bodies . Such a sight as this Becomes the field , but here shows much amiss . Go , bid the soldiers shoot .
I think it well And from this testimony of your own sex , Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Than faults may shake our frames , let me be bold I do arrest your words . Be that you are , That is , a woman if you be more , you’re none If you be one , as you are well express’d By all external warrants , show it now , By putting on the destined livery .
I have no tongue but one gentle my lord , Let me entreat you speak the former language .
Plainly conceive , I love you .
My brother did love Juliet , And you tell me that he shall die for it .
He shall not , Isabel , if you give me love .
I know your virtue hath a licence in’t , Which seems a little fouler than it is , To pluck on others .
Believe me , on mine honour , My words express my purpose .
Ha little honour to be much believed , And most pernicious purpose Seeming , seeming I will proclaim thee , Angelo look for’t Sign me a present pardon for my brother , Or with an outstretch’d throat I’ll tell the world aloud What man thou art .
If you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn . Let me bid you welcome , my lord . Being reconciled to the Prince your brother , I owe you all duty .
I thank you . I am not of many words , but I thank you .
Please it your Grace lead on
Your hand , Leonato . We will go together .
Benedick , didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato
I noted her not , but I looked on her .
Is she not a modest young lady
Do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment Or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex
No , I pray thee speak in sober judgment .
Why , i faith , methinks she’s too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise . Only this commendation I can afford her , that were she other than she is , she were unhandsome , and being no other but as she is , I do not like her .
Say no more Here come the lords .
Thou thinkest I am in sport . I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her .
You are most welcome home .
I have not deserved it . But , worthy lords , have you with heed perused What I have written to you
We have .
And grieve to hear’t . What faults he made before the last , I think Might have found easy fines but there to end Where he was to begin and give away The benefit of our levies , answering us With our own charge , making a treaty where There was a yielding , this admits no excuse .
He approaches you shall hear him .
Hail , lords I am return’d your soldier , No more infected with my country’s love Than when I parted hence , but still subsisting Under your great command . You are to know That prosperously I have attempted and With bloody passage led your wars even to The gates of Rome . Our spoils we have brought home Do more than counterpoise a full third part The charges of the action . We have made peace With no less honour to the Antiates Than shame to the Romans and we here deliver , Subscribed by the consuls and patricians , Together with the seal o’ the senate , what We have compounded on .
Signor Bassanio
Gratiano
I have a suit to you .
You have obtained it .
You must not deny me . I must go with you to Belmont .
Why , then you must . But hear thee , Gratiano . Thou art too wild , too rude and bold of voice Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults . But where thou art not known , why , there they show Something too liberal . Pray thee , take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit , lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst’red in the place I go to , And lose my hopes .
Signor Bassanio , hear me . If I do not put on a sober habit , Talk with respect and swear but now and then , Wear prayer books in my pocket , look demurely Nay more . While grace is saying , hood mine eyes Thus with my hat , and sigh and say , Amen Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam , never trust me more .
Well , we shall see your bearing .
Nay , but I bar tonight . You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight .
This was the noblest Roman of them all . All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar . He only in a general honest thought And common good to all , made one of them . His life was gentle , and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world , This was a man .
According to his virtue let us use him , With all respect and rites of burial . Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier , ordered honorably . So call the field to rest , and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day .
Let’s follow the old earl , and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would . His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing .
Go thou . I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face . Now heaven help him
And even for that do I love you the more . I am your spaniel . And , Demetrius , The more you beat me , I will fawn on you . Use me but as your spaniel spurn me , strike me , Neglect me , lose me . Only give me leave , Unworthy as I am , to follow you . What worser place can I beg in your love And yet a place of high respect with me Than to be usèd as you use your dog
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit . For I am sick when I do look on thee .
Who will believe thee , Isabel My unsoil’d name , the austereness of my life , My vouch against you , and my place i’ the state , Will so your accusation overweigh , That you shall stifle in your own report And smell of calumny . I have begun , And now I give my sensual race the rein Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes , That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother By yielding up thy body to my will Or else he must not only die the death , But thy unkindness shall his death draw out To lingering sufferance . Answer me to morrow , Or , by the affection that now guides me most , I’ll prove a tyrant to him . As for you , Say what you can , my false o’erweighs your true .
And I am sick when I look not on you .
You do impeach your modesty too much , To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not , To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity .
To whom should I complain Did I tell this , Who would believe me O perilous mouths , That bear in them one and the self same tongue , Either of condemnation or approof Bidding the law make court’sy to their will Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite , To follow as it draws I’ll to my brother Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood , Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour . That , had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks , he’ld yield them up , Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorr’d pollution . Then , Isabel , live chaste , and , brother , die More than our brother is our chastity . I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request , And fit his mind to death , for his soul’s rest .
Your virtue is my privilege . For that It is not night when I do see your face . Therefore I think I am not in the night . Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , For you in my respect are all the world . Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .
The wildest hath not such a heart as you . Run when you will , the story shall be changed .
Would you buy her , that you enquire after her
Can the world buy such a jewel
Yea , and a case to put it into . But speak you this with a sad brow Or do you play the flouting jack , to tell us Cupid is a good hare finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on .
I can see yet without spectacles , and I see no such matter . There’s her cousin , an she were not possessed with a fury , exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December . But I hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you
I would scarce trust myself , though I had sworn the contrary , if Hero would be my wife .
Is ’t come to this In faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a bachelor of three score again Go to , i faith , an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke , wear the print of it , and sigh away Sundays . Look , Don Pedro is returned to seek you .
Yet better thus , and known to be contemned , Than still contemned and flattered . To be worst , The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune Stands still in esperance , lives not in fear . The lamentable change is from the best The worst returns to laughter . Welcome , then , Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst Owes nothing to thy blasts .
But who comes here My father , poorly led World , world , O world But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , Life would not yield to age .
O my good lord , I have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years .
Away , get thee away . Good friend , be gone . Thy comforts can do me no good at all . Thee they may hurt .
Alack , sir , you cannot see your way .
I have no way , and therefore want no eyes .
Tush Never tell me . I take it much unkindly That thou , Iago , who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .
Sblood , but you’ll not hear me If ever I did dream of such a matter , abhor me .
Thou told’st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate .
Despise me If I do not . Three great ones of the city That never set a squadron in the field , Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric ,
No , that were pity . I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth , for we have friends That purpose merriment . But fare you well . I have some business .
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest . But we will visit you at supper time .
What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato’s
I would your grace would constrain me to tell .
I charge thee on thy allegiance .
You hear , Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man , I would have you think so , but on my allegiance mark you this , on my allegiance he is in love . With who Now , that is your Grace’s part . Mark how short his answer is with Hero , Leonato’s short daughter .
If this were so , so were it uttered .
Like the old tale , my lord It is not so nor ’twas not so but , indeed , God forbid it should be so .
If my passion change not shortly , God forbid it should be otherwise .
Amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
You speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
Read it not , noble lords But tell the traitor , in the high’st degree He hath abused your powers .
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase . The dove pursues the griffin . The mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed , When cowardice pursues and valor flies .
By my troth , I speak my thought .
Traitor how now
I will not stay thy questions . Let me go . Or if thou follow me , do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood .
And , in faith , my lord , I spoke mine .
Ay , traitor , Martius
Ay , in the temple , in the town , the field You do me mischief . Fie , Demetrius Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex . We cannot fight for love as men may do . We should be wooed and were not made to woo .
Martius
I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , To die upon the hand I love so well .
Ay , Martius , Caius Martius dost thou think I’ll grace thee with that robbery , thy stol’n name Coriolanus in Corioli You lords and heads o’ the state , perfidiously He has betray’d your business , and given up , For certain drops of salt , your city Rome , I say ‘your city , ’ to his wife and mother Breaking his oath and resolution like A twist of rotten silk , never admitting Counsel o’ the war , but at his nurse’s tears He whined and roar’d away your victory , That pages blush’d at him and men of heart Look’d wondering each at other .
Fare thee well , nymph . Ere he do leave this grove , Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .
Hear’st thou , Mars
Name not the god , thou boy of tears
Hast thou the flower there Welcome , wanderer .
Ha
Ay , there it is .
No more .
I pray thee , give it me . I know a bank where the wild thyme blows , Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows , Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine , With sweet musk roses and with eglantine .
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo
The miserable have no other medicine But only hope I’ve hope to live , and am prepared to die .
Be absolute for death either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter . Reason thus with life If I do lose thee , I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep a breath thou art , Servile to all the skyey influences , That dost this habitation , where thou keep’st , Hourly afflict merely , thou art death’s fool For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun And yet runn’st toward him still . Thou art not noble For all the accommodations that thou bear’st Are nursed by baseness . Thou’rt by no means valiant For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork Of a poor worm . Thy best of rest is sleep , And that thou oft provokest yet grossly fear’st Thy death , which is no more . Thou art not thyself For thou exist’st on many a thousand grains That issue out of dust . Happy thou art not For what thou hast not , still thou strivest to get , And what thou hast , forget’st . Thou art not certain For thy complexion shifts to strange effects , After the moon . If thou art rich , thou’rt poor For , like an ass whose back with ingots bows , Thou bear’s thy heavy riches but a journey , And death unloads thee . Friend hast thou none For thine own bowels , which do call thee sire , The mere effusion of thy proper loins , Do curse the gout , serpigo , and the rheum , For ending thee no sooner . Thou hast nor youth nor age , But , as it were , an after dinner’s sleep , Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged , and doth beg the alms Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich , Thou hast neither heat , affection , limb , nor beauty , To make thy riches pleasant . What’s yet in this That bears the name of life Yet in this life Lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear , That makes these odds all even .
Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he . Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership . But he , sir , had th election And I , of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes , at Cyprus , and on other grounds Christian and heathen , must be belee’d and calmed By debitor and creditor . This counter caster He must his lieutenant be And I , bless the mark , his Moorship’s ancient .
By heaven , I rather would have been his hangman .
I stumbled when I saw . Full oft ’tis seen , Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities . O dear son Edgar , The food of thy abusèd father’s wrath , Might I but live to see thee in my touch , I’d say I had eyes again
Why , there’s no remedy . Tis the curse of service . Preferment goes by letter and affection , And not by old gradation , where each second Stood heir to th first . Now sir , be judge yourself , Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor .
How now Who’s there
I would not follow him then .
O gods Who is ’t can say I am at the worst I am worse than e er I was .
O sir , content you . I follow him to serve my turn upon him . We cannot all be masters , nor all masters Cannot be truly followed . You shall mark Many a duteous and knee crooking knave That Wears out his time much like his master’s ass For naught but provender , and when he’s old , cashiered . Whip me such honest knaves . Others there are Who , trimmed in forms and visages of duty , Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves And , throwing but shows of service on their lords , Do well thrive by them . And when they have lined their coats , Do themselves homage . These fellows have some soul ,
Tis poor mad Tom .
And worse I may be yet . The worst is not So long as we can say This is the worst .
Fellow , where goest
Is it a beggarman
Madman and beggar too .
He has some reason , else he could not beg . I th last night’s storm I such a fellow saw , Which made me think a man a worm . My son Came then into my mind , and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him . I have heard more since . As flies to wanton boys are we to th gods . They kill us for their sport .
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night , Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight . And there the snake throws her enameled skin , Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in . And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies . Take thou some of it and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth . Anoint his eyes . But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady . Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on . Effect it with some care , that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love . And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow .
Fear not , my lord . Your servant shall do so .
I humbly thank you . To sue to live , I find I seek to die And , seeking death , find life let it come on .
What , ho Peace here grace and good company
Who’s there come in the wish deserves a welcome .
Dear sir , ere long I’ll visit you again .
Most holy sir , I thank you .
My business is a word or two with Claudio .
And very welcome . Look , signior , here’s your sister .
Provost , a word with you .
As many as you please .
Bring me to hear them speak , where I may be concealed .
Now , sister , what’s the comfort
Why , As all comforts are most good , most good indeed . Lord Angelo , having affairs to heaven , Intends you for his swift ambassador , Where you shall be an everlasting leiger Therefore your best appointment make with speed To morrow you set on .
Is there no remedy
Old John of Gaunt , time honour’d Lancaster , Hast thou , according to thy oath and band , Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son , Here to make good the boisterous late appeal , Which then our leisure would not let us hear , Against the Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Mowbray
I have , my liege .
Tell me , moreover , hast thou sounded him , If he appeal the duke on ancient malice Or worthily , as a good subject should , On some known ground of treachery in him
As near as I could sift him on that argument , On some apparent danger seen in him Aim’d at your highness , no inveterate malice .
Then call them to our presence face to face , And frowning brow to brow , ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak High stomach’d are they both , and full of ire , In rage deaf as the sea , hasty as fire .
Many years of happy days befal My gracious sovereign , my most loving liege
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so . Our house is hell , and thou , a merry devil , Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness . But fare thee well , there is a ducat for thee . And Launcelot , soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo , who is thy new master’s guest . Give him this letter . Do it secretly . And so farewell . I would not have my father See me in talk with thee .
Adieu Tears exhibit my tongue . Most beautiful pagan , most sweet Jew If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee , I am much deceived . But adieu . These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit . Adieu .
Farewell , good Launcelot .
Alack , what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child But though I am a daughter to his blood , I am not to his manners . O Lorenzo , If thou keep promise , I shall end this strife , Become a Christian and thy loving wife .
And by my two faiths and troths , my lord , I spoke mine .
That I love her , I feel .
That she is worthy , I know .
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me . I will die in it at the stake .
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty .
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
That a woman conceived me , I thank her . That she brought me up , I likewise give her most humble thanks . But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick , all women shall pardon me . Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any , I will do myself the right to trust none . And the fine is , for the which I may go the finer , I will live a bachelor .
I shall see thee , ere I die , look pale with love .
With anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love . Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid .
And such a one do I profess myself . For , sir , It is as sure as you are Roderigo , Were I the Moor , I would not be Iago . In following him , I follow but myself . Heaven is my judge , not I for love and duty , But seeming so , for my peculiar end . For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In compliment extern , ’tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at . I am not what I am .
What a full fortune does the Thick lips owe If he can carry’t thus
Call up her father . Rouse him . Make after him , Poison his delight , Proclaim him in the streets . Incense her kinsmen , And , though he in a fertile climate dwell , Plague him with flies . Though that his joy be joy Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t , As it may lose some color .
Here is her father’s house , I’ll call aloud .
Do , with like timorous accent and dire yell As when , by night and negligence , the fire Is spied in populous cities .
What , ho , Brabantio Signior Brabantio , ho
Awake What , ho , Brabantio Thieves Thieves Look to your house , your daughter , and your bags Thieves thieves
Come now , a roundel and a fairy song . Then for the third part of a minute , hence Some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds , Some war with reremice for their leathern wings To make my small elves coats , and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits . Sing me now asleep . Then to your offices and let me rest .
Measureless liar , thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it . Boy O slave Pardon me , lords , ’tis the first time that ever I was forced to scold . Your judgments , my grave lords , Must give this cur the lie and his own notion Who wears my stripes impress’d upon him that Must bear my beating to his grave shall join To thrust the lie unto him .
Peace , both , and hear me speak .
You spotted snakes with double tongue , Thorny hedgehogs , be not seen . Newts and blindworms , do no wrong . Come not near our fairy queen .
Cut me to pieces , Volsces men and lads , Stain all your edges on me . Boy false hound If you have writ your annals true , ’tis there , That , like an eagle in a dove cote , I Flutter’d your Volscians in Corioli Alone I did it . Boy
Why , noble lords , Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune , Which was your shame , by this unholy braggart , ’Fore your own eyes and ears
Philomel , with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby . Lulla , lulla , lullaby , lulla , lulla , lullaby . Never harm Nor spell nor charm Come our lovely lady nigh . So good night , with lullaby .
Let him die for’t .
Weaving spiders , come not here . Hence , you long legged spinners , hence
‘Tear him to pieces . ’ ‘Do it presently . ’ ‘He kill’d my son . ’ ‘My daughter . ’ ‘He killed my cousin Marcus . ’ ‘He killed my father . ’
None , but such remedy as , to save a head , To cleave a heart in twain .
But is there any
Yes , brother , you may live There is a devilish mercy in the judge , If you’ll implore it , that will free your life , But fetter you till death .
Perpetual durance
Ay , just perpetual durance , a restraint , Though all the world’s vastidity you had , To a determined scope .
But in what nature
In such a one as , you consenting to’t , Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear , And leave you naked .
Let me know the point .
O , I do fear thee , Claudio and I quake , Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain , And six or seven winters more respect Than a perpetual honour . Darest thou die The sense of death is most in apprehension And the poor beetle , that we tread upon , In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great As when a giant dies .
How should this be Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow , Angering itself and others . Bless thee , master
Is that the naked fellow
Ay , my lord .
Then prithee , get thee gone . If for my sake Thou wilt o ertake us hence a mile or twain I th way toward Dover , do it for ancient love . And bring some covering for this naked soul , Which I’ll entreat to lead me .
Alack , sir , he is mad .
Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind . Do as I bid thee . Or rather , do thy pleasure . Above the rest , be gone .
I’ll bring him the best parel that I have , Come on ’t what will .
Sirrah , naked fellow
Poor Tom’s a cold . I cannot daub it further .
Come hither , fellow .
And yet I must . Bless thy sweet eyes , they bleed .
Know’st thou the way to Dover
Each day still better other’s happiness Until the heavens , envying earth’s good hap , Add an immortal title to your crown
Why give you me this shame Think you I can a resolution fetch From flowery tenderness If I must die , I will encounter darkness as a bride , And hug it in mine arms .
There spake my brother there my father’s grave Did utter forth a voice . Yes , thou must die Thou art too noble to conserve a life In base appliances . This outward sainted deputy , Whose settled visage and deliberate word Nips youth i’ the head and follies doth emmew As falcon doth the fowl , is yet a devil His filth within being cast , he would appear A pond as deep as hell .
The prenzie Angelo
O , ’tis the cunning livery of hell , The damned’st body to invest and cover In prenzie guards Dost thou think , Claudio If I would yield him my virginity , Thou mightst be freed .
O heavens it cannot be .
Yes , he would give’t thee , from this rank offence , So to offend him still . This night’s the time That I should do what I abhor to name , Or else thou diest to morrow .
We thank you both yet one but flatters us , As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason . Cousin of Hereford , what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Mowbray
First , heaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subject’s love , Tendering the precious safety of my prince , And free from other misbegotten hate , Come I appellant to this princely presence . Now , Thomas Mowbray , do I turn to thee , And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth , Or my divine soul answer it in heaven . Thou art a traitor and a miscreant , Too good to be so and too bad to live , Since the more fair and crystal is the sky , The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly . Once more , the more to aggravate the note , With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat And wish , so please my sovereign , ere I move , What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove .
What is the reason of this terrible summons What is the matter there
Signior , is all your family within
Are your doors locked
Why , wherefore ask you this
Zounds , sir , you’re robbed For shame , put on your gown . Your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul . Even now , now , very now , an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe . Arise , arise , Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you . Arise , I say
What , have you lost your wits
Most reverend signior , do you know my voice
Not I . What are you
My name is Roderigo .
The worser welcome . I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors . In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee . And now in madness , Being full of supper and distempering drafts , Upon malicious knavery dost thou come To start my quiet
Sir , sir , sir
Nay , we will slink away in supper time , Disguise us at my lodging , and return , All in an hour .
We have not made good preparation .
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
Peace , ho no outrage peace The man is noble and his fame folds in This orb o’ the earth . His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing . Stand , Aufidius , And trouble not the peace .
O that I had him , With six Aufidiuses , or more , his tribe , To use my lawful sword
Insolent villain
Kill , kill , kill , kill , kill him
Hold , hold , hold , hold
My noble masters , hear me speak .
O Tullus ,
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep .
Tread not upon him . Masters all , be quiet Put up your swords .
My lords , when you shall know as in this rage , Provoked by him , you cannot the great danger Which this man’s life did owe you , you’ll rejoice That he is thus cut off . Please it your honours To call me to your senate , I’ll deliver Myself your loyal servant , or endure Your heaviest censure .
Both stile and gate , horseway and footpath . Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits . Bless thee , goodman’s son , from the foul fiend Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once of lust , as Obidicut Hobbididence , prince of dumbness Mahu , of stealing Modo , of murder Flibbertigibbet , of mopping and mowing , who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women . So bless thee , master .
Here , take this purse , thou whom the heavens plagues Have humbled to all strokes . That I am wretched Makes thee the happier . Heavens , deal so still . Let the superfluous and lust dieted man , That slaves your ordinance , that will not see Because he doth not feel , feel your power quickly . So distribution should undo excess , And each man have enough . Dost thou know Dover
Ay , master .
Beetles black , approach not near . Worm nor snail , do no offense .
There is a cliff , whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep . Bring me but to the very brim of it , And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me . From that place I shall no leading need .
Philomel , with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby . Lulla , lulla , lullaby , lulla , lulla , lullaby . Never harm Nor spell nor charm Come our lovely lady nigh . So good night , with lullaby .
Give me thy arm . Poor Tom shall lead thee .
Hence , away Now all is well . One aloof stand sentinel .
Tis vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , And better in my mind not undertook .
Tis now but four o clock . We have two hours To furnish us .
Friend Launcelot , what’s the news
An it shall please you to break up this , it shall seem to signify .
I know the hand . In faith , ’tis a fair hand , And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ .
Love news , in faith
By your leave , sir .
Well , if ever thou dost fall from this faith , thou wilt prove a notable argument .
If I do , hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me , and he that hits me , let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam .
Well , as time shall try . In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke .
What thou seest when thou dost wake , Do it for thy true love take . Love and languish for his sake . Be it ounce or cat or bear , Pard or boar with bristled hair , In thy eye that shall appear , When thou wakest , it is thy dear . Wake when some vile thing is near .
Fair love , you faint with wandering in the wood . And to speak troth , I have forgot our way .
The savage bull may , but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it , pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead , and let me be vilely painted , and in such great letters as they write Here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign Here you may see Benedick the married man .
If this should ever happen , thou wouldst be horn mad .
Nay , if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice , thou wilt quake for this shortly .
I look for an earthquake too , then .
Well , you temporize with the hours . In the meantime , good Signior Benedick , repair to Leonato’s . Commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper , for indeed he hath made great preparation .
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage , and so I commit you
Thou shalt not do’t .
O , were it but my life , I’ld throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pin .
Thanks , dear Isabel .
Be ready , Claudio , for your death tomorrow .
Yes . Has he affections in him , That thus can make him bite the law by the nose , When he would force it Sure , it is no sin , Or of the deadly seven , it is the least .
Which is the least
If it were damnable , he being so wise , Why would he for the momentary trick Be perdurably fined O Isabel
What says my brother
Death is a fearful thing .
And shamed life a hateful .
Ay , but to die , and go we know not where To lie in cold obstruction and to rot This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit To bathe in fiery floods , or to reside In thrilling region of thick ribbed ice To be imprison’d in the viewless winds , And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thought Imagine howling ’tis too horrible The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age , ache , penury and imprisonment Can lay on nature is a paradise To what we fear of death .
Welcome , my lord . I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way .
Now , where’s your master
Madam , within but never man so changed . I told him of the army that was landed . He smiled at it . I told him you were coming . His answer was The worse . Of Gloucester’s treachery And of the loyal service of his son , When I informed him , then he called me sot , And told me I had turned the wrong side out . What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him What like , offensive .
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee .
Patience , good sir .
What tell’st thou me of robbing This is Venice , My house is not a grange .
Most grave Brabantio , In simple and pure soul I come to you
Conceive , and fare thee well .
Zounds , sir , you are one of those that will not serve God , if the devil bid you . Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse . You’ll have your nephews neigh to you . You’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
What profane wretch art thou
I am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs .
Thou art a villain
You are a senator
This thou shalt answer . I know thee , Roderigo .
Sir , I will answer any thing . But , I beseech you , If’t be your pleasure and most wise consent that your fair daughter At this odd even and dull watch o th night
We’ll rest us , Hermia , if you think it good . And tarry for the comfort of the day .
Be it so , Lysander . Find you out a bed , For I upon this bank will rest my head .
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both . One heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
Nay , good Lysander . For my sake , my dear , Lie further off yet . Do not lie so near .
O , take the sense , sweet , of my innocence . Love takes the meaning in love’s conference . I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it . Two bosoms interchainèd with an oath So then two bosoms and a single troth . Then by your side no bed room me deny . For , lying so , Hermia , I do not lie .
Lysander riddles very prettily . Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied . But , gentle friend , for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty . Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid . So far be distant . And , good night , sweet friend . Thy love ne er alter till thy sweet life end
Amen , amen to that fair prayer , say I . And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed . Sleep give thee all his rest
Alas , alas
Bear from hence his body And mourn you for him let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his urn .
His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame . Let’s make the best of it .
Sweet sister , let me live What sin you do to save a brother’s life , Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtue .
My rage is gone And I am struck with sorrow . Take him up . Help , three o’ the chiefest soldiers I’ll be one . Beat thou the drum , that it speak mournfully Trail your steel pikes . Though in this city he Hath widow’d and unchilded many a one , Which to this hour bewail the injury , Yet he shall have a noble memory . Assist .
O you beast O faithless coward O dishonest wretch Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice Is’t not a kind of incest , to take life From thine own sister’s shame What should I think Heaven shield my mother play’d my father fair For such a warped slip of wilderness Ne’er issued from his blood . Take my defiance Die , perish Might but my bending down Reprieve thee from thy fate , it should proceed I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death , No word to save thee .
Nay , hear me , Isabel .
O , fie , fie , fie Thy sin’s not accidental , but a trade . Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd ’Tis best thou diest quickly .
O hear me , Isabella
To the tuition of God . From my house , if I had it
The sixth of July . Your loving friend , Benedick .
Nay , mock not , mock not . The body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither . Ere you flout old ends any further , examine your conscience . And so I leave you .
My liege , your highness now may do me good .
My love is thine to teach . Teach it but how , And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good .
Hath Leonato any son , my lord
No child but Hero she’s his only heir . Dost thou affect her , Claudio
O , my lord , When you went onward on this ended action , I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye , That liked but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love . But now I am returned and that war thoughts Have left their places vacant , in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires , All prompting me how fair young Hero is , Saying I liked her ere I went to wars .
Whither goest thou
Marry , sir , to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian .
Hold here , take this . Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her . Speak it privately . Go , gentlemen , Will you prepare you for this masque tonight I am provided of a torchbearer .
Ay , marry , I’ll be gone about it straight .
And so will I .
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence .
Tis good we do so .
Was not that letter from fair Jessica
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal Tis not the trial of a woman’s war , The bitter clamour of two eager tongues , Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hush’d and nought at all to say First , the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had return’d These terms of treason doubled down his throat . Setting aside his high blood’s royalty , And let him be no kinsman to my liege , I do defy him , and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds , And meet him , were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps , Or any other ground inhabitable , Where ever Englishman durst set his foot . Mean time let this defend my loyalty , By all my hopes , most falsely doth he lie .
Pale trembling coward , there I throw my gage , Disclaiming here the kindred of the king , And lay aside my high blood’s royalty , Which fear , not reverence , makes thee to except . If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honour’s pawn , then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else , Will I make good against thee , arm to arm , What I have spoke , or thou canst worse devise .
Vouchsafe a word , young sister , but one word .
What is your will
Might you dispense with your leisure , I would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit .
I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you awhile .
Son , I have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister . Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she , having the truth of honour in her , hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive . I am confessor to Angelo , and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready .
Let me ask my sister pardon . I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it .
Hold you there farewell .
With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed
Through the forest have I gone . But Athenian found I none , On whose eyes I might approve This flower’s force in stirring love . Churl , upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe . When thou wakest , let love forbid Sleep his seat on thy eyelid . So awake when I am gone , For I must now to Oberon .
Stay , though thou kill me , sweet Demetrius .
I charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
Yours in the ranks of death .
O , wilt thou darkling leave me Do not so .
My most dear Gloucester
Oh , the difference of man and man To thee a woman’s services are due . My fool usurps my body .
Madam , here comes my lord .
I have been worth the whistle .
O Goneril , You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face . I fear your disposition . That nature , which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself . She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use .
No more . The text is foolish .
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile . Filths savor but themselves . What have you done Tigers , not daughters , what have you performed A father , and a gracious agèd man , Whose reverence even the head lugged bear would lick , Most barbarous , most degenerate , have you madded .
Transported with no worse nor better guard But with a knave of common hire , a gondolier , To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor , If this be known to you and your allowance , We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs . But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke . Do not believe That , from the sense of all civility , I thus would play and trifle with your reverence . Your daughter I say again , hath made a gross revolt , Tying her duty , beauty , wit , and fortunes In an extravagant and wheeling stranger Of here and everywhere . Straight satisfy yourself . If she be in her chamber or your house , Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you .
Strike on the tinder , ho Give me a taper , call up all my people This accident is not unlike my dream , Belief of it oppresses me already . Light , I say , light
that , for their souls , Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business . In which regard ,
Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words . If thou dost love fair Hero , cherish it , And I will break with her and with her father , And thou shalt have her . Was ’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story
How sweetly you do minister to love , That know love’s grief by his complexion But lest my liking might too sudden seem , I would have salved it with a longer treatise .
What need the bridge much broader than the flood The fairest grant is the necessity . Look what will serve is fit . Tis once , thou lovest , And I will fit thee with the remedy . I know we shall have reveling tonight . I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio , And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale . Then after to her father will I break , And the conclusion is , she shall be thine . In practice let us put it presently .
Provost , a word with you
What’s your will , father
That now you are come , you will be gone . Leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company .
In good time .
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace , being the soul of your complexion , shall keep the body of it ever fair . The assault that Angelo hath made to you , fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and , but that frailty hath examples for his falling , I should wonder at Angelo . How will you do to content this substitute , and to save your brother
I am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born . But , O , how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo If ever he return and I can speak to him , I will open my lips in vain , or discover his government .
Could my good brother suffer you to do it A man , a prince by him so benefited If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offenses , It will come Humanity must perforce prey on itself Like monsters of the deep .
Milk livered man That bear’st a cheek for blows , a head for wrongs Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning Thine honor from thy suffering that not know’st Fools do those villains pity who are punished Ere they have done their mischief . Where’s thy drum France spreads his banners in our noiseless land , With plumèd helm thy state begins to threat , Whiles thou , a moral fool , sits still and cries , Alack , why does he so
See thyself , devil Proper deformity shows not in the fiend So horrid as in woman .
O vain fool
Thou changèd and self covered thing , for shame Bemonster not thy feature . Were ’t my fitness To let these hands obey my blood , They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones . Howe er thou art a fiend , A woman’s shape doth shield thee .
Marry , your manhood , mew
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York , And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried . Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths , Our bruisèd arms hung up for monuments , Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings , Our dreadful marches to delightful measures . Grim visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front And now , instead of mounting barbèd steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries , He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute . But I , that am not shaped for sportive tricks , Nor made to court an amorous looking glass I , that am rudely stamped and want love’s majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph I , that am curtailed of this fair proportion , Cheated of feature by dissembling nature , Deformed , unfinished , sent before my time Into this breathing world , scarce half made up , And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Why , I , in this weak piping time of peace , Have no delight to pass away the time , Unless to see my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity .
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains , Yet for necessity of present life I must show out a flag and sign of love , . That you shall surely find him , Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search , And there will I be with him . So farewell .
It is too true an evil . Gone she is . And what’s to come of my despisèd time Is naught but bitterness . Now , Roderigo , Where didst thou see her Oh , unhappy girl With the Moor , say’st thou Who would be a father How didst thou know ’twas she Oh , she deceives me Past thought What said she to you Get more tapers , Raise all my kindred . Are they married , think you
Truly , I think they are .
Oh , heaven , how got she out Oh , treason of the blood Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters minds By what you see them act . Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused Have you not read , Roderigo , Of some such thing
Yes , sir , I have indeed .
Call up my brother Oh , would you had had her Some one way , some another . Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor
I think I can discover him , if you please To get good guard and go along with me .
I must needs tell thee all . She hath directed How I shall take her from her father’s house , What gold and jewels she is furnished with , What page’s suit she hath in readiness . If e er the Jew her father come to heaven , It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake . And never dare Misfortune cross her foot Unless she do it under this excuse That she is issue to a faithless Jew . Come , go with me . Peruse this as thou goest . Fair Jessica shall be my torchbearer .
Stay , on thy peril . I alone will go .
Oh , I am out of breath in this fond chase . The more my prayer , the lesser is my grace . Happy is Hermia , wheresoe er she lies , For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes . How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears . If so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers . No , no , I am as ugly as a bear , For beasts that meet me run away for fear . Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do , as a monster , fly my presence thus . What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne But who is here Lysander , on the ground Dead or asleep I see no blood , no wound . Lysander , if you live , good sir , awake .
And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake . Transparent Helena Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart . Where is Demetrius Oh , how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword
Do not say so , Lysander . Say not so . What though he love your Hermia Lord , what though Yet Hermia still loves you . Then be content .
Content with Hermia No . I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent . Not Hermia but Helena I love . Who will not change a raven for a dove The will of man is by his reason swayed , And reason says you are the worthier maid .
That shall not be much ami Yet , as the matter now stands , he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only . Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself . I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke , if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business .
Let me hear you speak farther . I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit .
Virtue is bold , and goodness never fearful . Have you not heard speak of Mariana , the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
I have heard of the lady , and good words went with her name .
She should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by oath , and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity , her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea , having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister . But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother , in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him , the portion and sinew of her fortune , her marriage dowry with both , her combinate husband , this well seeming Angelo .
What news
O my good lord , the Duke of Cornwall’s dead , Slain by his servant , going to put out The other eye of Gloucester .
Gloucester’s eyes
A servant that he bred , thrilled with remorse , Opposed against the act , bending his sword To his great master who thereat enraged Flew on him and amongst them felled him dead But not without that harmful stroke , which since Hath plucked him after .
This shows you are above , You justicers , that these our nether crimes So speedily can venge But oh , poor Gloucester Lost he his other eye
Both , both , my lord . This letter , madam , craves a speedy answer . Tis from your sister .
One way I like this well . But being widow , and my Gloucester with her , May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life . Another way The news is not so tart . I’ll read and answer .
I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder , I’ll answer thee in any fair degree , Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount , alive may I not light , If I be traitor or unjustly fight
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him .
Look , what I speak , my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers , The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments , Like a false traitor and injurious villain . Besides I say and will in battle prove , Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was survey’d by English eye , That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring . Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good , That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death , Suggest his soon believing adversaries , And consequently , like a traitor coward , Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood , like sacrificing Abel’s , cries , Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth , To me for justice and rough chastisement And , by the glorious worth of my descent , This arm shall do it , or this life be spent .
Pray you lead on . At every house I’ll call . I may command at most . Get weapons , ho And raise some special officers of might . On , good Roderigo . I will deserve your pains .
How now , brother , where is my cousin , your son Hath he provided this music
Can this be so did Angelo so leave her
He is very busy about it . But , brother , I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
Left her in her tears , and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole , pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few , bestowed her on her own lamentation , which she yet wears for his sake and he , a marble to her tears , is washed with them , but relents not .
Are they good
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world What corruption in this life , that it will let this man live But how out of this can she avail
As the events stamps them , but they have a good cover they show well outward . The Prince and Count Claudio , walking in a thick pleached alley in mine orchard , were thus much overheard by a man of mine the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance , and if he found her accordant , he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it .
It is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother , but keeps you from dishonour in doing it .
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this
Show me how , good father .
A good sharp fellow . I will send for him , and question him yourself .
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness , that in all reason should have quenched her love , hath , like an impediment in the current , made it more violent and unruly . Go you to Angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage , first , that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience . This being granted in course , and now follows all , we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment , go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter , it may compel him to her recompense and here , by this , is your brother saved , your honour untainted , the poor Mariana advantaged , and the corrupt deputy scaled . The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt . If you think well to carry this as you may , the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof . What think you of it
Things growing are not ripe until their season . So I , being young , till now ripe not to reason . And touching now the point of human skill , Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes , where I o erlook Love’s stories written in love’s richest book .
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born When at your hands did I deserve this scorn Is ’t not enough , is ’t not enough , young man , That I did never , no , nor never can , Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye , But you must flout my insufficiency Good troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , In such disdainful manner me to woo . But fare you well . Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness . Oh , that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused
And therefore , since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well spoken days , I am determinèd to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days . Plots have I laid , inductions dangerous , By drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate , the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle , false , and treacherous , This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that G Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be . Dive , thoughts , down to my soul . Here Clarence comes .
She sees not Hermia . Hermia , sleep thou there . And never mayst thou come Lysander near For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings , Or as the heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive , So thou , my surfeit and my heresy , Of all be hated , but the most of me . And all my powers , address your love and might To honor Helen and to be her knight .
Brother , good day . What means this armèd guard That waits upon your Grace
His majesty , Tend ring my person’s safety , hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower .
Upon what cause
Because my name is George .
Alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours . He should , for that , commit your godfathers . O , belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower . But what’s the matter , Clarence May I know
Well , thou shalt see , thy eyes shall be thy judge , The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio . What , Jessica Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me . What , Jessica And sleep and snore , and rend apparel out Why , Jessica , I say
Why , Jessica
Who bids thee call I do not bid thee call .
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding .
Call you What is your will
I am bid forth to supper , Jessica . There are my keys . But wherefore should I go I am not bid for love . They flatter me . But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian . Jessica , my girl , Look to my house . I am right loath to go . There is some ill a brewing towards my rest , For I did dream of money bags tonight .
The image of it gives me content already and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection .
It lies much in your holding up . Haste you speedily to Angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed , give him promise of satisfaction . I will presently to Saint Luke’s there , at the moated grange , resides this dejected Mariana . At that place call upon me and dispatch with Angelo , that it may be quickly .
I thank you for this comfort . Fare you well , good father .
Where was his son when they did take his eyes
Come with my lady hither .
He is not here .
No , my good lord . I met him back again .
Knows he the wickedness
Ay , my good lord . Twas he informed against him , And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course .
Gloucester , I live To thank thee for the love thou showed’st the king , And to revenge thine eyes . Come hither , friend . Tell me what more thou know’st .
Though in the trade of war I have slain men , Yet do I hold it very stuff o th conscience To do no contrived murder . I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service . Nine or ten times I had thought t have yerked him here under the ribs .
Tis better as it is .
Nay , but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That , with the little godliness I have , I did full hard forbear him . But I pray you , sir , Are you fast married Be assured of this That the Magnifico is much beloved And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke’s . He will divorce you , Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law Will give him cable .
Let him do his spite . My services which I have done the signiory Shall out tongue his complaints . Tis yet to know Which , when I know that boasting is an honor , I shall promulgate . I fetch my life and being From men of royal siege , and my demerits May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune As this that I have reached . For know , Iago , But that I love the gentle Desdemona , I would not my unhousèd free condition Put into circumscription and confine For the sea’s worth . But look , what lights come yond
Nay , if there be no remedy for it , but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts , we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastarda pun referring both to types of sweet Spanish wines and to illegitimate childrenbrown and white bastard .
O heavens what stuff is here
’Twas never merry world since , of two usuries , the merriest was put down , and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm and furred with fox and lamb skins too , to signify , that craft , being richer than innocency , stands for the facing .
Come your way , sir . ’Bless you , good father friar .
And you , good brother father . What offence hath this man made you , sir
Marry , sir , he hath offended the law and , sir , we take him to be a thief too , sir for we have found upon him , sir , a strange picklock , which we have sent to the deputy .
Fie , sirrah a bawd , a wicked bawd The evil that thou causest to be done , That is thy means to live . Do thou but think What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back From such a filthy vice say to thyself , From their abominable and beastly touches I drink , I eat , array myself , and live . Canst thou believe thy living is a life , So stinkingly depending Go mend , go mend .
No , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself . But I will acquaint my daughter withal , that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true . Go you and tell her of it .
Those are the raisèd father and his friends . You were best go in .
Not I , I must be found . My parts , my title , and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly . Is it they
By Janus , I think no .
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant The goodness of the night upon you , friends What is the news
The Duke does greet you , general , And he requires your haste post haste appearance , Even on the instant .
What’s the matter , think you
Something from Cyprus as I may divine . It is a business of some heat . The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels , And many of the consuls , raised and met , Are at the Duke’s already . You have been hotly called for . When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out .
Tis well I am found by you . I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you .
Yea , Richard , when I know , for I protest As yet I do not . But , as I can learn , He hearkens after prophecies and dreams , And from the crossrow plucks the letter G , And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be . And for my name of George begins with G , It follows in his thought that I am he . These , as I learn , and such like toys as these Have moved his Highness to commit me now .
Why , this it is when men are ruled by women . Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower . My Lady Grey his wife , Clarence , ’tis she That tempers him to this extremity . Was it not she and that good man of worship , Anthony Woodeville , her brother there , That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower , From whence this present day he is delivered We are not safe , Clarence . We are not safe .
Cousins , you know what you have to do . O , I cry you mercy , friend . Go you with me and I will use your skill . Good cousin , have a care this busy time .
By heaven , I think there is no man is secure But the queen’s kindred and night walking heralds That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore . Heard ye not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery
Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty . I’ll tell you what I think it is our way , If we will keep in favor with the king , To be her men and wear her livery . The jealous o erworn widow and herself , Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen , Are mighty gossips in this monarchy .
I beseech you , sir , go . My young master doth expect your reproach .
So do I his .
And they have conspired together . I will not say you shall see a masque , but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on Black Monday last at six o clock i th morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th afternoon .
What , are there masques Hear you me , Jessica . Lock up my doors , and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry necked fife , Clamber not you up to the casements then , Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces . But stop my house’s ears I mean my casements Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house . By Jacob’s staff , I swear , I have no mind of feasting forth tonight . But I will go . Go you before me , sirrah . Say I will come .
I will go before , sir . Mistress , look out at window , for all this . There will come a Christian by Will be worth a Jewess eye .
Help me , Lysander , help me Do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast . Ay me , for pity What a dream was here . Lysander , look how I do quake with fear . Methought a serpent eat my heart away , And you sat smiling at his cruel pray . Lysander What , removed Lysander , lord What , out of hearing , gone No sound , no word Alack , where are you Speak , an if you hear . Speak , of all loves I swoon almost with fear . No Then I well perceive you all not nigh . Either death or you I’ll find immediately .
Indeed , it does stink in some sort , sir but yet , sir , I would prove
How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk , what say’st thou to this
Nay , if the devil have given thee proofs for sin , Thou wilt prove his . Take him to prison , officer Correction and instruction must both work Ere this rude beast will profit .
O , let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf , Till I have told this slander of his blood , How God and good men hate so foul a liar .
He must before the deputy , sir he has given him warning the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremonger , and comes before him , he were as good go a mile on his errand .
That we were all , as some would seem to be , From our faults , as faults from seeming , free
Mowbray , impartial are our eyes and ears Were he my brother , nay , my kingdom’s heir , As he is but my father’s brother’s son , Now , by my sceptre’s awe , I make a vow , Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him , nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject , Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allow .
His neck will come to your waist’ a cord , sir .
I spy comfort I cry bail . Here’s a gentleman and a friend of mine .
Then , Bolingbroke , as low as to thy heart , Through the false passage of thy throat , thou liest . Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers The other part reserved I by consent , For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account , Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie . For Gloucester’s death , I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case . For you , my noble Lord of Lancaster , The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life , A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it , and exactly begg’d Your grace’s pardon , and I hope I had it . This is my fault as for the rest appeall’d , It issues from the rancour of a villain , A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitor’s foot , To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chamber’d in his bosom . In haste whereof , most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day .
How now , noble Pompey What , at the wheels of Caesar art thou led in triumph What , is there none of Pygmalion’s images , newly made woman , to be had now , for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch’d What reply , ha What sayest thou to this tune , matter and method Is’t not drowned i’ the last rain , ha What sayest thou , Trot Is the world as it was , man Which is the way Is it sad , and few words or how The trick of it
Ancient , what makes he here
Faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack . If it prove lawful prize , he’s made for ever .
I do not understand .
He’s married .
To who
Marry , to
Come , captain , will you go
Have with you .
What the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad
Here comes another troop to seek for you .
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds . Therefore the sadness is without limit .
It is Brabantio . General , be advised , He comes to bad intent .
You should hear reason .
Holla Stand there
And when I have heard it , what blessing brings it
Signior , it is the Moor .
If not a present remedy , at least a patient sufferance .
Down with him , thief
I wonder that thou , being , as thou sayst thou art , born under Saturn , goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief . I cannot hide what I am . I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no man’s jests , eat when I have stomach and wait for no man’s leisure , sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no man’s business , laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humor .
Yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment . You have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself . It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me . His majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference , Of what degree soever , with his brother .
Even so . An please your Worship , Brakenbury , You may partake of anything we say . We speak no treason , man . We say the king Is wise and virtuous , and his noble queen Well struck in years , fair , and not jealous . We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot , A cherry lip , a bonny eye , a passing pleasing tongue , And that the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks . How say you , sir Can you deny all this
With this , my lord , myself have naught to do .
Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee , fellow , He that doth naught with her , excepting one , Were best he do it secretly , alone .
What one , my lord
Her husband , knave . Wouldst thou betray me
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me , and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke .
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason
Something he left imperfect in the state which , since his coming forth , is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary .
Who hath he left behind him general
The Marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief
Ay , sir . She took them , read them in my presence , And now and then an ample tear trilled down Her delicate cheek . It seemed she was a queen Over her passion , who , most rebel like , Sought to be king o er her .
O , then it moved her
Not to a rage . Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest . You have seen Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears Were like a better way . Those happy smilets That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know What guests were in her eyes , which parted thence As pearls from diamonds dropped . In brief , Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it .
You , Roderigo Come , sir , I am for you .
Keep up your bright swords , for the dew will rust them . Good signior , you shall more command with years Than with your weapons .
O thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter Damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her For I’ll refer me to all things of sense , If she in chains of magic were not bound , Whether a maid so tender , fair , and happy , So opposite to marriage that she shunned The wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation , Would ever have , t incur a general mock , Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou to fear , not to delight . Judge me the world if ’tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms , Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion . I’ll have ’t disputed on . Tis probable and palpable to thinking . I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world , a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant . Lay hold upon him . If he do resist , Subdue him at his peril
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any . In this , though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but I am a plain dealing villain . I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage . If I had my mouth , I would bite if I had my liberty , I would do my liking . In the meantime , let me be that I am , and seek not to alter me .
Can you make no use of your discontent
Hold your hands , Both you of my inclining and the rest . Were it my cue to fight , I should have known it Without a prompter . Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge
I make all use of it , for I use it only . Who comes here
Wrath kindled gentlemen , be ruled by me Let’s purge this choler without letting blood This we prescribe , though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget , forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed . Good uncle , let this end where it begun We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk , you your son .
To be a make peace shall become my age Throw down , my son , the Duke of Norfolk’s gage .
What news , Borachio
And , Norfolk , throw down his .
I came yonder from a great supper . The Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato , and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage .
When , Harry , when Obedience bids I should not bid again .
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness
Norfolk , throw down , we bid there is no boot .
Marry , it is your brother’s right hand .
Myself I throw , dread sovereign , at thy foot . My life thou shalt command , but not my shame The one my duty owes but my fair name , Despite of death that lives upon my grave , To dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have . I am disgraced , impeach’d and baffled here , Pierced to the soul with slander’s venom’d spear , The which no balm can cure but his heart blood Which breathed this poison .
Who The most exquisite Claudio
Even he .
What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring , ha
His words were , Farewell , mistress . Nothing else .
Still thus , and thus still worse
How doth my dear morsel , thy mistress Procures she still , ha
Troth , sir , she hath eaten up all her beef , and she is herself in the tub beef can mean actual meat or prostitutes tub can mean a pickling tub for curing meat , or a sweat tub to treat venereal disease . she hath eaten up all her beef , and she is herself in the tub .
Why , ’tis good it is the right of it it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd an unshunned consequence it must be so . Art going to prison , Pompey
Yes , faith , sir .
Why , ’tis not amiss , Pompey . Farewell go , say I sent thee thither . For debt , Pompey or how
For being a bawd , for being a bawd .
Well , then , imprison him if imprisonment be the due of a bawd , why , ’tis his right bawd is he doubtless , and of antiquity too bawd born . Farewell , good Pompey . Commend me to the prison , Pompey you will turn good husband now , Pompey you will keep the house .
I hope , sir , your good worship will be my bail .
No , indeed , will I not , Pompey it is not the wear . I will pray , Pompey , to increase your bondage If you take it not patiently , why , your mettle is the more . Adieu , trusty Pompey . ’Bless you , friar .
Are we all met
Pat , pat . And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal . This green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn brake our tiring house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .
Peter Quince
What sayest thou , bully Bottom
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please . First , Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies cannot abide . How answer you that
By r lakin , a parlous fear .
I believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
Not a whit . I have a device to make all well . Write me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords , and that Pyramus is not killed indeed . And for the more better assurance , tell them that I , Pyramus , am not Pyramus , but Bottom the weaver . This will put them out of fear .
We know thy charge , Brakenbury , and will obey .
We are the queen’s abjects and must obey . Brother , farewell . I will unto the king , And whatsoe er you will employ me in , Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister , I will perform it to enfranchise you . Meantime , this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine .
I know it pleaseth neither of us well .
Well , your imprisonment shall not be long . I will deliver you or else lie for you . Meantime , have patience .
I must perforce . Farewell .
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne er return . Simple , plain Clarence , I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven , If heaven will take the present at our hands . But who comes here The new delivered Hastings
The patch is kind enough , but a huge feeder , Snail slow in profit , and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat . Drones hive not with me . Therefore I part with him , and part with him To one that would have him help to waste His borrowed purse . Well , Jessica , go in . Perhaps I will return immediately . Do as I bid you . Shut doors after you . Fast bind , fast find . A proverb never stale in thrifty mind .
Farewell , and if my fortune be not crost , I have a father , you a daughter , lost .
To prison , till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer .
What if I do obey How may the Duke be therewith satisfied , Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him
Tis true , most worthy signior . The Duke’s in council and your noble self , I am sure , is sent for .
How The Duke in council In this time of the night Bring him away . Mine’s not an idle cause . The Duke himself , Or any of my brothers of the state , Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own . For if such actions may have passage free , Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
A proper squire . And who , and who Which way looks he
Marry , on Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
A very forward March chick How came you to this
Being entertained for a perfumer , as I was smoking a musty room , comes me the Prince and Claudio , hand in hand , in sad conference . I whipped me behind the arras , and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself , and having obtained her , give her to Count Claudio .
Come , come , let us thither . This may prove food to my displeasure . That young start up hath all the glory of my overthrow . If I can cross him any way , I bless myself every way . You are both sure , and will assist me
To the death , my lord .
Let us to the great supper . Their cheer is the greater that I am subdued . Would the cook were o my mind Shall we go prove what’s to be done
We’ll wait upon your lordship .
Good time of day unto my gracious lord .
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain . Well are you welcome to the open air . How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment
Well . We will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
No , make it two more . Let it be written in eight and eight .
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
I fear it , I promise you .
Masters , you ought to consider with yourselves . To bring in God shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing . For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living . And we ought to look to ’t .
And you .
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
Does Bridget paint still , Pompey , ha
Come your ways , sir come .
Nay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck . And he himself must speak through , saying thus or to the same defect Ladies , or Fair ladies , I would wish you or I would request you or I would entreat you not to fear , not to tremble , my life for yours . If you think I come hither as a lion , it were pity of my life . No , I am no such thing . I am a man as other men are . And there indeed let him name his name , and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner .
You will not bail me , then , sir
Well , it shall be so . But there is two hard things that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber . For , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
Then , Pompey , nor now . What news abroad , friar what news
Come your ways , sir come .
Go to kennel , Pompey go .
What news , friar , of the duke
I know none . Can you tell me of any
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some , he is in Rome but where is he , think you
I know not where but wheresoever , I wish him well .
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state , and usurp the beggary he was never born to . Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to ’t .
He does well in ’t .
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way , friar .
It is too general a vice , and severity must cure it .
Yes , in good sooth , the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite , friar , till eating and drinking be put down . They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true , think you
There’s no composition in this news That gives them credit .
Indeed , they are disproportioned . My letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
And mine a hundred and forty .
Was not Count John here at supper
I saw him not .
And mine , two hundred . But though they jump not on a just account As in these cases , where the aim reports Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet , and bearing up to Cyprus .
How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after .
Nay , it is possible enough to judgment . I do not so secure me in the error , But the main article I do approve In fearful sense .
He is of a very melancholy disposition .
What , ho , what , ho , what , ho
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick . The one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady’s eldest son , evermore tattling .
A messenger from the galleys .
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth , and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face
Now , what’s the business
With a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .
By my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes , So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo .
In faith , she’s too curst .
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand .
His hour is almost past .
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour , For lovers ever run before the clock .
Oh , ten times faster Venus pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont To keep obligèd faith unforfeited .
That ever holds . Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first All things that are , Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed . How like a younger or a prodigal The scarfèd bark puts from her native bay , Hugged and embraèd by the strumpet wind How like the prodigal doth she return , With overweathered ribs and ragged sails Lean , rent , and beggared by the strumpet wind
Here comes Lorenzo . More of this hereafter .
Rage must be withstood Give me his gage lions make leopards tame .
Yea , but not change his spots take but my shame . And I resign my gage . My dear dear lord , The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation that away , Men are but gilded loam or painted clay . A jewel in a ten times barr’d up chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast . Mine honour is my life both grow in one Take honour from me , and my life is done Then , dear my liege , mine honour let me try In that I live and for that will I die .
Cousin , throw up your gage do you begin .
O , God defend my soul from such deep sin Shall I seem crest fall’n in my father’s sight Or with pale beggar fear impeach my height Before this out dared dastard Ere my tongue Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong , Or sound so base a parle , my teeth shall tear The slavish motive of recanting fear , And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace , Where shame doth harbour , even in Mowbray’s face .
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play
A calendar , a calendar Look in the almanac . Find out moonshine , find out moonshine
Yes , it doth shine that night .
Why then , may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open , and the moon may shine in at the casement .
Ay . Or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern , and say he comes to disfigure , or to present , the person of Moonshine . Then , there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber . For Pyramus and Thisbe , says the story , did talk through the chink of a wall .
You can never bring in a wall . What say you , Bottom
Some man or other must present Wall . And let him have some plaster , or some loam , or some roughcast about him to signify wall . And let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper .
If that may be then all is well . Come , sit down , every mother’s son , and rehearse your parts . Pyramus , you begin . When you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake . And so everyone according to his cue .
Made she no verbal question
Faith , once or twice she heaved the name of father Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart , Cried , Sisters , sisters Shame of ladies , sisters Kent , father , sisters What , i th storm , i th night Let pity not be believed . There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes , And clamor moistened . Then away she started To deal with grief alone .
It is the stars , The stars above us , govern our conditions . Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues . You spoke not with her since
No .
Was this before the king returned
No , since .
Well , sir , the poor distressèd Lear’s i th town , Who sometime in his better tune remembers What we are come about , and by no means Will yield to see his daughter .
Why , good sir
A sovereign shame so elbows him . His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties , gave her dear rights To his dog hearted daughters . These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia .
How say you by this change
This cannot be , By no assay of reason . Tis a pageant , To keep us in false gaze . When we consider Th importancy of Cyprus to the Turk , And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it , For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks th abilities That Rhodes is dressed in . If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskillful To leave that latest which concerns him first , Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless .
Nay , in all confidence , he’s not for Rhodes .
Here is more news .
The Ottomites , reverend and gracious , Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes , Have there injointed them with an after fleet .
Ay , so I thought . How many , as you guess
Of thirty sail . And now they do re stem Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus . Signior Montano , Your trusty and most valiant servitor , With his free duty recommends you thus , And prays you to believe him .
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must . But I shall live , my lord , to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment .
No doubt , no doubt and so shall Clarence too , For they that were your enemies are his And have prevailed as much on him as you .
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty .
What news abroad
No news so bad abroad as this at home The king is sickly , weak and melancholy , And his physicians fear him mightily .
Now , by Saint Paul , that news is bad indeed . O , he hath kept an evil diet long , And overmuch consumed his royal person . Tis very grievous to be thought upon . Where is he , in his bed
He is .
Go you before , and I will follow you .
Too curst is more than curst . I shall lessen God’s sending that way , for it is said , God sends a curst cow short horns , but to a cow too curst , he sends none .
So , by being too curst , God will send you no horns .
Just , if he send me no husband , for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening . Lord , I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woolen .
You may light on a husband that hath no beard .
What should I do with him Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a youth , and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me , and he that is less than a man , I am not for him . Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd , and lead his apes into hell .
Well then , go you into hell
No , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , Get you to heaven , Beatrice , get you to heaven here’s no place for you maids . So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter . For the heavens , he shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long .
How should he be made , then
Some report a sea maid spawned him some , that he was begot between two stock fishes . But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that I know to be true and he is a motion generative that’s infallible .
You are pleasant , sir , and speak apace .
Why , what a ruthless thing is this in him , for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man Would the duke that is absent have done this Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards , he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service , and that instructed him to mercy .
I never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way .
O , sir , you are deceived .
’Tis not possible .
Who , not the duke yes , your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish the duke had crotchets in him . He would be drunk too that let me inform you .
You do him wrong , surely .
What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , So near the cradle of the fairy queen What , a play toward I’ll be an auditor . An actor too , perhaps , if I see cause .
Speak , Pyramus . Thisbe , stand forth .
Thisbe , the flowers of odious savors sweet
Odors , odors .
odors savors sweet , So hath thy breath , my dearest Thisbe dear . And by and by I will to thee appear . But hark , a voice Stay thou but here awhile ,
A stranger Pyramus than e er played here .
Must I speak now
Ay , marry , must you . For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .
Most radiant Pyramus , most lily white of hue , Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier , Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew , As true as truest horse that yet would never tire . I’ll meet thee , Pyramus , at Ninny’s tomb .
Sweet friends , your patience for my long abode . Not I but my affairs have made you wait . When you shall please to play the thieves for wives , I’ll watch as long for you then . Approach . Here dwells my father Jew . Ho Who’s within
Who are you Tell me for more certainty , Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue .
Lorenzo , and thy love .
Lorenzo certain , and my love indeed For who love I so much And now who knows But you , Lorenzo , whether I am yours
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
Here , catch this casket . It is worth the pains . I am glad ’tis night , you do not look on me , For I am much ashamed of my exchange . But love is blind , and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit , For if they could Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformèd to a boy .
Descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
What , must I hold a candle to my shames They in themselves , good sooth , are too too light . Why , ’tis an office of discovery , love . And I should be obscured .
Tis certain then for Cyprus . Marcus Luccicos , is not he in town
He’s now in Florence .
Write from us to him . Post post haste , dispatch .
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor .
Valiant Othello , we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman I did not see you . Welcome , gentle signior . We lacked your counsel and your help tonight .
So did I yours . Good your grace , pardon me . Neither my place nor aught I heard of business Hath raised me from my bed , nor doth the general care Take hold on me , for my particular grief Is of so flood gate and o erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows And it is still itself .
Why , what’s the matter
My daughter Oh , my daughter
Dead
Ay , to me . She is abused , stol n from me , and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks .
Well , niece , I trust you will be ruled by your father .
Yes , faith , it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say , Father , as it please you . But yet for all that , cousin , let him be a handsome fellow , or else make another curtsy and say , Father , as it please me .
Well , niece , I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband .
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth . Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl No , uncle , I’ll none . Adam’s sons are my brethren , and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred .
Daughter , remember what I told you . If the Prince do solicit you in that kind , you know your answer .
The fault will be in the music , cousin , if you be not wooed in good time . If the Prince be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer . For hear me , Hero , wooing , wedding , and repenting is as a Scotch jig , a measure , and a cinquepace . The first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig , and full as fantastical the wedding , mannerly modest as a measure , full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance , and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave .
Sir , I was an inward of his . A shy fellow was the duke and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing .
What , I prithee , might be the cause
No , pardon ’tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this I can let you understand , the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise .
Wise why , no question but he was .
A very superficial , ignorant , unweighing fellow .
Either this is the envy in you , folly , or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation . Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth , and he shall appear to the envious a scholar , a statesman and a soldier . Therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice .
Sir , I know him , and I love him .
Love talks with better knowledge , and knowledge with dearer love .
Come , sir , I know what I know .
I can hardly believe that , since you know not what you speak . But , if ever the duke return , as our prayers are he may , let me desire you to make your answer before him . If it be honest you have spoke , you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call upon you and , I pray you , your name
Ninus tomb , man . Why , you must not speak that yet . That you answer to Pyramus . You speak all your part at once , cues and all . Pyramus , enter . Your cue is past . It is never tire .
Oh . As true as truest horse that yet would never tire .
If I were fair , Thisbe , I were only thine .
Oh , monstrous Oh , strange We are haunted . Pray , masters Fly , masters Help
Alack , poor gentleman
I’ll follow you . I’ll lead you about a round Through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier . Sometime a horse I’ll be , sometime a hound , A hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire . And neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , Like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .
Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not
Tis so . They are afoot .
Why do they run away This is a knavery of them to make me afeard .
Well , sir , I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him . Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile . When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance . I pray you , go Along with me .
For nature so prepost rously to err , Being not deficient , blind , or lame of sense , Sans witchcraft could not .
Whoe er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her , the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter , After your own sense , yea , though our proper son Stood in your action .
Humbly I thank your grace . Here is the man , this Moor , whom now it seems , Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought .
We are very sorry for’t .
What , in your own part , can you say to this
Nothing , but this is so .
Most potent , grave , and reverend signiors , My very noble and approved good masters , That I have ta en away this old man’s daughter , It is most true . True , I have married her . The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent , no more . Rude am I in my speech , And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace , For since these arms of mine had seven years pith Till now some nine moons wasted , they have used Their dearest action in the tented field , And little of this great world can I speak ,
He cannot live , I hope , and must not die Till George be packed with post horse up to heaven . I’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence With lies well steeled with weighty arguments , And , if I fail not in my deep intent , Clarence hath not another day to live Which done , God take King Edward to His mercy , And leave the world for me to bustle in . For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter . What though I killed her husband and her father The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father The which will I , not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto . But yet I run before my horse to market . Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns . When they are gone , then must I count my gains .
Cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
I have a good eye , uncle . I can see a church by daylight .
The revelers are entering , brother . Make good room .
Lady , will you walk a bout with your friend
So you walk softly , and look sweetly , and say nothing , I am yours for the walk , and especially when I walk away .
With me in your company
I may say so when I please .
And when please you to say so
When I like your favor , for God defend the lute should be like the case
My visor is Philemon’s roof within the house is Jove .
We were not born to sue , but to command Which since we cannot do to make you friends , Be ready , as your lives shall answer it , At Coventry , upon Saint Lambert’s day There shall your swords and lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate Since we can not atone you , we shall see Justice design the victor’s chivalry . Lord marshal , command our officers at arms Be ready to direct these home alarms .
O Bottom , thou art changed What do I see on thee
What do you see You see an ass head of your own , do you
Sir , my name is Lucio well known to the duke .
He shall know you better , sir , if I may live to report you .
I fear you not .
Bless thee , Bottom , bless thee . Thou art translated .
O , you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite . But indeed I can do you little harm you’ll forswear this again .
I’ll be hanged first thou art deceived in me , friar . But no more of this . Canst thou tell if Claudio die to morrow or no
I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me , to fright me if they could . But I will not stir from this place , do what they can . I will walk up and down here and I will sing , that they shall hear I am not afraid . The ouzel cock , so black of hue With orange tawny bill , The throstle with his note so true , The wren with little quill
Why should he die , sir
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed
The finch , the sparrow , and the lark , The plainsong cuckoo gray , Whose note full many a man doth mark And dares not answer Nay
Why For filling a bottle with a tundish . I would the duke we talk of were returned again the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house eaves , because they are lecherous . The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned Marry , this Claudio is condemned for untrussing . Farewell , good friar I prithee , pray for me . The duke , I say to thee again , would eat mutton on Fridays . He’s not past it yet , and I say to thee , he would mouth with a beggar , though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that I said so . Farewell .
So are you , sweet , Even in the lovely garnish of a boy . But come at once , For the close night doth play the runaway , And we are stayed for at Bassanio’s feast .
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats , and be with you straight .
Now , by my hood , a gentle and no Jew .
Beshrew me but I love her heartily . For she is wise , if I can judge of her . And fair she is , if that mine eyes be true . And true she is , as she hath proved herself . And therefore , like herself wise , fair and true Shall she be placèd in my constant soul .
What , art thou come On , gentlemen , away Our masquing mates by this time for us stay .
Who’s there
Signor Antonio
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle , And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself . Yet , by your gracious patience , I will a round unvarnished tale deliver Of my whole course of love . What drugs , what charms , What conjuration and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter .
A maiden never bold , Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself . And she , in spite of nature , Of years , of country , credit , everything , To fall in love with what she feared to look on It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err . Against all rules of nature , and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be . I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o er the blood Or with some dram , conjured to this effect , He wrought upon her .
Alack , ’tis he . Why , he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea , singing aloud , Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow weeds , With burdocks , hemlock , nettles , cuckoo flowers , Darnel , and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn . A century send forth . Search every acre in the high grown field , And bring him to our eye .
To vouch this is no proof , Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him .
But , Othello , speak . Did you by indirect and forcèd courses Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth
I do beseech you , Send for the lady to the Sagittary ,
Why , then , your visor should be thatched .
Speak low if you speak love .
Well , I would you did like me .
So would not I for your own sake , for I have many ill qualities .
Which is one
I say my prayers aloud .
I love you the better the hearers may cry Amen .
God match me with a good dancer
Amen .
What can man’s wisdom In the restoring his bereavèd sense He that helps him take all my outward worth .
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done Answer , clerk .
No more words . The clerk is answered .
There is means , madam . Our foster nurse of nature is repose , The which he lacks that to provoke in him Are many simples operative , whose power Will close the eye of anguish .
I know you well enough . You are Signor Antonio .
At a word , I am not .
All blessed secrets , All you unpublished virtues of the earth , Spring with my tears . Be aidant and remediate In the good man’s distress . Seek , seek for him , Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it .
I know you by the waggling of your head .
News , madam . The British powers are marching hitherward .
For indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird Who would give a bird the lie , though he cry cuckoo never so
I pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again . Mine ear is much enamored of thy note . So is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape . And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me On the first view to say , to swear , I love thee .
Methinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that . And yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays . The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends . Nay , I can gleek upon occasion .
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
Not so , neither . But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood , I have enough to serve mine own turn .
Out of this wood do not desire to go . Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . I am a spirit of no common rate . The summer still doth tend upon my state . And I do love thee . Therefore go with me . I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee . And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep , And sing while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep . And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go . Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed
Set down , set down your honorable load , If honor may be shrouded in a hearse , Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster .
Poor key cold figure of a holy king , Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster , Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood , Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost To hear the lamentations of poor Anne , Wife to thy Edward , to thy slaughtered son , Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds . Lo , in these windows that let forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes . O , cursèd be the hand that made these holes Cursèd the heart that had the heart to do it Cursèd the blood that let this blood from hence . More direful hap betide that hated wretch That makes us wretched by the death of thee Than I can wish to wolves , to spiders , toads , Or any creeping venomed thing that lives . If ever he have child , abortive be it , Prodigious , and untimely brought to light , Whose ugly and unnatural aspect May fright the hopeful mother at the view , And that be heir to his unhappiness .
No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure ’scape back wounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes . What king so strong Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue But who comes here
Go away with her to prison
Good my lord , be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord .
Double and treble admonition , and still forfeit in the same kind This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant .
A bawd of eleven years’ continuance , may it please your honour .
My lord , this is one Lucio’s information against me . Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the duke’s time he promised her marriage his child is a year and a quarter old , come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
That fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be called before us . Away with her to prison Go to no more words .
To tell you true , I counterfeit him .
You could never do him so ill well unless you were the very man . Here’s his dry hand up and down . You are he , you are he .
At a word , I am not .
Come , come , do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit Can virtue hide itself Go to , mum , you are he . Graces will appear , and there’s an end .
Will you not tell me who told you so
No , you shall pardon me .
Nor will you not tell me who you are
Not now .
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales Well this was Signor Benedick that said so .
What’s he
I am sure you know him well enough .
Ready .
Not I , believe me .
And I .
And I .
Did he never make you laugh
And I .
Where shall we go
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman . Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes . Feed him with apricoks and dewberries , With purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries . The honey bags steal from the humble bees , And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glowworms eyes To have my love to bed and to arise . And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes . Nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
Hail , mortal .
Hail .
And let her speak of me before her father . If you do find me foul in her report The trust , the office I do hold of you , Not only take away , but let your sentence Even fall upon my life .
Hail .
Hail .
Fetch Desdemona hither .
I cry your worships mercy , heartily . I beseech your worship’s name .
Ancient , conduct them . You best know the place .
And till she come , as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I’ll present How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love And she in mine .
Say it , Othello .
Alas , the part I had in Woodstock’s blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims , To stir against the butchers of his life But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct , Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven Who , when they see the hours ripe on earth , Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads .
Her father loved me , oft invited me , Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , That I have passed . I ran it through , even from my boyish days , To th very moment that he bade me tell it , Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances , Of moving accidents by flood and field , Of hair breadth ’scapes i th imminent deadly breach , Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery , of my redemption thence And portance in my traveler’s history . Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle , Rough quarries , rocks , hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speak such was my process And of the Cannibals that each others eat ,
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur Hath love in thy old blood no living fire Edward’s seven sons , whereof thyself art one , Were as seven vials of his sacred blood , Or seven fair branches springing from one root Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course , Some of those branches by the Destinies cut But Thomas , my dear lord , my life , my Gloucester , One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood , One flourishing branch of his most royal root , Is crack’d , and all the precious liquor spilt , Is hack’d down , and his summer leaves all faded , By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe . Ah , Gaunt , his blood was thine that bed , that womb , That metal , that self mould , that fashion’d thee Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest , Yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent In some large measure to thy father’s death , In that thou seest thy wretched brother die , Who was the model of thy father’s life . Call it not patience , Gaunt it is despair In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter’d , Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life , Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee That which in mean men we intitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts . What shall I say to safeguard thine own life , The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death .
If ever he have wife , let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee . Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load , Taken from Paul’s to be interrèd there .
And still , as you are weary of this weight , Rest you , whiles I lament King Henry’s corse .
Stay , you that bear the corse , and set it down .
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds
Villains , set down the corse or , by Saint Paul , I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys .
Fie , fie , Gratiano Where are all the rest Tis nine o clock . Our friends all stay for you . No masque tonight . The wind is come about . Bassanio presently will go aboard . I have sent twenty out to seek for you .
My lord , stand back and let the coffin pass .
I am glad on ’t . I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight .
Unmannered dog , stand thou when I command Advance thy halberd higher than my breast , Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot And spurn upon thee , beggar , for thy boldness .
Tis known before . Our preparation stands In expectation of them . O dear father , It is thy business that I go about . Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied . No blown ambition doth our arms incite , But love dear love and our aged father’s right . Soon may I hear and see him .
Cobweb .
I shall desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Cobweb . If I cut my finger , I shall make bold with you . Your name , honest gentleman
Peaseblossom .
I pray you , what is he
I pray you , commend me to Mistress Squash , your mother , and to Master Peascod , your father . Good Master Peaseblossom , I shall desire you of more acquaintance too . Your name , I beseech you , sir
Why , he is the Prince’s jester , a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders . None but libertines delight in him , and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy , for he both pleases men and angers them , and then they laugh at him and beat him . I am sure he is in the fleet . I would he had boarded me .
Mustardseed .
When I know the gentleman , I’ll tell him what you say .
Good Master Mustardseed , I know your patience well . That same cowardly , giantlike ox beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house . I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now . I desire you of more acquaintance , good Master Mustardseed .
Do , do . He’ll but break a comparison or two on me , which , peradventure not marked or not laughed at , strikes him into melancholy , and then there’s a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night .
Come , wait upon him . Lead him to my bower . The moon methinks looks with a watery eye . And when she weeps , weeps every little flower , Lamenting some enforcèd chastity . Tie up my love’s tongue . Bring him silently .
We must follow the leaders .
In every good thing .
Nay , if they lead to any ill , I will leave them at the next turning .
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero , and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it . The ladies follow her , and but one visor remains .
The Anthropophagi , and men whose heads Grew beneath their shoulders . These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline . But still the house affairs would draw her hence , Which ever as she could with haste dispatch , She’d come again , and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse , which I , observing , Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate , Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively . I did consent , And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffered . My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs . She swore , in faith , ’twas strange , ’twas passing strange , Twas pitiful , ’twas wondrous pitiful . She wished she had not heard it , yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man . She thanked me And bade me , if I had a friend that loved her , I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her . Upon this hint I spake . She loved me for the dangers I had passed , And I loved her that she did pity them . This only is the witchcraft I have used . Here comes the lady . Let her witness it .
I think this tale would win my daughter too . Good Brabantio . Take up this mangled matter at the best . Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands .
What , do you tremble Are you all afraid Alas , I blame you not , for you are mortal , And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil . Avaunt , thou dreadful minister of hell . Thou hadst but power over his mortal body His soul thou canst not have . Therefore begone .
Sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
Foul devil , for God’s sake , hence , and trouble us not , For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell , Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims . If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , Behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
O , gentlemen , see , see dead Henry’s wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh Blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells . Thy deeds , inhuman and unnatural , Provokes this deluge most unnatural . O God , which this blood mad’st , revenge his death O earth , which this blood drink’st revenge his death Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead , Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood , Which his hell governed arm hath butcherèd
Provost , my brother Angelo will not be altered Claudio must die to morrow let him be furnished with divines , and have all charitable preparation . if my brother wrought by my pity , it should not be so with him .
So please you , this friar hath been with him , and advised him for the entertainment of death .
Good even , good father .
Bliss and goodness on you
Of whence are you
Not of this country , though my chance is now To use it for my time I am a brother Of gracious order , late come from the See In special business from his holiness .
What news abroad i’ the world
None , but that there is so great a fever on goodness , that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course , as it is virtuous to be inconstant in any undertaking . There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world . This news is old enough , yet it is every day’s news . I pray you , sir , of what disposition was the duke
God’s is the quarrel for God’s substitute , His deputy anointed in His sight , Hath caused his death the which if wrongfully , Let heaven revenge for I may never lift An angry arm against His minister .
Where then , alas , may I complain myself
To God , the widow’s champion and defence .
I wonder if Titania be awaked . Then , what it was that next came in her eye , Which she must dote on in extremity .
Why , then , I will . Farewell , old Gaunt . Thou goest to Coventry , there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight O , sit my husband’s wrongs on Hereford’s spear , That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast Or , if misfortune miss the first career , Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom , They may break his foaming courser’s back , And throw the rider headlong in the lists , A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford Farewell , old Gaunt thy sometimes brother’s wife With her companion grief must end her life .
Here comes my messenger . How now , mad spirit What night rule now about this haunted grove
Sister , farewell I must to Coventry As much good stay with thee as go with me
My mistress with a monster is in love . Near to her close and consecrated bower , While she was in her dull and sleeping hour , A crew of patches , rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls , Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus nuptial day . The shallowest thick skin of that barren sort , Who Pyramus presented in their sport , Forsook his scene and entered in a brake , When I did him at this advantage take , An ass’s nole I fixèd on his head . Anon his Thisbe must be answerèd , And forth my mimic comes . When they him spy , As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , Or russet pated choughs , many in sort , Rising and cawing at the gun’s report , Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And , at our stamp , here o er and o er one falls .
Yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls , Not with the empty hollowness , but weight I take my leave before I have begun , For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done . Commend me to thy brother , Edmund York . Lo , this is all nay , yet depart not so Though this be all , do not so quickly go I shall remember more . Bid him ah , what With all good speed at Plashy visit me . Alack , and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnish’d walls , Unpeopled offices , untrodden stones And what hear there for welcome but my groans Therefore commend me let him not come there , To seek out sorrow that dwells every where . Desolate , desolate , will I hence and die The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye .
And that is Claudio . I know him by his bearing .
Are not you Signor Benedick
You know me well . I am he .
Signor , you are very near my brother in his love . He is enamored on Hero . I pray you , dissuade him from her . She is no equal for his birth . You may do the part of an honest man in it .
Go draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince .
How know you he loves her
A curtain is drawn showing a gold , silver , and lead casket
I heard him swear his affection .
Now make your choice .
So did I too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .
Come , let us to the banquet .
The first , of gold , who this inscription bears Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire . The second , silver , which this promise carries Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . This third , dull lead , with warning all as blunt Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . How shall I know if I do choose the right
The one of them contains my picture , Prince . If you choose that , then I am yours withal .
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick , But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio . Tis certain so , the Prince woos for himself . Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love . Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues . Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent , for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood . This is an accident of hourly proof , Which I mistrusted not . Farewell , therefore , Hero .
Some god direct my judgment Let me see . I will survey th inscriptions back again . What says this leaden casket Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . Must give for what For lead Hazard for lead This casket threatens . Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages . A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross . I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead . What says the silver with her virgin hue
But are my brother’s powers set forth
Ay , madam .
Himself in person there
Madam , with much ado . Your sister is the better soldier .
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home
No , madam .
What might import my sister’s letter to him
I know not , lady .
Faith , he is posted hence on serious matter . It was great ignorance , Gloucester’s eyes being out , To let him live . Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us . Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life moreover to descry The strength o th enemy .
I must needs after him , madam , with my letter .
Our troops set forth tomorrow . Stay with us . The ways are dangerous .
One that , above all other strifes , contended especially to know himself .
What pleasure was he given to
Rather rejoicing to see another merry , than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance . But leave we him to his events , with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared . I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation .
He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge , but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself , by the instruction of his frailty , many deceiving promises of life which I by my good leisure have discredited to him , and now is he resolved to die .
You have paid the heavens your function , and the prisoner the very debt of your calling . I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have I found so severe , that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice .
He Murder cries and help from Athens calls . Their sense thus weak , lost with their fears thus strong , Made senseless things begin to do them wrong . For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch , Some sleeves , some hats from yielders all things catch . I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there . When in that moment so it came to pass , Titania waked and straightway loved an ass .
This falls out better than I could devise . But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes With the love juice , as I did bid thee do
I pray you , hear her speak . If she confess that she was half the wooer , Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man . Come hither , gentle mistress . Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience
I took him sleeping that is finished too And the Athenian woman by his side , That , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .
My noble father , I do perceive here a divided duty . To you I am bound for life and education . My life and education both do learn me How to respect you . You are the lord of duty . I am hitherto your daughter . But here’s my husband . And so much duty as my mother showed To you , preferring you before her father , So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord .
Stand close . This is the same Athenian .
This is the woman , but not this the man .
God be with you . I have done . Please it your grace , on to the state affairs . I had rather to adopt a child than get it . Come hither , Moor . I here do give thee that with all my heart Which , but thou hast already , with all my heart I would keep from thee . For your sake , jewel , I am glad at soul I have no other child . For thy escape would teach me tyranny , To hang clogs on them . I have done , my lord .
Oh , why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which , as a grise or step , may help these lovers . When remedies are past , the griefs are ended By seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended .
Now I but chide , but I should use thee worse . For thou , I fear , hast given me cause to curse . If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep , Being o er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , And kill me too .
Lady , you know no rules of charity , Which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
Villain , thou know’st not law of God nor man . No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
But I know none , and therefore am no beast .
O , wonderful , when devils tell the truth
More wonderful , when angels are so angry . Vouchsafe , divine perfection of a woman , Of these supposèd crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself .
Vouchsafe , defused infection of a man , Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self .
Fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself .
Fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself .
By such despair I should accuse myself .
And by despairing shalt thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself That didst unworthy slaughter upon others .
Count Claudio
Yea , the same .
Come , will you go with me
Whither
Even to the next willow , about your own business , county . What fashion will you wear the garland of About your neck like an usurer’s chain Or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf You must wear it one way , for the Prince hath gat your Hero .
I wish him joy of her .
Why , that’s spoken like an honest drover so they sell bullocks . But did you think the Prince would have served you thus
I pray you , leave me .
Ho , now you strike like the blind man . Twas the boy that stole your meat , and you’ll beat the post .
If it will not be , I’ll leave you .
I may not , madam . My lady charged my duty in this business .
Why should she write to Edmund Might not you Transport her purposes by word Belike Some things I know not what . I’ll love thee much . Let me unseal the letter .
Madam , I had rather
I know your lady does not love her husband . I am sure of that . And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund . I know you are of her bosom .
I , madam
I speak in understanding . Y are . I know ’t . Therefore I do advise you , take this note . My lord is dead . Edmund and I have talked , And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s . You may gather more . If you do find him , pray you give him this . And when your mistress hears thus much from you , I pray desire her call her wisdom to her . So fare you well . If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor , Preferment falls on him that cuts him off .
Would I could meet him , madam , I should show What party I do follow .
Fare thee well .
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me . Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia I’ll believe as soon This whole Earth may be bored , and that the moon May through the center creep and so displease Her brother’s noontide with th Antipodes . It cannot be but thou hast murdered him . So should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
So should the murdered look , and so should I , Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty . Yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere .
What’s this to my Lysander Where is he Ah , good Demetrius , wilt thou give him me
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds .
Out , dog Out , cur Thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden’s patience . Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numbered among men Oh , once tell true , tell true even for my sake Durst thou have looked upon him being awake , And hast thou killed him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm , an adder , do so much An adder did it , for with doubler tongue Than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
You spend your passion on a misprised mood . I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood . Nor is he dead , for aught that I can tell .
I pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
An if I could , what should I get therefore
Say that I slew them not .
Then say they were not slain . But dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .
I did not kill your husband .
Why then , he is alive .
Nay , he is dead , and slain by Edward’s hands .
In thy foul throat thou liest . Queen Margaret saw Thy murd rous falchion smoking in his blood , The which thou once didst bend against her breast , But that thy brothers beat aside the point .
I was provokèd by her sland rous tongue , That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind , That never dream’st on aught but butcheries . Didst thou not kill this king
I grant you .
Dost grant me , hedgehog Then , God grant me too Thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed . O , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
The better for the King of heaven that hath him .
He is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .
Let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , For he was fitter for that place than earth .
Alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges . But that my Lady Beatrice should know me , and not know me The Prince’s fool Ha , it may be I go under that title because I am merry . Yea , but so I am apt to do myself wrong . I am not so reputed It is the base , though bitter , disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out . Well , I’ll be revenged as I may .
Now , Signior , where’s the Count Did you see him
Troth , my lord , I have played the part of Lady Fame . I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren . I told him , and I think I told him true , that your Grace had got the goodwill of this young lady , and I offered him my company to a willow tree , either to make him a garland , as being forsaken , or to bind him up a rod , as being worthy to be whipped .
To be whipped What’s his fault
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a birds nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is in the stealer .
When shall we come to th top of that same hill
You do climb up it now . Look how we labor .
Methinks the ground is even .
Horrible steep . Hark , do you hear the sea
No , truly .
Why then , your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes anguish .
So may it be indeed . Methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak’st In better phrase and matter than thou didst .
You’re much deceived . In nothing am I changed But in my garments .
Methinks you’re better spoken .
Come on , sir . Here’s the place . Stand still . How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles . Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade Methinks he seems no bigger than his head . The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice . And yon tall anchoring bark ,
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . As much as he deserves pause there , Morocco , And weigh thy value with an even hand . If thou beest rated by thy estimation , Thou dost deserve enough , and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady , And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself . As much as I deserve Why , that’s the lady . I do in birth deserve her , and in fortunes , In graces , and in qualities of breeding . But more than these , in love I do deserve . What if I strayed no further , but chose here Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold , Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire . Why , that’s the lady . All the world desires her . From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine , this mortal breathing saint . The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia . The watery kingdom , whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven , is no bar To stop the foreign spirits , but they come As o er a brook to see fair Portia . One of these three contains her heavenly picture . Is ’t like that lead contains her Twere damnation To think so base a thought . It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave . Or shall I think in silver she’s immured , Being ten times undervalued to tried gold O sinful thought Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold . They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold , but that’s insculped upon . But here an angel in a golden bed
If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding , it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail , he hath sentenced himself .
I am going to visit the prisoner . Fare you well .
Peace be with you
He who the sword of heaven will bear Should be as holy as severe Pattern in himself to know , Grace to stand , and virtue go More nor less to others paying Than by self offences weighing . Shame to him whose cruel striking Kills for faults of his own liking Twice treble shame on Angelo , To weed my vice and let his grow O , what may man within him hide , Though angel on the outward side How may likeness made in crimes , Making practise on the times , To draw with idle spiders’ strings Most ponderous and substantial things Craft against vice I must apply With Angelo to night shall lie His old betrothed but despised So disguise shall , by the disguised , Pay with falsehood false exacting , And perform an old contracting .
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made , and the garland too , for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you , who , as I take it , have stolen his birds nest .
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner .
If their singing answer your saying , by my faith , you say honestly .
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you . The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .
O , she misused me past the endurance of a block An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her . My very visor began to assume life and scold with her . She told me , not thinking I had been myself , that I was the Prince’s jester , that I was duller than a great thaw , huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me . She speaks poniards , and every word stabs . If her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her she would infect to the north star . I would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed . She would have made Hercules have turned spit , yea , and have cleft his club to make the fire , too . Come , talk not of her . You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel . I would to God some scholar would conjure her , for certainly , while she is here , a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary , and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither . So indeed all disquiet , horror and perturbation follows her .
And thou unfit for any place but hell .
Yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
Some dungeon .
Your bedchamber .
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
So will it , madam till I lie with you .
I hope so .
I know so . But , gentle Lady Anne , To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall something into a slower method Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets , Henry and Edward , As blameful as the executioner
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on . What cannot be preserved when fortune takes , Patience her injury a mock ry makes . The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief , He robs himself that spends a bootless grief .
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile , We lose it not , so long as we can smile . He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears . But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That , to pay grief , must of poor patience borrow . These sentences to sugar or to gall , Being strong on both sides , are equivocal . But words are words . I never yet did hear That the bruised heart was piercèd through the ears . I humbly beseech you , proceed to th affairs of state .
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus . Othello , the fortitude of the place is best known to you , and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , throws a more safer voice on you . You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boist rous expedition .
The tyrant custom , most grave senators , Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice driven bed of down . I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness , and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites . Most humbly therefore bending to your state ,
My Lord Aumerle , is Harry Hereford arm’d
Yea , at all points and longs to enter in .
The Duke of Norfolk , sprightfully and bold , Stays but the summons of the appellant’s trumpet .
Why , then , the champions are prepared , and stay For nothing but his majesty’s approach .
Marshal , demand of yonder champion The cause of his arrival here in arms Ask him his name and orderly proceed To swear him in the justice of his cause .
In God’s name and the king’s , say who thou art And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms , Against what man thou comest , and what thy quarrel Speak truly , on thy knighthood and thy oath As so defend thee heaven and thy valour
My name is Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk Who hither come engaged by my oath Which God defend a knight should violate Both to defend my loyalty and truth To God , my king and my succeeding issue , Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me And , by the grace of God and this mine arm , To prove him , in defending of myself , A traitor to my God , my king , and me And as I truly fight , defend me heaven
A privilege never to see me more . And from thy hated presence part I so . See me no more , whether he be dead or no .
There is no following her in this fierce vein . Here therefore for a while I will remain . So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe , Which now in some slight measure it will pay , If for his tender here I make some stay .
What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite , And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight . Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turned , and not a false turned true .
Then fate o errules that , one man holding troth , A million fail , confounding oath on oath .
About the wood go swifter than the wind , And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancy sick she is and pale of cheer , With sighs of love , that costs the fresh blood dear . By some illusion see thou bring her here . I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear .
I go , I go . Look how I go , Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow .
Look , here she comes .
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on . I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia , bring you the length of Prester John’s foot , fetch you a hair off the great Cham’s beard , do you any embassage to the Pygmies , rather than hold three words conference with this harpy . You have no employment for me
None but to desire your good company .
O God , sir , here’s a dish I love not . I cannot endure my Lady Tongue
Come , lady , come , you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick .
Indeed , my lord , he lent it me awhile , and I gave him use for it , a double heart for his single one . Marry , once before he won it of me with false dice . Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it .
You have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
Lies all within . Deliver me the key . Here do I choose , and thrive I as I may
There , take it , Prince . And if my form lie there Then I am yours .
O hell , what have we here A carrion death , within whose empty eye There is a written scroll . I’ll read the writing . All that glisters is not gold Often have you heard that told . Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold . Gilded tombs do worms enfold . Had you been as wise as bold , Young in limbs , in judgment old , Your answer had not been inscrolled . Fare you well . Your suit is cold Cold , indeed , and labor lost . Then , farewell , heat , and welcome , frost Portia , adieu . I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave . Thus losers part .
A gentle riddance . Draw the curtains , go . Let all of his complexion choose me so .
Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect .
Your beauty was the cause of that effect Your beauty , that did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world , So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom .
If I thought that , I tell thee , homicide , These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks .
Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid’s archery , Sink in apple of his eye . When his love he doth espy , Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky . When thou wakest , if she be by , Beg of her for remedy .
Captain of our fairy band , Helena is here at hand , And the youth , mistook by me , Pleading for a lover’s fee . Shall we their fond pageant see Lord , what fools these mortals be
Stand aside . The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake .
Then will two at once woo one . That must needs be sport alone . And those things do best please me That befall preposterously .
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears .
These eyes could never endure that beauty’s wrack . You should not blemish it , if I stood by . As all the world is cheerèd by the sun , So I by that . It is my day , my life .
Black night o ershade thy day , and death thy life .
Curse not thyself , fair creature thou art both .
I would I were , to be revenged on thee .
It is a quarrel most unnatural To be revenged on him that loveth thee .
It is a quarrel just and reasonable To be revenged on him that killed my husband .
He that bereft thee , lady , of thy husband Did it to help thee to a better husband .
His better doth not breathe upon the earth .
So I would not he should do me , my lord , lest I should prove the mother of fools . I have brought Count Claudio , whom you sent me to seek .
Why , how now , Count , wherefore are you sad
Not sad , my lord .
How then , sick
Neither , my lord .
The Count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .
I faith , lady , I think your blazon to be true , though , I’ll be sworn , if he be so , his conceit is false . Here , Claudio , I have wooed in thy name , and fair Hero is won . I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained . Name the day of marriage , and God give thee joy .
Count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes . His grace hath made the match , and all grace say Amen to it .
Speak , Count , ’tis your cue .
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy . I were but little happy if I could say how much . Lady , as you are mine , I am yours . I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
Diminished to her cock , her cock a buoy Almost too small for sight . The murmuring surge That on th unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Cannot be heard so high . I’ll look no more Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight Topple down headlong .
Set me where you stand .
Give me your hand . You are now within a foot Of th extreme verge . For all beneath the moon Would I not leap upright .
Let go my hand . Here , friend , ’s another purse , in it a jewel Well worth a poor man’s taking . Fairies and gods Prosper it with thee Go thou farther off . Bid me farewell , and let me hear thee going .
Now fare you well , good sir .
With all my heart .
Why I do trifle thus with his despair Is done to cure it .
O you mighty gods ,
Marshal , ask yonder knight in arms , Both who he is and why he cometh hither Thus plated in habiliments of war , And formally , according to our law , Depose him in the justice of his cause .
What is thy name and wherefore comest thou hither , Before King Richard in his royal lists Against whom comest thou and what’s thy quarrel Speak like a true knight , so defend thee heaven
Harry of Hereford , Lancaster and Derby Am I who ready here do stand in arms , To prove , by God’s grace and my body’s valour , In lists , on Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk , That he is a traitor , foul and dangerous , To God of heaven , King Richard and to me And as I truly fight , defend me heaven
On pain of death , no person be so bold Or daring hardy as to touch the lists , Except the marshal and such officers Appointed to direct these fair designs .
Lord marshal , let me kiss my sovereign’s hand , And bow my knee before his majesty For Mowbray and myself are like two men That vow a long and weary pilgrimage Then let us take a ceremonious leave And loving farewell of our several friends .
I crave fit disposition for my wife . Due reference of place and exhibition , With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding .
Why , at her father’s .
Look , when I vow , I weep . And vows so born , In their nativity all truth appears . How can these things in me seem scorn to you , Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
Take , O , take those lips away , That so sweetly were forsworn And those eyes , the break of day , Lights that do mislead the morn But my kisses bring again , bring again Seals of love , but sealed in vain , sealed in vain .
Break off thy song , and haste thee quick away Here comes a man of comfort , whose advice Hath often still’d my brawling discontent .
I cry you mercy , sir and well could wish You had not found me here so musical Let me excuse me , and believe me so , My mirth it much displeased , but pleased my woe .
’Tis good though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good , and good provoke to harm . I pray , you , tell me , hath any body inquired for me here to day much upon this time have I promised here to meet .
You have not been inquired after I have sat here all day .
I’ll not have it so .
Nor I .
You do advance your cunning more and more . When truth kills truth , O devilish holy fray These vows are Hermia’s . Will you give her o er Weigh oath with oath , and you will nothing weigh . Your vows to her and me , put in two scales , Will even weigh , and both as light as tales .
Nor would I there reside , To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye . Most gracious Duke , To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice , T assist my simpleness .
I had no judgment when to her I swore .
What would you , Desdemona
Nor none , in my mind , now you give her o er .
That I did love the Moor to live with him , My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world . My heart’s subdued Even to the very quality of my lord . I saw Othello’s visage in his mind , And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate . So that , dear lords , if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war , The rites for which I love him are bereft me , And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence . Let me go with him .
Demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
Let her have your voice . Vouch with me , heaven , I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite ,
Speak , cousin , or if you cannot , stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither .
In faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
Yea , my lord . I thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care . My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
O Helena , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine To what , my love , shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy . Oh , how ripe in show Thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow That pure congealèd white , high Taurus snow , Fanned with the eastern wind , turns to a crow When thou hold’st up thy hand . Oh , let me kiss This princess of pure white , this seal of bliss
O spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment . If you were civil and knew courtesy , You would not do me thus much injury . Can you not hate me , as I know you do , But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men , as men you are in show , You would not use a gentle lady so
He lives that loves thee better than he could .
Name him .
Plantagenet .
Why , that was he .
The selfsame name , but one of better nature .
Where is he
Here .
And so she doth , cousin .
Why dost thou spit at me
Good Lord for alliance Thus goes everyone to the world but I , and I am sunburnt . I may sit in a corner and cry , Heigh ho for a husband
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake .
Lady Beatrice , I will get you one .
Never came poison from so sweet a place .
Never hung poison on a fouler toad . Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes .
I would rather have one of your father’s getting . Hath your grace ne er a brother like you Your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .
Thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine .
Will you have me , lady
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead .
No , my lord , unless I might have another for working days . Your Grace is too costly to wear every day . But I beseech your Grace pardon me . I was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
Your silence most offends me , and to be merry best becomes you , for out o question you were born in a merry hour .
Why , man , I saw Bassanio under sail . With him is Gratiano gone along . And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not .
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke , Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship .
He came too late . The ship was under sail . But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica . Besides , Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship .
I never heard a passion so confused , So strange , outrageous , and so variable , As the dog Jew did utter in the streets . My daughter O my ducats O my daughter , Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats Justice , the law , my ducats , and my daughter A sealèd bag , two sealèd bags of ducats , Of double ducats , stol n from me by my daughter And jewels two stones , two rich and precious stones Stol n by my daughter Justice , find the girl She hath the stones upon her , and the ducats .
Why , all the boys in Venice follow him , Crying , His stones , his daughter , and his ducats
Gone , sir . Farewell . And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life when life itself Yields to the theft . Had he been where he thought , By this had thought been past . Alive or dead Ho you , sir , friend Hear you , sir Speak . Thus might he pass indeed . Yet he revives . What are you , sir
Away , and let me die .
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer , feathers , air , So many fathom down precipitating , Thou’dst shivered like an egg . But thou dost breathe , Hast heavy substance , bleed’st not , speak’st , art sound . Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell . Thy life’s a miracle . Speak yet again .
But have I fall n , or no
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn . Look up a height . The shrill gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard . Do but look up .
Alack , I have no eyes . Is wretchedness deprived that benefit , To end itself by death Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will .
Give me your arm . Up so . How is ’t Feel you your legs You stand .
Too well , too well .
I do constantly believe you . The time is come even now . I shall crave your forbearance a little may be I will call upon you anon , for some advantage to yourself .
I am always bound to you .
Very well met , and well come . What is the news from this good deputy
He hath a garden circummured with brick , Whose western side is with a vineyard back’d And to that vineyard is a planched gate , That makes his opening with this bigger key This other doth command a little door Which from the vineyard to the garden leads There have I made my promise Upon the heavy middle of the night To call upon him .
But shall you on your knowledge find this way
I have ta’en a due and wary note upon’t With whispering and most guilty diligence , In action all of precept , he did show me The way twice o’er .
Are there no other tokens Between you ’greed concerning her observance
I would they were , that I might die at once , For now they kill me with a living death . Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears , Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops . These eyes , which never shed remorseful tear No , when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When black faced Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father , like a child , Told the sad story of my father’s death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep , That all the standers by had wet their cheeks Like trees bedashed with rain in that sad time , My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath , and made them blind with weeping . I never sued to friend , nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word . But now thy beauty is proposed my fee , My proud heart sues , and prompts my tongue to speak .
Teach not thy lip such scorn , for it were made For kissing , lady , not for such contempt . If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive , Lo , here I lend thee this sharp pointed sword , Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee , I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee .
Nay , do not pause for I did kill King Henry But ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me . Nay , now dispatch ’twas I that stabbed young Edward But ’twas thy heavenly face that set me on .
The appellant in all duty greets your highness , And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave .
To vow , and swear , and superpraise my parts , When I am sure you hate me with your hearts . You both are rivals , and love Hermia , And now both rivals to mock Helena A trim exploit , a manly enterprise , To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes With your derision None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin , and extort A poor soul’s patience , all to make you sport .
You are unkind , Demetrius . Be not so . For you love Hermia . This you know I know . And here , with all good will , with all my heart , In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part . And yours of Helena to me bequeath , Whom I do love and will do till my death .
Never did mockers waste more idle breath .
Lysander , keep thy Hermia . I will none . If e er I loved her , all that love is gone . My heart to her but as guest wise sojourned , And now to Helen is it home returned , There to remain .
Helen , it is not so .
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know , Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear . Look , where thy love comes . Yonder is thy dear .
We will descend and fold him in our arms . Cousin of Hereford , as thy cause is right , So be thy fortune in this royal fight Farewell , my blood which if to day thou shed , Lament we may , but not revenge thee dead .
O let no noble eye profane a tear For me , if I be gored with Mowbray’s spear As confident as is the falcon’s flight Against a bird , do I with Mowbray fight . My loving lord , I take my leave of you Of you , my noble cousin , Lord Aumerle Not sick , although I have to do with death , But lusty , young , and cheerly drawing breath . Lo , as at English feasts , so I regreet The daintiest last , to make the end most sweet O thou , the earthly author of my blood , Whose youthful spirit , in me regenerate , Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up To reach at victory above my head , Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers And with thy blessings steel my lance’s point , That it may enter Mowbray’s waxen coat , And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt , Even in the lusty havior of his son .
Dark night , that from the eye his function takes , The ear more quick of apprehension makes . Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense , It pays the hearing double recompense .
This is above all strangeness . Upon the crown o th cliff , what thing was that Which parted from you
Let good Antonio look he keep his day , Or he shall pay for this .
A poor unfortunate beggar .
Marry , well remembered . I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday , Who told me , in the narrow seas that part The French and English , there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught . I thought upon Antonio when he told me , And wished in silence that it were not his .
As I stood here below , methought his eyes Were two full moons . He had a thousand noses , Horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea . It was some fiend . Therefore , thou happy father , Think that the clearest gods , who make them honors Of men’s impossibilities , have preserved thee .
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear Yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
I do remember now . Henceforth I’ll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself , Enough , enough , and die . That thing you speak of , I took it for a man . Often ’twould say , The fiend , the fiend He led me to that place .
Bear free and patient thoughts .
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth . I saw Bassanio and Antonio part . Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return . He answered , Do not so . Slubber not business for my sake , Bassanio But stay the very riping of the time . And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me , Let it not enter in your mind of love . Be merry , and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there . And even there , his eye being big with tears , Turning his face , he put his hand behind him , And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio’s hand . And so they parted .
But who comes here The safer sense will ne er accommodate His master thus .
No , they cannot touch me for coining . I am the king himself .
O thou side piercing sight
Nature’s above art in that respect . There’s your press money . That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper . Draw me a clothier’s yard . Look , look , a mouse Peace ,
No , none , but only a repair i’ the dark And that I have possess’d him my most stay Can be but brief for I have made him know I have a servant comes with me along , That stays upon me , whose persuasion is I come about my brother .
’Tis well borne up . I have not yet made known to Mariana A word of this . What , ho within come forth
I pray you , be acquainted with this maid She comes to do you good .
I do desire the like .
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you
Good friar , I know you do , and have found it .
Take , then , this your companion by the hand , Who hath a story ready for your ear . I shall attend your leisure but make haste The vaporous night approaches .
Will’t please you walk aside
O place and greatness millions of false eyes Are stuck upon thee volumes of report Run with these false and most contrarious quests Upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit Make thee the father of their idle dreams And rack thee in their fancies .
No , sure , my lord , my mother cried , but then there was a star danced , and under that was I born . Cousins , God give you joy
Niece , will you look to those things I told you of
I cry you mercy , uncle . By your Grace’s pardon .
By my troth , a pleasant spirited lady .
There’s little of the melancholy element in her , my lord . She is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband .
Oh , by no means . She mocks all her wooers out of suit .
She were an excellent wife for Benedict .
O Lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .
County Claudio , when mean you to go to church
Tomorrow , my lord . Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites .
Nor to comply with heat the young affects In my defunct and proper satisfaction , But to be free and bounteous to her mind , And heaven defend your good souls , that you think I will your serious and great business scant When she is with me . No , when light winged toys Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and officed instrument , That my disports corrupt and taint my business , Let housewives make a skillet of my helm And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation .
Be it as you shall privately determine , Either for her stay or going . Th affair cries haste And speed must answer it .
You must away tonight .
With all my heart .
At nine i th morning here we’ll meet again . Othello , leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you , And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you .
So please your grace , my ancient . A man he is of honesty and trust . To his conveyance I assign my wife , With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me .
peace , this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t . There’s my gauntlet . I’ll prove it on a giant . Bring up the brown bills . O , well flown , bird . I th clout , i th clout . Hewgh Give the word .
Sweet marjoram .
Pass .
I know that voice .
Ha Goneril with a white beard Ha , Regan They flattered me like a dog and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there . To say Ay and No to everything that I said Ay and No to was no good divinity . When the rain came to wet me once , and the wind to make me chatter , when the thunder would not peace at my bidding there I found em , there I smelt em out . Go to , they are not men o their words . They told me I was everything . Tis a lie , I am not ague proof .
The trick of that voice I do well remember . Is ’t not the king
Ay , every inch a king . When I do stare , see how the subject quakes . I pardon that man’s life . What was thy cause Adultery Thou shalt not die . Die for adultery No . The wren goes to ’t , and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight . Let copulation thrive , for Gloucester’s bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets . To ’t , luxury , pell mell for I lack soldiers .
Welcome , how agreed
She’ll take the enterprise upon her , father , If you advise it .
It is not my consent , But my entreaty too .
Little have you to say When you depart from him , but , soft and low , ‘Remember now my brother . ’
Fear me not .
Nor , gentle daughter , fear you not at all . He is your husband on a pre contract To bring you thus together , ’tis no sin , Sith that the justice of your title to him Doth flourish the deceit . Come , let us go Our corn’s to reap , for yet our tithe’s to sow .
I think he only loves the world for him . I pray thee , let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other .
Do we so .
Behold yond simpering dame , whose face between her forks presages snow , that minces virtue and does shake the head to hear of pleasure’s name . The fitchew , nor the soiled horse , goes to ’t with a more riotous appetite . Down from the waist they are centaurs , though women all above . But to the girdle do the gods inherit beneath is all the fiends . There’s hell , there’s darkness , there’s the sulfurous pit burning , scalding , stench , consumption Fie , fie , fie , pah , pah Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination . There’s money for thee .
O , let me kiss that hand
Let me wipe it first . It smells of mortality .
O ruined piece of nature This great world Shall so wear out to naught . Dost thou know me
I remember thine eyes well enough . Dost thou squiny at me No , do thy worst , blind Cupid . I’ll not love . Read thou this challenge . Mark but the penning of it .
Were all thy letters suns , I could not see one .
I would not take this from report . It is , And my heart breaks at it .
Read .
What , with the case of eyes
Oh ho , are you there with me No eyes in your head , nor no money in your purse Your eyes are in a heavy case , your purse in a light . Yet you see how this world goes .
Come hither , sirrah . Can you cut off a man’s head
If the man be a bachelor , sir , I can but if he be a married man , he’s his wife’s heada pun , referring both to the Biblical idea of the husband as the head of the wife wife’s head , and I can never cut off a woman’s head .
Come , sir , leave me your snatches , and yield me a direct answer . To morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine . Here is in our prison a common executioner , who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him , it shall redeem you from your gyves if not , you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping , for you have been a notorious bawd .
Sir , I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman . I would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow partner .
What , ho Abhorson Where’s Abhorson , there
Do you call , sir
Sirrah , here’s a fellow will help you to morrow in your execution . If you think it meet , compound with him by the year , and let him abide here with you if not , use him for the present and dismiss him . He cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd .
Take up the sword again , or take up me .
Arise , dissembler . Though I wish thy death , I will not be the executioner .
Then bid me kill myself , and I will do it .
I have already .
Quick , quick , I pray thee . Draw the curtain straight . The Prince of Arragon hath ta en his oath And comes to his election presently .
That was in thy rage . Speak it again and , even with the word , This hand , which for thy love did kill thy love , Shall for thy love kill a far truer love . To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
Behold , there stand the caskets , noble Prince . If you choose that wherein I am contained , Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized . But if you fail , without more speech , my lord , You must be gone from hence immediately .
I would I knew thy heart .
Tis figured in my tongue .
I am enjoined by oath to observe three things First , never to unfold to any one Which casket ’twas I chose next , if I fail Of the right casket , never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage lastly , If I do fail in fortune of my choice , Immediately to leave you and be gone .
I fear me both are false .
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self .
Then never man was man true .
And so have I addressed me . Fortune now To my heart’s hope Gold , silver , and base lead . Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath . You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard . What says the golden chest Ha , let me see . Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire .
Well , well , put up your sword .
Say then my peace is made .
That shall you know hereafter .
Thou art not by mine eye , Lysander , found . Mine ear , I thank it , brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
Why should he stay , whom love doth press to go
What love could press Lysander from my side
Lysander’s love , that would not let him bide , Fair Helena , who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light . Why seek’st thou me Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so
You speak not as you think . It cannot be .
Lo , she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport , in spite of me . Injurious Hermia Most ungrateful maid Have you conspired , have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shared , The sisters vows , the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us oh , is it all forgot All schooldays friendship , childhood innocence We , Hermia , like two artificial gods , Have with our needles created both one flower , Both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , Both warbling of one song , both in one key , As if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , Had been incorporate . So we grew together , Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet an union in partition Two lovely berries molded on one stem
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous Be swift like lightning in the execution And let thy blows , doubly redoubled , Fall like amazing thunder on the casque Of thy adverse pernicious enemy Rouse up thy youthful blood , be valiant and live .
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive
However God or fortune cast my lot , There lives or dies , true to King Richard’s throne , A loyal , just and upright gentleman Never did captive with a freer heart Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace His golden uncontroll’d enfranchisement , More than my dancing soul doth celebrate This feast of battle with mine adversary . Most mighty liege , and my companion peers , Take from my mouth the wish of happy years As gentle and as jocund as to jest Go I to fight truth hath a quiet breast .
Farewell , my lord securely I espy Virtue with valour couched in thine eye . Order the trial , marshal , and begin .
Harry of Hereford , Lancaster and Derby , Receive thy lance and God defend the right
Let it be so . Good night to every one . And , noble signior , If virtue no delighted beauty lack , Your son in law is far more fair than black .
Adieu , brave Moor . Use Desdemona well .
Look to her , Moor , if thou hast eyes to see . She has deceived her father , and may thee .
My life upon her faith Honest Iago , My Desdemona must I leave to thee . I prithee , let thy wife attend on her , And bring them after in the best advantage . Come , Desdemona , I have but an hour Of love , of worldly matter and direction , To spend with thee . We must obey the time .
Iago .
What say’st thou , noble heart
What will I do , think’st thou
Why , go to bed , and sleep .
I will incontinently drown myself .
I see it feelingly .
Not till Monday , my dear son , which is hence a just sevennight , and a time too brief , too , to have all things answer my mind .
What , art mad A man may see how this world goes with no eyes . Look with thine ears . See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief . Hark in thine ear change places and , handy dandy , which is the justice , which is the thief Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar
Come , you shake the head at so long a breathing , but I warrant thee , Claudio , the time shall not go dully by us . I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules labors , which is to bring Signor Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection , th one with th other . I would fain have it a match , and I doubt not but to fashion it , if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction .
Ay , sir .
My lord , I am for you , though it cost me ten nights watchings .
And I , my lord .
And the creature run from the cur There thou mightst behold the great image of authority a dog’s obeyed in office . Thou rascal beadle , hold thy bloody hand . Why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back . Thou hotly lust’st to use her in that kind For which thou whipp’st her . The usurer hangs the cozener . Through tattered clothes great vices do appear Robes and furred gowns hide all . Plate sin with gold , And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks . Arm it in rags , a pigmy’s straw does pierce it . None does offend none , I say , none . I’ll able em . Take that of me , my friend , who have the power To seal th accuser’s lips . Get thee glass eyes , And like a scurvy politician seem To see the things thou dost not . Now , now , now , now , Pull off my boots . Harder , harder . So .
And you too , gentle Hero
O matter and impertinency mixed Reason in madness
I will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know . Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain , of approved valor , and confirmed honesty . I will teach you how to humor your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick . And I , with your two helps , will so practice on Benedick that , in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach , he shall fall in love with Beatrice . If we can do this , Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours , for we are the only love gods . Go in with me , and I will tell you my drift .
What many men desire that many may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show , Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach Which pries not to th interior , but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall , Even in the force and road of casualty . I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes . Why then , to thee , thou silver treasure house . Tell me once more what title thou dost bear . Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . And well said too for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit Let none presume To wear an undeservèd dignity . Oh , that estates , degrees and offices Were not derived corruptly , and that clear honor Were purchased by the merit of the wearer How many then should cover that stand bare How many be commanded that command How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor And how much honor Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times To be new varnished Well , but to my choice . Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves . I will assume desert . Give me a key for this , And instantly unlock my fortunes here .
Too long a pause for that which you find there .
A bawd , sir fie upon him he will discredit our mystery .
Go to , sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale .
Pray , sir , by your good favour , for surely , sir , a good favour you have , but that you have a hanging look , do you call , sir , your occupation a mystery
Ay , sir a mystery
Painting , sir , I have heard say , is a mystery and your whores , sir , being members of my occupation , using painting , do prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in hanging , if I should be hanged , I cannot imagine .
Sir , it is a mystery .
Proof
Every true man’s apparel fits your thief if it be too little for your thief , your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief , your thief thinks it little enough so every true man’s apparel fits your thief .
Are you agreed
Sir , I will serve him for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgiveness .
If thou wilt weep my fortunes , take my eyes . I know thee well enough . Thy name is Gloucester . Thou must be patient . We came crying hither . Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry . I will preach to thee . Mark me .
Alack , alack the day
When we are born , we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools . This a good block . It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt . I’ll put ’t in proof . And when I have stol n upon these sons in law , Then , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill
Oh , here he is . Lay hand upon him . Sir , Your most dear daughter
No rescue What , a prisoner I am even The natural fool of fortune . Use me well . You shall have ransom . Let me have surgeons . I am cut to th brains .
You shall have anything .
No seconds All myself Why , this would make a man a man of salt , To use his eyes for garden water pots , Ay , and laying autumn’s dust .
Good sir
It is so . The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato .
Yea , my lord , but I can cross it .
Any bar , any cross , any impediment will be med cinable to me . I am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine . How canst thou cross this marriage
Not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
Show me briefly how .
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to Hero .
I remember .
I can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window .
Strong as a tower in hope , I cry amen .
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage
Go bear this lance to Thomas , Duke of Norfolk .
The poison of that lies in you to temper . Go you to the Prince your brother . Spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned Claudio , whose estimation do you mightily hold up , to a contaminated stale , such a one as Hero .
Harry of Hereford , Lancaster and Derby , Stands here for God , his sovereign and himself , On pain to be found false and recreant , To prove the Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Mowbray , A traitor to his God , his king and him And dares him to set forward to the fight .
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk , On pain to be found false and recreant , Both to defend himself and to approve Henry of Hereford , Lancaster , and Derby , To God , his sovereign and to him disloyal Courageously and with a free desire Attending but the signal to begin .
Sound , trumpets and set forward , combatants .
Stay , the king hath thrown his warder down .
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears , And both return back to their chairs again Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound While we return these dukes what we decree .
What’s here The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule I will read it . How much unlike art thou to Portia How much unlike my hopes and my deservings Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head Is that my prize Are my deserts no better
To offend and judge are distinct offices And of opposèd natures .
What is here The fire seven times tried this , Seven times tried that judgment is , That did never choose amiss . Some there be that shadows kiss . Such have but a shadow’s bliss . There be fools alive , iwis , Silvered o er and so was this . Take what wife you will to bed , I will ever be your head . So be gone . You are sped . Still more fool I shall appear By the time I linger here . With one fool’s head I came to woo , But I go away with two . Sweet , adieu . I’ll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth .
But shall I live in hope
All men I hope live so .
Vouchsafe to wear this ring .
To take is not to give .
Look , how this ring encompasseth finger Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart . Wear both of them , for both of them are thine . And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand , Thou dost confirm his happiness forever .
What is it
So , with two seeming bodies but one heart , Two of the first , like coats in heraldry , Due but to one and crownèd with one crest . And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly , ’tis not maidenly . Our sex , as well as I , may chide you for it , Though I alone do feel the injury .
That it would please you leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner , And presently repair to Crosby House , Where , after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monast ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears , I will with all expedient duty see you . For divers unknown reasons , I beseech you , Grant me this boon .
I am amazèd at your passionate words . I scorn you not . It seems that you scorn me .
With all my heart , and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent . Tressel and Berkeley , go along with me .
Bid me farewell .
Have you not set Lysander , as in scorn , To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love , Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess , nymph , divine , and rare , Precious , celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love , so rich within his soul , And tender me , forsooth , affection , But by your setting on , by your consent What though I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love , so fortunate But miserable most , to love unloved This you should pity rather than despise .
I understand not what you mean by this .
Ay , do . Persever , counterfeit sad looks , Make mouths upon me when I turn my back , Wink each at other , hold the sweet jest up This sport , well carried , shall be chronicled .
You , sirrah , provide your block and your axe to morrow four o’clock .
Come on , bawd I will instruct thee in my trade follow .
I do desire to learn , sir and I hope , if you have occasion to use me for your own turn , you shall find me yare for truly , sir , for your kindness I owe you a good turn .
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio The one has my pity not a jot the other , Being a murderer , though he were my brother .
Look , here’s the warrant , Claudio , for thy death ’Tis now dead midnight , and by eight to morrow Thou must be made immortal . Where’s Barnardine
As fast lock’d up in sleep as guiltless labour When it lies starkly in the traveller’s bones He will not wake .
Who can do good on him Well , go , prepare yourself .
But , hark , what noise Heaven give your spirits comfort
I will die bravely , like a smug bridegroom . What , I will be jovial . Come , come . I am a king , my masters , know you that
You are a royal one , and we obey you .
Then there’s life in ’t . Come , an if you get it , you shall get it by running . Sa , sa , sa , sa .
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , Past speaking of in a king . Thou hast a daughter Who redeems nature from the general curse Which twain have brought her to .
Hail , gentle sir .
Sir , speed you . What’s your will
Do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward
Most sure and vulgar . Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound .
But , by your favor , how near’s the other army
Near and on speedy foot . The main descry Stands in the hourly thought .
I thank you , sir . That’s all .
Thus hath the candle singed the moth . O these deliberate fools When they do choose , They have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
The ancient saying is no heresy . Hanging and wiving goes by destiny .
Come , draw the curtain , Nerissa .
Where is my lady
Here . What would my lord
Madam , there is alighted at your gate A young Venetian , one that comes before To signify th approaching of his lord , From whom he bringeth sensible regreets , To wit besides commends and courteous breath Gifts of rich value . Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love . A day in April never came so sweet To show how costly summer was at hand , As this forespurrer comes before his lord .
No more , I pray thee . I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee , Thou spend’st such high day wit in praising him . Come , come , Nerissa , for I long to see Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly .
Bassanio , Lord Love , if thy will it be
Tis more than you deserve But since you teach me how to flatter you , Imagine I have said farewell already .
Sirs , take up the corse .
Towards Chertsey , noble lord
No , to Whitefriars . There attend my coming .
Was ever woman in this humor wooed Was ever woman in this humor won I’ll have her , but I will not keep her long . What , I that killed her husband and his father , To take her in her heart’s extremest hate , With curses in her mouth , tears in her eyes , The bleeding witness of my hatred by , Having God , her conscience , and these bars against me , And I no friends to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks And yet to win her , all the world to nothing Ha Hath she forgot already that brave prince , Edward , her lord , whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury A sweeter and a Lovellier gentleman , Framed in the prodigality of nature , Young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , The spacious world cannot again afford .
By and by . I hope it is some pardon or reprieve For the most gentle Claudio .
Welcome father .
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night Envelope you , good Provost Who call’d here of late
None , since the curfew rung .
Not Isabel
No .
They will , then , ere’t be long .
What comfort is for Claudio
There’s some in hope .
It is a bitter deputy .
Not so , not so his life is parallel’d Even with the stroke and line of his great justice He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his power To qualify in others were he meal’d with that Which he corrects , then were he tyrannous But this being so , he’s just .
Though that the queen on special cause is here , Her army is moved on .
I thank you , sir .
If thou dost I shall never love thee after . Why , thou silly gentleman
You ever gentle gods , take my breath from me . Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please .
It is silliness to live when to live is torment , and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician .
Well pray you , father .
Oh , villainous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself . Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .
Now , good sir , what are you
A most poor man made tame to fortune’s blows , Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity . Give me your hand , I’ll lead you to some biding .
Hearty thanks . The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot .
A proclaimed prize Most happy That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes . Thou old unhappy traitor , Briefly thyself remember . The sword is out That must destroy thee .
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to ’t .
Draw near , And list what with our council we have done . For that our kingdom’s earth should not be soil’d With that dear blood which it hath fostered And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect Of civil wounds plough’d up with neighbours’ sword And for we think the eagle winged pride Of sky aspiring and ambitious thoughts , With rival hating envy , set on you To wake our peace , which in our country’s cradle Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums , With harsh resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray , And grating shock of wrathful iron arms , Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace And make us wade even in our kindred’s blood , Therefore , we banish you our territories You , cousin Hereford , upon pain of life , Till twice five summers have enrich’d our fields Shall not regreet our fair dominions , But tread the stranger paths of banishment .
Your will be done this must my comfort be , Sun that warms you here shall shine on me And those his golden beams to you here lent Shall point on me and gild my banishment .
What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .
Virtue A fig Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus . Our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners . So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills . If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost rous conclusions . But we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts . Whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion .
What proof shall I make of that
Proof enough to misuse the Prince , to vex Claudio , to undo Hero , and kill Leonato . Look you for any other issue
Only to despite them , I will endeavor anything .
Go then , find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone . Tell them that you know that Hero loves me . Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio , as in love of your brother’s honor , who hath made this match , and his friend’s reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus . They will scarcely believe this without trial . Offer them instances , which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window , hear me call Margaret Hero , hear Margaret term me Claudio , and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding , for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent , and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown .
Grow this to what adverse issue it can , I will put it in practice . Be cunning in the working this , and thy fee is a thousand ducats .
Be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
I will presently go learn their day of marriage .
Now , what news on the Rialto
Why , yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas . The Goodwins I think they call the place a very dangerous flat , and fatal , where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried , as they say , if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word .
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband . But it is true , without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk , that the good Antonio , the honest Antonio oh , that I had a title good enough to keep his name company
Come , the full stop .
Ha , what sayest thou Why , the end is he hath lost a ship .
I would it might prove the end of his losses .
Let me say Amen betimes , lest the devil cross my prayer , for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew .
If you have any pity , grace , or manners , You would not make me such an argument . But fare ye well . Tis partly my own fault , Which death or absence soon shall remedy .
Stay , gentle Helena . Hear my excuse . My love , my life , my soul , fair Helena
It cannot be .
Oh , excellent
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will . Come , be a man . Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend , and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness .
Sweet , do not scorn her so .
If she cannot entreat , I can compel .
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat . Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers . Helen , I love thee . By my life , I do . I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not .
I say I love thee more than he can do .
If thou say so , withdraw and prove it too .
Quick , come .
Lysander , whereto tends all this
Away , you Ethiope
No , no . He’ll Seem to break loose .
And will she yet abase her eyes on me , That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed On me , whose all not equals Edward’s moiety On me , that halts and am misshapen thus My dukedom to a beggarly denier , I do mistake my person all this while Upon my life , she finds , although I cannot , Myself to be a marv lous proper man . I’ll be at charges for a looking glass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body . Since I am crept in favor with myself , I will maintain it with some little cost . But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love . Shine out , fair sun , till I have bought a glass , That I may see my shadow as I pass .
Wherefore , bold peasant , Darest thou support a published traitor Hence , Lest that th infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee . Let go his arm .
Chill not let go , zir , without vurther casion .
Let go , slave , or thou diest
Good gentleman , go your gait , and let poor volk pass . An chud ha bin zwaggered out of my life , ’twould not ha bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight . Nay , come not near th old man . Keep out , che vor ye , or I’se try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder . Chill be plain with you .
Out , dunghill
Chill pick your teeth , zir . Come , no matter vor your foins .

I know thee well a serviceable villain , As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire .
What , is he dead
Now are they come .
This is a gentle provost seldom when The steeled gaoler is the friend of men .
How now what noise That spirit’s possessed with haste That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes .
There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in he is call’d up .
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet , But he must die to morrow
None , sir , none .
As near the dawning , provost , as it is , You shall hear more ere morning .
Happily You something know yet I believe there comes No countermand no such example have we Besides , upon the very siege of justice Lord Angelo hath to the public ear Profess’d the contrary .
This is his lordship’s man .
Norfolk , for thee remains a heavier doom , Which I with some unwillingness pronounce The sly slow hours shall not determinate The dateless limit of thy dear exile The hopeless word of ‘never to return’ Breathe I against thee , upon pain of life .
A heavy sentence , my most sovereign liege , And all unlook’d for from your highness’ mouth A dearer merit , not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air , Have I deserved at your highness’ hands . The language I have learn’d these forty years , My native English , now I must forego And now my tongue’s use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp , Or like a cunning instrument cased up , Or , being open , put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony Within my mouth you have engaol’d my tongue , Doubly portcullis’d with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me . I am too old to fawn upon a nurse , Too far in years to be a pupil now What is thy sentence then but speechless death , Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
How now , Shylock What news among the merchants
You knew none so well , none so well as you of my daughter’s flight .
Have patience , madam . There’s no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health .
That’s certain . I , for my part , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal .
In that you brook it ill , it makes him worse . Therefore , for God’s sake , entertain good comfort And cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes .
And Shylock , for his own part , knew the bird was fledged , and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam .
If he were dead , what would betide on me
She is damned for it .
No other harm but loss of such a lord .
That’s certain if the devil may be her judge .
My own flesh and blood to rebel
The loss of such a lord includes all harms .
The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son To be your comforter when he is gone .
Out upon it , old carrion Rebels it at these years
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood .
Ah , he is young , and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester , A man that loves not me nor none of you .
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory , more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish . But tell us , do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no
Sit you down , father . Rest you . Let’s see these pockets . The letters that he speaks of May be my friends . He’s dead . I am only sorry He had no other death’s man . Let us see . Let our reciprocal vows be remembered . You have many opportunities to cut him off . If your will want not , time and place will be fruitfully offered . There is nothing done if he return the conqueror . Then am I the prisoner and his bed my gaol , from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me , and supply the place for your labor . Your wife , so I would say affectionate servant , and for you her own for venture , Goneril . O indistinguished space of woman’s will A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life , And the exchange my brother Here in the sands Thee I’ll rake up , the post unsanctified Of murderous lechers . And in the mature time With this ungracious paper strike the sight Of the death practiced duke . For him ’tis well That of thy death and business I can tell .
The king is mad . How stiff is my vile sense , That I stand up and have ingenious feeling Of my huge sorrows . Better I were distract So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs , And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves .
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector
It is determined , not concluded yet But so it must be if the king miscarry .
Take on as you would follow , But yet come not . You are a tame man , go
Hang off , thou cat , thou burr Vile thing , let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent .
Why are you grown so rude What change is this , Sweet love
Thy love Out , tawny Tartar , out Out , loathèd medicine O hated potion , hence
Do you not jest
Yes , sooth , and so do you .
Demetrius , I will keep my word with thee .
I would I had your bond , for I perceive A weak bond holds you . I’ll not trust your word .
What , should I hurt her , strike her , kill her dead Although I hate her , I’ll not harm her so .
Boy
What , can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me Wherefore O me What news , my love Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile . Since night you loved me . Yet since night you left me . Why then , you left me Oh , the gods forbid In earnest , shall I say
Signior
Ay , by my life , And never did desire to see thee more . Therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt .
In my chamber window lies a book . Bring it hither to me in the orchard .
I am here already , sir .
I know that , but I would have thee hence and here again .
I do much wonder that one man , seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love , will , after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others , become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio . I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe . I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor , and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet . He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose , like an honest man and a soldier , and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet , just so many strange dishes . May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not .
I could never better stead thee than now . Put money in thy purse . Follow thou the wars , defeat thy favor with an usurped beard . I say , put money in thy purse . It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her . It was a violent commencement in her , and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse . These Moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money . The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida . She must change for youth . When she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice . Therefore , put money in thy purse . If thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning . Make all the money thou canst . If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her . Therefore make money . A pox of drowning thyself Tis clean out of the way . Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her .
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes , if I depend on the issue
Thou art sure of me . Go , make money . I have told thee often , and I re tell thee again and again , I hate the Moor . My cause is hearted . Thine hath no less reason . Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him . If thou canst cuckold him , thou dost thyself a pleasure , me a sport . There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered . Traverse , go , provide thy money . We will have more of this tomorrow . Adieu .
Where shall we meet i th morning
Here comes the lord of Buckingham , and Derby .
Good time of day unto your royal Grace .
God make your Majesty joyful , as you have been .
The countess Richmond , good my lord of Derby , To your good prayer will scarcely say amen . Yet , Derby , notwithstanding she’s your wife And loves not me , be you , good lord , assured I hate not you for her proud arrogance .
I do beseech you either not believe The envious slanders of her false accusers , Or if she be accused in true report , Bear with her weakness , which I think proceeds From wayward sickness and no grounded malice .
Saw you the king today , my lord of Derby
But now the duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty .
What likelihood of his amendment , lords
Madam , good hope . His grace speaks cheerfully .
Be certain , nothing truer . Tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena .
O me You juggler You canker blossom You thief of love What , have you come by night And stol n my love’s heart from him
Fine , i faith Have you no modesty , no maiden shame , No touch of bashfulness What , will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie , fie You counterfeit , you puppet , you
Puppet Why so Ay , that way goes the game . Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures . She hath urged her height , And with her personage , her tall personage , Her height , forsooth , she hath prevailed with him . And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I , thou painted maypole Speak . How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes .
I pray you , though you mock me , gentlemen , Let her not hurt me . I was never cursed . I have no gift at all in shrewishness . I am a right maid for my cowardice . Let her not strike me . You perhaps may think , Because she is something lower than myself , That I can match her .
I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster , but I’ll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool . One woman is fair , yet I am well another is wise , yet I am well another virtuous , yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman , one woman shall not come in my grace . Rich she shall be , that’s certain wise , or I’ll none virtuous , or I’ll never cheapen her fair , or I’ll ever look on her mild , or come not near me noble , or not I for an angel of good discourse , an excellent musician , and her hair shall be of what color it please God . Ha The Prince and Monsieur Love I will hide me in the arbor .
Come , shall we hear this music
Yea , my good lord . How still the evening is , As hushed on purpose to grace harmony
And here comes Claudio’s pardon .
See you where Benedick hath hid himself
My lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge , that you swerve not from the smallest article of it , neither in time , matter , or other circumstance . Good morrow for , as I take it , it is almost day .
O , very well , my lord . The music ended , We’ll fit the kid fox with a pennyworth .
I shall obey him .
Come , Balthasar , we’ll hear that song again .
This is his pardon , purchased by such sin For which the pardoner himself is in . Hence hath offence his quick celerity , When it is born in high authority When vice makes mercy , mercy’s so extended , That for the fault’s love is the offender friended . Now , sir , what news
I told you . Lord Angelo , belike thinking me remiss in mine office , awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely , for he hath not used it before .
Pray you , let’s hear .
‘Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary , let Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine for my better satisfaction , let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five . Let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver . Thus fail not to do your office , as you will answer it at your peril . ’ What say you to this , sir
It boots thee not to be compassionate After our sentence plaining comes too late .
Then thus I turn me from my country’s light , To dwell in solemn shades of endless night .
Return again , and take an oath with thee . Lay on our royal sword your banish’d hands Swear by the duty that you owe to God Our part therein we banish with yourselves To keep the oath that we administer You never shall , so help you truth and God Embrace each other’s love in banishment Nor never look upon each other’s face Nor never write , regreet , nor reconcile This louring tempest of your home bred hate Nor never by advised purpose meet To plot , contrive , or complot any ill ’Gainst us , our state , our subjects , or our land .
I swear .
And I , to keep all this .
Norfolk , so far as to mine enemy By this time , had the king permitted us , One of our souls had wander’d in the air . Banish’d this frail sepulchre of our flesh , As now our flesh is banish’d from this land Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm Since thou hast far to go , bear not along The clogging burthen of a guilty soul .
At my lodging .
There I have another bad match a bankrupt , a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto , a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart . Let him look to his bond . He was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond . He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him look to his bond .
Why , I am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh . What’s that good for
To bait fish withal . If it will feed nothing else , it will feed my revenge . He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million , laughed at my losses , mocked at my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies and what’s his reason I am a Jew . Hath not a Jew eyes Hath not a Jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions Fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is If you prick us , do we not bleed If you tickle us , do we not laugh If you poison us , do we not die And if you wrong us , shall we not revenge If we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that . If a Jew wrong a Christian , what is his humility Revenge . If a Christian wrong a Jew , what should his sufferance be by Christian example Why , revenge . The villainy you teach me I will execute and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction .
I’ll be with thee betimes .
Go to , farewell . Do you hear , Roderigo
What say you
No more of drowning , do you hear
I am changed .
Go to , farewell . Put money enough in your purse .
I’ll sell all my land .
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse . For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit . I hate the Moor , And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets He’s done my office . I know not if ’t be true , But I , for mere suspicion in that kind , Will do as if for surety . He holds me well . The better shall my purpose work on him . Cassio’s a proper man . Let me see now ,
God grant him health . Did you confer with him
Ay , madam . He desires to make atonement Betwixt the duke of Gloucester and your brothers , And betwixt them and my Lord Chamberlain , And sent to warn them to his royal presence .
Would all were well but that will never be . I fear our happiness is at the height .
They do me wrong , and I will not endure it Who is it that complains unto the king That I , forsooth , am stern and love them not By holy Paul , they love his grace but lightly That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors . Because I cannot flatter and look fair , Smile in men’s faces , smooth , deceive and cog , Duck with French nods and apish courtesy , I must be held a rancorous enemy . Cannot a plain man live and think no harm , But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken , sly , insinuating jacks
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace
To thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace . When have I injured thee When done thee wrong Or thee Or thee Or any of your faction A plague upon you all His royal grace , Whom God preserve better than you would wish , Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints .
Give me your hand . Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum . Come , father , I’ll bestow you with a friend .
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon
A Bohemian born , but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old .
How came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner to do so .
His friends still wrought reprieves for him and , indeed , his fact , till now in the government of Lord Angelo , came not to an undoubtful proof .
It is now apparent
Most manifest , and not denied by himself .
Hath he born himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless , reckless , and fearless of what’s past , present , or to come insensible of mortality , and desperately mortal .
He wants advice .
He will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence , he would not drunk many times a day , if not many days entirely drunk . We have very oft awaked him , as if to carry him to execution , and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all .
O , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once .
Lower Hark , again
It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection . I pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
Because you talk of wooing , I will sing , Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy , yet he woos , Yet will he swear he loves .
Good Hermia , do not be so bitter with me . I evermore did love you , Hermia , Did ever keep your counsels , never wronged you Save that , in love unto Demetrius , I told him of your stealth unto this wood . He followed you . For love I followed him . But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me , spurn me nay , to kill me too . And now , so you will let me quiet go , To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further . Let me go . You see how simple and how fond I am .
Why , get you gone Who is ’t that hinders you
Nay , pray thee , come , Or , if thou wilt hold longer argument , Do it in notes .
A foolish heart , that I leave here behind .
Note this before my notes There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting .
What , with Lysander
Why , these are very crotchets that he speaks Note notes , forsooth , and nothing .
With Demetrius .
Be not afraid . She shall not harm thee , Helena .
Now , divine air Now is his soul ravished . Is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies Well , a horn for my money , when all’s done .
No , sir , she shall not , though you take her part .
Oh , when she’s angry , she is keen and shrewd She was a vixen when she went to school . And though she be but little , she is fierce .
Little again Nothing but low and little Why will you suffer her to flout me thus Let me come to her .
Brother of Gloucester , you mistake the matter . The king , on his own royal disposition , And not provoked by any suitor else , Aiming belike at your interior hatred That in your outward actions shows itself Against my children , brothers , and myself , Makes him to send , that he may learn the ground .
I cannot tell . The world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch . Since every jack became a gentleman , There’s many a gentle person made a jack .
Come , come , we know your meaning , brother Gloucester . You envy my advancement , and my friends . God grant we never may have need of you .
Meantime God grants that we have need of you . Our brother is imprisoned by your means , Myself disgraced , and the nobility Held in contempt , while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble .
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed , I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence , but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him . My lord , you do me shameful injury Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects .
No , Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor , My name be blotted from the book of life , And I from heaven banish’d as from hence But what thou art , God , thou , and I do know And all too soon , I fear , the king shall rue . Farewell , my liege . Now no way can I stray Save back to England , all the world’s my way .
Uncle , even in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect Hath from the number of his banish’d years Pluck’d four away .
Six frozen winter spent , Return with welcome home from banishment .
How long a time lies in one little word Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word such is the breath of kings .
More of him anon . There is written in your brow , provost , honesty and constancy if I read it not truly , my ancient skill beguiles me but , in the boldness of my cunning , I will lay myself in hazard . Claudio , whom here you have warrant to execute , is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him . To make you understand this in a manifested effect , I crave but four days’ respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy .
Pray , sir , in what
In the delaying death .
I thank my liege , that in regard of me He shortens four years of my son’s exile But little vantage shall I reap thereby For , ere the six years that he hath to spend Can change their moons and bring their times about My oil dried lamp and time bewasted light Shall be extinct with age and endless night My inch of taper will be burnt and done , And blindfold death not let me see my son .
A lack , how may I do it , having the hour limited , and an express command , under penalty , to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case as Claudio’s , to cross this in the smallest .
By the vow of mine order I warrant you , if my instructions may be your guide . Let this Barnardine be this morning executed , and his head born to Angelo .
Angelo hath seen them both , and will discover the favour .
O , death’s a great disguiser and you may add to it . Shave the head , and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common . If any thing fall to you upon this , more than thanks and good fortune , by the saint whom I profess , I will plead against it with my life .
Get you gone , you dwarf , You minimus of hindering knotgrass made , You bead , you acorn
You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services . Let her alone . Speak not of Helena . Take not her part . For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her , Thou shalt aby it .
Now she holds me not . Now follow , if thou darest , to try whose right , Of thine or mine , is most in Helena .
Follow Nay , I’ll go with thee , cheek by jowl .
You , mistress , all this coil is long of you . Nay , go not back .
I will not trust you , I , Nor longer stay in your curst company . Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray . My legs are longer though , to run away .
I am amazed and know not what to say .
This is thy negligence . Still thou mistakest , Or else committ’st thy knaveries willfully .
Sigh no more , ladies , sigh no more , Men were deceivers ever , One foot in sea and one on shore , To one thing constant never . Then sigh not so , but let them go , And be you blithe and bonny , Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey , nonny nonny . Sing no more ditties , sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy . The fraud of men was ever so , Since summer first was leavy . Then sigh not so , but let them go And be you blithe and bonny , Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey , nonny nonny .
By my troth , a good song .
And an ill singer , my lord .
Ha , no , no , faith , thou sing’st well enough for a shift .
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus , they would have hanged him . And I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief . I had as lief have heard the night raven , come what plague could have come after it .
Yea , marry , dost thou hear , Balthasar I pray thee , get us some excellent music , for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window
To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery . How How Let’s see . After some time , to abuse Othello’s ear That he is too familiar with his wife . He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected , framed to make women false . The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so , And will as tenderly be led by th nose As asses are . I have ’t . It is engendered Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light .
O thou good Kent , how shall I live and work To match thy goodness My life will be too short , And every measure fail me .
Gentlemen , my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both .
To be acknowledged , madam , is o erpaid . All my reports go with the modest truth , Nor more , nor clipped , but so .
We have been up and down to seek him .
Be better suited . These weeds are memories of those worser hours . I prithee , put them off .
Pardon , dear madam . Yet to be known shortens my made intent . My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet .
Here comes another of the tribe . A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew .
Then be ’t so , my good lord . How does the king
Madam , sleeps still .
How now , Tubal What news from Genoa Hast thou found my daughter
O you kind gods , Cure this great breach in his abusèd nature , Th untuned and jarring senses , O , wind up , Of this child changèd father
I often came where I did hear of her , but cannot find her .
So please your majesty That we may wake the king He hath slept long .
Why , there , there , there , there A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt the curse never fell upon our nation till now I never felt it till now Two thousand ducats in that , and other precious , precious jewels . I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin No news of them Why , so . And I know not what’s spent in the search . Why thou , loss upon loss The thief gone with so much , and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction , no revenge . Nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o my shoulders , no sighs but o my breathing , no tears but o my shedding .
Why uncle , thou hast many years to live .
But not a minute , king , that thou canst give Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow , And pluck nights from me , but not lend a morrow Thou canst help time to furrow me with age , But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage Thy word is current with him for my death , But dead , thy kingdom cannot buy my breath .
Thy son is banish’d upon good advice , Whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave Why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour . You urged me as a judge but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father . O , had it been a stranger , not my child , To smooth his fault I should have been more mild A partial slander sought I to avoid , And in the sentence my own life destroy’d . Alas , I look’d when some of you should say , I was too strict to make mine own away But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue Against my will to do myself this wrong .
Cousin , farewell and , uncle , bid him so Six years we banish him , and he shall go .
Believe me , King of Shadows , I mistook . Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on And so far blameless proves my enterprise , That I have nointed an Athenian’s eyes . And so far am I glad it so did sort , As this their jangling I esteem a sport .
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight . Hie therefore , Robin , overcast the night . The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron , And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way . Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue , Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong . And sometime rail thou like Demetrius . And from each other look thou lead them thus , Till o er their brows death counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep . Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye , Whose liquor hath this virtuous property To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight . When they next wake , all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision . And back to Athens shall the lovers wend , With league whose date till death shall never end . Whiles I in this affair do thee employ , I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy . And then I will her charmèd eye release From monster’s view , and all things shall be peace .
You may deny that you were not the mean Of my Lord Hastings late imprisonment .
She may , my lord , for
She may , Lord Rivers . Why , who knows not so She may do more , sir , than denying that . She may help you to many fair preferments And then deny her aiding hand therein , And lay those honors on your high desert . What may she not She may , ay , marry , may she
What , marry , may she
What , marry , may she Marry with a king , A bachelor , a handsome stripling too . I wis , your grandam had a worser match .
My Lord of Gloucester , I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs . By heaven , I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured . I had rather be a country servant maid Than a great queen with this condition , To be so baited , scorned , and stormèd at .
Small joy have I in being England’s queen .
And lessened be that small , God I beseech Him Thy honor , state , and seat is due to me .
The best I can , my lord .
Do so . Farewell .
Come hither , Leonato . What was it you told me of today , that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick
Oh , ay . Stalk on , stalk on the fowl sits . I did never think that lady would have loved any man .
No , nor I neither , but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signor Benedick , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor .
Is ’t possible Sits the wind in that corner
By my troth , my lord , I cannot tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .
May be she doth but counterfeit .
Faith , like enough .
O God Counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it .
Pardon me , good father it is against my oath .
Why , what effects of passion shows she
Were you sworn to the duke , or to the deputy
Bait the hook well this fish will bite .
To him , and to his substitutes .
You will think you have made no offence , if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing
But what likelihood is in that
Not a resemblance , but a certainty . Yet since I see you fearful , that neither my coat , integrity , nor persuasion can with ease attempt you , I will go further than I meant , to pluck all fears out of you . Look you , sir , here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character , I doubt not and the signet is not strange to you .
I know them both .
The contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over read it at your pleasure where you shall find , within these two days he will be here . This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the duke’s death perchance entering into some monastery but , by chance , nothing of what is writ . Look , the unfolding star calls up the shepherd . Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known . Call your executioner , and off with Barnardine’s head I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place . Yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you . Come away it is almost clear dawn .
Cousin , farewell what presence must not know , From where you do remain let paper show .
My lord , no leave take I for I will ride , As far as land will let me , by your side .
O , to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words , That thou return’st no greeting to thy friends
I have too few to take my leave of you , When the tongue’s office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart .
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time .
What from the cape can you discern at sea
Joy absent , grief is present for that time .
My fairy lord , this must be done with haste . For night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast , And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger , At whose approach , ghosts , wandering here and there , Troop home to churchyards . Damnèd spirits all , That in crossways and floods have burial , Already to their wormy beds are gone . For fear lest day should look their shames upon , They willfully themselves exile from light And must for aye consort with black browed night .
What is six winters they are quickly gone .
Nothing at all . It is a high wrought flood . I cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail .
But we are spirits of another sort . I with the morning’s love have oft made sport , And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate , all fiery red , Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams , Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams . But notwithstanding , haste . Make no delay . We may effect this business yet ere day .
To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten .
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , A fuller blast ne er shook our battlements . If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea What ribs of oak , when mountains melt on them , Can hold the mortise What shall we hear of this
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure .
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down . I am feared in field and town . Goblin , lead them up and down . Here comes one .
A segregation of the Turkish fleet . For do but stand upon the foaming shore , The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , The wind shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , Seems to cast water on the burning bear , And quench the guards of th ever fixèd pole . I never did like molestation view On the enchafèd flood .
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so , Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage .
If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed , they are drowned . It is impossible they bear it out .
Where art thou , proud Demetrius Speak thou now .
The sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home return .
Nay , rather , every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love . Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages , and in the end , Having my freedom , boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to grief
Yes , other men have ill luck too . Antonio , as I heard in Genoa
What , what , what Ill luck , ill luck
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis .
I thank God , I thank God Is ’t true , is ’t true
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack .
I thank thee , good Tubal . Good news , good news Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
Your daughter spent in Genoa , as I heard , in one night fourscore ducats .
Thou stickest a dagger in me . I shall never see my gold again . Fourscore ducats at a sitting Fourscore ducats
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break .
I am very glad of it . I’ll plague him . I’ll torture him . I am glad of it .
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey .
Out upon her Thou torturest me , Tubal . It was my turquoise . I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor . I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys .
Be governed by your knowledge , and proceed I th sway of your own will . Is he arrayed
Ay , madam . In the heaviness of his sleep We put fresh garments on him .
Be by , good madam , when we do awake him . I doubt not of his temperance .
Very well .
Please you , draw near . Louder the music there
O my dear father , restoration hang Thy medicine on my lips , and let this kiss Repair those violent harms that my two sisters Have in thy reverence made
Kind and dear princess
Had you not been their father , these white flakes Did challenge pity of them . Was this a face To be opposed against the warring winds To stand against the deep dread bolted thunder In the most terrible and nimble stroke Of quick cross lightning To watch poor perdu With this thin helm Mine enemy’s meanest dog , Though he had bit me , should have stood that night Against my fire . And wast thou fain , poor father , To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn In short and musty straw Alack , alack Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all . He wakes . Speak to him .
What , threat you me with telling of the king Tell him , and spare not . Look , what I have said , I will avouch ’t in presence of the king I dare adventure to be sent to th Tower . Tis time to speak . My pains are quite forgot .
Out , devil I do remember them too well Thou killed’st my husband Henry in the Tower , And Edward , my poor son , at Tewkesbury .
Ere you were queen , ay , or your husband king , I was a packhorse in his great affairs , A weeder out of his proud adversaries , A liberal rewarder of his friends . To royalize his blood , I spent mine own .
Ay , and much better blood than his or thine .
In all which time , you and your husband Grey Were factious for the house of Lancaster . And , Rivers , so were you . Was not your husband In Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain Let me put in your minds , if you forget , What you have been ere this , and what you are Withal , what I have been , and what I am .
A murd rous villain , and so still thou art .
But Antonio is certainly undone .
Nay , that’s true , that’s very true . Go , Tubal , fee me an officer . Bespeak him a fortnight before . I will have the heart of him if he forfeit , for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will . Go , go , Tubal , and meet me at our synagogue . Go , good Tubal . At our synagogue , Tubal .
Madam , do you . Tis fittest .
What effects , my lord She will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how .
How does my royal lord How fares your majesty
She did indeed .
You do me wrong to take me out o th grave . Thou art a soul in bliss , but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire , that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead .
Sir , do you know me
How , how I pray you You amaze me . I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
I would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against Benedick .
You are a spirit , I know . Where did you die
I should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it . Knavery cannot , sure , hide himself in such reverence .
Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick , Ay , and forswore himself which Jesu pardon
Which God revenge
Still , still far wide
To fight on Edward’s party for the crown And for his meed , poor lord , he is mewed up . I would to God my heart were flint , like Edward’s , Or Edward’s soft and pitiful , like mine . I am too childish foolish for this world .
He’s scarce awake . Let him alone awhile .
Hie thee to hell for shame , and leave the world , Thou cacodemon There thy kingdom is .
He hath ta en th infection . Hold it up .
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick
News , lads , Our wars are done The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks , That their designment halts . A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet .
How Is this true
The ship is here put in , A Veronesa . Michael Cassio , Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello , Is come on shore . The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus .
I am glad on ’t . Tis a worthy governor .
Here , villain . Drawn and ready . Where art thou
I will be with thee straight .
Follow me then To plainer ground .
Lysander , speak again Thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
Thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars , And wilt not come Come , recreant . Come , thou child I’ll whip thee with a rod . He is defiled That draws a sword on thee .
Yea , art thou there
Follow my voice . We’ll try no manhood here .
He goes before me and still dares me on . When I come where he calls , then he is gone . The villain is much lighter heeled than I . I followed fast , but faster he did fly , That fallen am I in dark uneven way ,
Where have I been Where am I Fair daylight I am mightily abused . I should ev n die with pity To see another thus . I know not what to say . I will not swear these are my hands . Let’s see . I feel this pinprick . Would I were assured Of my condition .
O , look upon me , sir , And hold your hands in benediction o er me . No , sir , you must not kneel .
No , and swears she never will . That’s her torment .
My Lord of Gloucester , in those busy days Which here you urge to prove us enemies , We followed then our lord , our sovereign king . So should we you , if you should be our king .
If I should be I had rather be a peddler . Far be it from my heart , the thought thereof .
As little joy , my lord , as you suppose You should enjoy were you this country’s king , As little joy may you suppose in me That I enjoy , being the queen thereof .
All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens . Teach thy necessity to reason thus There is no virtue like necessity . Think not the king did banish thee , But thou the king . Woe doth the heavier sit , Where it perceives it is but faintly borne . Go , say I sent thee forth to purchase honour And not the king exiled thee or suppose Devouring pestilence hangs in our air And thou art flying to a fresher clime Look what thy soul holds dear , imagine it To lie that way thou go’st , not whence thou comest Suppose the singing birds musicians , The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strew’d , The flowers fair ladies , and thy steps no more Than a delightful measure or a dance For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it light .
O , who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summer’s heat O , no the apprehension of the good Gives but the greater feeling to the worse Fell sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle more Than when he bites , but lanceth not the sore .
But this same Cassio , though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss , yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe . For they were parted With foul and violent tempest .
Pray heavens he be , For I have served him , and the man commands Like a full soldier . Let’s to the seaside , ho As well to see the vessel that’s come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello , Even till we make the main and th aerial blue An indistinct regard .
Come , let’s do so . For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance .
Tis true indeed , so your daughter says . Shall I , says she , that have so oft encountered him with scorn , write to him that I love him
Pray , do not mock me . I am a very foolish fond old man , Fourscore and upward , not an hour more nor less . And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind . Methinks I should know you , and know this man .
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him , for she’ll be up twenty times a night , and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper . My daughter tells us all .
Now you talk of a sheet of paper , I remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
I pray you , tarry . Pause a day or two Before you hazard , for in choosing wrong I lose your company . Therefore forbear awhile . There’s something tells me but it is not love I would not lose you , and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality . But lest you should not understand me well And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me . I could teach you How to choose right , but I am then forsworn . So will I never be . So may you miss me . But if you do , you’ll make me wish a sin , That I had been forsworn . Beshrew your eyes , They have o erlooked me and divided me . One half of me is yours , the other half yours Mine own , I would say . But if mine , then yours , And so all yours . Oh , these naughty times Put bars between the owners and their rights And so , though yours , not yours . Prove it so . Let Fortune go to hell for it , not I . I speak too long , but ’tis to peize the time , To eke it and to draw it out in length , To stay you from election .
Let me choose , For as I am , I live upon the rack .
Upon the rack , Bassanio Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love .
And here will rest me .
Ho , ho , ho Coward , why comest thou not
Abide me , if thou darest For well I wot Thou runn’st before me , shifting every place , And darest not stand nor look me in the face . Where art thou now
Come hither . I am here .
Nay , then , thou mock’st me . Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see . Now go thy way . Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed . By day’s approach look to be visited .
O weary night , O long and tedious night , Abate thy hours . Shine comforts from the east , That I may back to Athens by daylight From these that my poor company detest . And sleep , that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye , Steal me awhile from mine own company .
Thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor . Oh , let the heavens Give him defense against the elements , For I have lost him on a dangerous sea .
Is he well shipped
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death , Stand in bold cure .
A sail , a sail , a sail
What noise
The town is empty . On the brow o th sea Stand ranks of people , and they cry A sail
My hopes do shape him for the governor .
Oh , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet
That .
O , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence , railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her . I measure him , says she , by my own spirit , for I should flout him if he writ to me , yea , though I love him , I should .
Then down upon her knees she falls , weeps , sobs , beats her heart , tears her hair , prays , curses O sweet Benedick God give me patience
She doth indeed , my daughter says so , and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself . It is very true .
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
They do discharge their shot of courtesy . Our friends at least .
I pray you sir , go forth And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived .
I shall .
To what end He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession one would think it were Mistress Overdone’s own house , for here be many of her old customers . First , here’s young Master Rash he’s in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger , ninescore and seventeen pounds of which he made five marks , ready money marry , then ginger was not much in request , for the old women were all dead . Then is there here one Master Caper , at the suit of Master Three pile the mercer , for some four suits of peach coloured satin , which now peaches him a beggar . Then have we here young Dizzy , and young Master Deep vow , and Master Copperspur , and Master Starve lackey the rapier and dagger man , and young Drop heir that killed lusty Pudding , and Master Forthlight the tilter , and brave Master Shooty the great traveller , and wild Half can that stabbed Pots , and , I think , forty more all great doers in our trade , and are now ‘for the Lord’s sake . ’
An he should , it were an alms to hang him . She’s an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .
And she is exceeding wise .
Sirrah , bring Barnardine hither .
None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th enjoying of my love . There may as well be amity and life Tween snow and fire , as treason and my love .
In every thing but in loving Benedick .
Ay , but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforcèd do speak anything .
Promise me life , and I’ll confess the truth .
Well then , confess and live .
Confess and love Had been the very sum of my confession . O happy torment , when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance But let me to my fortune and the caskets .
Away , then . I am locked in one of them . If you do love me you will find me out . Nerissa and the rest , stand all aloof . Let music sound while he doth make his choice . Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end , Fading in music . That the comparison May stand more proper , my eye shall be the stream And watery deathbed for him . He may win , And what is music then Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new crownèd monarch . Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear And summon him to marriage .
Yet but three Come one more . Two of both kinds make up four . Here she comes , cursed and sad . Cupid is a knavish lad Thus to make poor females mad .
Never so weary , never so in woe , Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers , I can no further crawl , no further go . My legs can keep no pace with my desires . Here will I rest me till the break of day . Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
On the ground Sleep sound . I’ll apply To your eye . Gentle lover , remedy . When thou wakest , Thou takest True delight In the sight Of thy former lady’s eye . And the country proverb known That every man should take his own In your waking shall be shown . Jack shall have Jill . Nought shall go ill . The man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well .
Yet I am doubtful , for I am mainly ignorant What place this is , and all the skill I have Remembers not these garments . Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night . Do not laugh at me , For as I am a man , I think this lady To be my child Cordelia .
And so I am , I am .
Be your tears wet Yes , faith . I pray , weep not . If you have poison for me , I will drink it . I know you do not love me , for your sisters Have , as I do remember , done me wrong . You have some cause they have not .
No cause , no cause .
Am I in France
In your own kingdom , sir .
Do not abuse me .
Be comforted , good madam . The great rage , You see , is killed in him . And yet it is danger To make him even o er the time he has lost . Desire him to go in . Trouble him no more Till further settling .
Will ’t please your highness walk
You must bear with me . Pray you now , forget and forgive . I am old and foolish .
Come , come , my son , I’ll bring thee on thy way Had I thy youth and cause , I would not stay .
Then , England’s ground , farewell sweet soil , adieu My mother , and my nurse , that bears me yet Where’er I wander , boast of this I can , Though banish’d , yet a trueborn Englishman .
As little joy enjoys the queen thereof , For I am she , and altogether joyless . I can no longer hold me patient .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me Which of you trembles not that looks on me If not , that I am queen , you bow like subjects , Yet that , by you deposed , you quake like rebels . Ah , gentle villain , do not turn away .
Foul , wrinkled witch , what mak’st thou in my sight
But repetition of what thou hast marred . That will I make before I let thee go .
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death
I was , but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode . A husband and a son thou ow’st to me And thou a kingdom all of you , allegiance . The sorrow that I have by right is yours , And all the pleasures you usurp are mine .
The curse my noble father laid on thee When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper , And with thy scorns drew’st rivers from his eyes , And then , to dry them , gav’st the duke a clout Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland His curses then , from bitterness of soul Denounced against thee , are all fall n upon thee , And God , not we , hath plagued thy bloody deed .
Come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed While I thy amiable cheeks do coy , And stick musk roses in thy sleek , smooth head , And kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy .
Where’s Peaseblossom
Ready .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom . Where’s Monsieur Cobweb
Ready .
Monsieur Cobweb , good monsieur , get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red hipped humble bee on the top of a thistle . And , good monsieur , bring me the honey bag . Do not fret yourself too much in the action , monsieur . And good monsieur , have a care the honey bag break not . I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag , signor .
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed
Ready .
Master Barnardine you must rise and be hanged . Master Barnardine
What , ho , Barnardine
A pox o’ your throats Who makes that noise there What are you
Your friends , sir the hangman . You must be so good , sir , to rise and be put to death .
Away , you rogue , away I am sleepy .
Tell him he must awake , and that quickly too .
Pray , Master Barnardine , awake till you are executed , and sleep afterwards .
Go in to him , and fetch him out .
He is coming , sir , he is coming I hear his straw rustle .
Is the axe upon the block , sirrah
Very ready , sir .
How now , Abhorson what’s the news with you
Truly , sir , I would desire you to clap into your prayers for , look you , the warrant’s come .
You rogue , I have been drinking all night I am not fitted for ’t .
O , the better , sir for he that drinks all night , and is hanged betimes in the morning , may sleep the sounder all the next day .
Give me your neaf , Monsieur Mustardseed . Pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
What’s your will
Nothing , good monsieur , but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch . I must to the barber’s , monsieur , for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face . And I am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , I must scratch .
What , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love
I have a reasonable good ear in music . Let’s have the tongs and the bones .
Or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
Truly , a peck of provender . I could munch your good dry oats . Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay . Good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts .
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas . But , I pray you , let none of your people stir me . I have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
Sleep thou , and I will wind thee in my arms . Fairies , be gone , and be all ways away .
Holds it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain
Most certain , sir .
Who is conductor of his people
As ’tis said , the bastard son of Gloucester .
They say Edgar , his banished son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
Report is changeable . Tis time to look about . The powers of the kingdom approach apace .
The arbitrament is like to be bloody . Fare you well , sir .
My point and period will be throughly wrought , Or well or ill , as this day’s battle’s fought .
Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides , when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea monster . I stand for sacrifice . The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives , With blearèd visages come forth to view The issue of th exploit . Go , Hercules Live thou , I live . With much , much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray .
Tell me where is fancy bred . Or in the heart or in the head How begot , how nourishèd
Reply , reply .
It is engendered in the eyes , With gazing fed , and fancy dies In the cradle where it lies . Let us all ring fancy’s knell I’ll begin it . Ding , dong , bell .
Ding , dong , bell .
So just is God to right the innocent .
O , ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , And the most merciless that e er was heard of
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
No man but prophesied revenge for it .
Northumberland , then present , wept to see it .
What , were you snarling all before I came , Ready to catch each other by the throat , And turn you all your hatred now on me Did York’s dread curse prevail so much with heaven That Henry’s death , my Lovelly Edward’s death , Their kingdom’s loss , my woeful banishment , Could all but answer for that peevish brat Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven Why then , give way , dull clouds , to my quick curses Though not by war , by surfeit die your king , As ours by murder to make him a king .
Oh , my lord , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory . I am sorry for her , as I have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me . I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself . I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say .
But good lieutenant , is your general wived
Were it good , think you
Most fortunately . He hath achieved a maid That paragons description and wild fame , One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens , And in th essential vesture of creation Does tire the ingener .
Hero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .
How now Who has put in
She doth well . If she should make tender of her love , ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .
Tis one Iago , ancient to the general .
He is a very proper man .
He’s had most favorable and happy speed . Tempests themselves , high seas , and howling winds , The guttered rocks and congregated sands , Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel , As having sense of beauty , do omit Their mortal natures , letting go safely by The divine Desdemona .
He hath indeed a good outward happiness .
What is she
Before God , and in my mind , very wise .
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
She that I spake of , our great captain’s captain , Left in the conduct of the bold Iago , Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se nnight’s speed . Great Jove , Othello guard , And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath , That he may bless this bay with his tall ship , Make love’s quick pants in Desdemona’s arms , Give renewed fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort
And I take him to be valiant .
As Hector , I assure you , and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise , for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christian like fear .
Look you , sir here comes your ghostly father do we jest now , think you
Sir , induced by my charity , and hearing how hastily you are to depart , I am come to advise you , comfort you and pray with you .
Friar , not I I have been drinking hard all night , and I will have more time to prepare me , or they shall beat out my brains with billets I will not consent to die this day , that’s certain .
O , sir , you must and therefore I beseech you Look forward on the journey you shall go .
I swear I will not die to day for any man’s persuasion .
But hear you .
Not a word if you have any thing to say to me , come to my ward for thence will not I to day .
Unfit to live or die O gravel heart After him , fellows bring him to the block .
Now , sir , how do you find the prisoner
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist . The female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm . Oh , how I love thee How I dote on thee
Welcome , good Robin . Seest thou this sweet sight Her dotage now I do begin to pity . For , meeting her of late behind the wood , Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool , I did upbraid her and fall out with her . For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers , And that same dew , which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls , Stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail . When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begged my patience , I then did ask of her her changeling child , Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in Fairyland . And now I have the boy , I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes . And , gentle Puck , take this transformèd scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain , That , he awaking when the other do , May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night’s accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream . But first I will release the fairy queen .
We did observe . Cousin Aumerle , How far brought you high Hereford on his way
I brought high Hereford , if you call him so , But to the next highway , and there I left him .
And say , what store of parting tears were shed
Faith , none for me except the north east wind , Which then blew bitterly against our faces , Awaked the sleeping rheum , and so by chance Did grace our hollow parting with a tear .
What said our cousin when you parted with him
‘Farewell ’ And , for my heart disdained that my tongue Should so profane the word , that taught me craft To counterfeit oppression of such grief That words seem’d buried in my sorrow’s grave . Marry , would the word ‘farewell’ have lengthen’d hours And added years to his short banishment , He should have had a volume of farewells But since it would not , he had none of me .
He is our cousin , cousin but ’tis doubt , When time shall call him home from banishment , Whether our kinsman come to see his friends . Ourself and Bushy , Bagot here and Green Observed his courtship to the common people How he did seem to dive into their hearts With humble and familiar courtesy , What reverence he did throw away on slaves , Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles And patient underbearing of his fortune , As ’twere to banish their affects with him . Off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench A brace of draymen bid God speed him well And had the tribute of his supple knee , With ‘Thanks , my countrymen , my loving friends ’ As were our England in reversion his , And he our subjects’ next degree in hope .
So may the outward shows be least themselves . The world is still deceived with ornament . In law , what plea so tainted and corrupt But , being seasoned with a gracious voice , Obscures the show of evil In religion , What damnèd error , but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text , Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts . How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars , Who , inward searched , have livers white as milk , And these assume but valor’s excrement To render them redoubted . Look on beauty , And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight , Which therein works a miracle in nature , Making them lightest that wear most of it . So are those crispèd snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind , Upon supposèd fairness , often known To be the dowry of a second head , The skull that bred them in the sepulcher . Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore To a most dangerous sea , the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word , The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest . Therefore then , thou gaudy gold , Hard food for Midas , I will none of thee . Nor none of thee , thou pale and common drudge Tween man and man . But thou , thou meagre lead , Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught , Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence , And here choose I . Joy be the consequence
Oh , behold , The riches of the ship is come on shore You men of Cyprus , let her have your knees . Hail to thee , lady , and the grace of heaven , Before , behind thee , and on every hand , Enwheel thee round
Be as thou wast wont to be . See as thou wast wont to see . Dian’s bud o er Cupid’s flower Hath such force and blessèd power . Now , my Titania , wake you , my sweet queen .
My Oberon , what visions have I seen Methought I was enamored of an ass .
I thank you , valiant Cassio . What tidings can you tell me of my lord
There lies your love .
He is not yet arrived . Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here .
How came these things to pass Oh , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
Oh , but I fear . How lost you company
Silence awhile . Robin , take off this head . Titania , music call , and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense .
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship
Music , ho Music such as charmeth sleep
A sail , a sail
But , hark a sail .
Now when thou wakest , with thine own fool’s eyes peep .
They give this greeting to the citadel . This likewise is a friend .
Sound , music Come , my queen , take hands with me , And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be . Now thou and I are new in amity , And will tomorrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly , And bless it to all fair prosperity . There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded , with Theseus , all in jollity .
See for the news .
Good ancient , you are welcome . Welcome , mistress . Let it not gall your patience , good Iago , That I extend my manners . Tis my breeding That gives me this bold show of courtesy .
A creature unprepared , unmeet for death And to transport him in the mind he is Were damnable .
Edward thy son , that now is Prince of Wales , For Edward our son , that was Prince of Wales , Die in his youth by like untimely violence . Thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , Outlive thy glory , like my wretched self . Long mayst thou live to wail thy children’s death And see another , as I see thee now , Decked in thy rights , as thou art stalled in mine . Long die thy happy days before thy death , And , after many lengthened hours of grief , Die neither mother , wife , nor England’s queen . Rivers and Dorset , you were standers by , And so wast thou , Lord Hastings , when my son Was stabbed with bloody daggers . God I pray Him That none of you may live his natural age , But by some unlooked accident cut off .
Here in the prison , father , There died this morning of a cruel fever One Ragozine , a most notorious pirate , A man of Claudio’s years his beard and head Just of his colour . What if we do omit This reprobate till he were well inclined And satisfy the deputy with the visage Of Ragozine , more like to Claudio
Have done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag .
O , ’tis an accident that heaven provides Dispatch it presently the hour draws on Prefix’d by Angelo see this be done , And sent according to command whiles I Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die .
And leave out thee Stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me . If heaven have any grievous plague in store Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee , O , let them keep it till thy sins be ripe And then hurl down their indignation On thee , the troubler of the poor world’s peace . The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul . Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv’st , And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends . No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine , Unless it be while some tormenting dream Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils .
This shall be done , good father , presently . But Barnardine must die this afternoon And how shall we continue Claudio , To save me from the danger that might come If he were known alive
Know of the duke if his last purpose hold , Or whether since he is advised by aught To change the course . He’s full of alteration And self reproving . Bring his constant pleasure .
Let this be done . Put them in secret holds , both Barnardine and Claudio Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting To the under generation , you shall find Your safety manifested .
Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried .
Tis to be doubted , madam .
Now , sweet lord , You know the goodness I intend upon you . Tell me but truly but then speak the truth Do you not love my sister
In honored love .
But have you never found my brother’s way To the forfended place
That thought abuses you .
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers .
No , by mine honor , madam .
How all the other passions fleet to air , As doubtful thoughts , and rash embraced despair , And shuddering fear , and green eyed jealousy O love , be moderate . Allay thy ecstasy . In measure rein thy joy . Scant this excess . I feel too much thy blessing . Make it less , For fear I surfeit .
You that choose not by the view , Chance as fair and choose as true . Since this fortune falls to you , Be content and seek no new . If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss , Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss .
If he do fear God , he must necessarily keep peace . If he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
And so will he do , for the man doth fear God , howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make . Well , I am sorry for your niece . Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love
Never tell him , my lord , let her wear it out with good counsel .
Nay , that’s impossible . She may wear her heart out first .
Well , we will hear further of it by your daughter . Let it cool the while . I love Benedick well , and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady .
My lord , will you walk Dinner is ready .
If he do not dote on her upon this , I will never trust my expectation .
Let there be the same net spread for her , and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry . The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage , and no such matter . That’s the scene that I would see , which will be merely a dumb show . Let us send her to call him in to dinner .
Fairy King , attend , and mark . I do hear the morning lark .
Then , my queen , in silence sad , Trip we after the night’s shade . We the globe can compass soon Swifter than the wandering moon .
Come , my lord , and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground .
Go , one of you , find out the forester . For now our observation is performed . And since we have the vaward of the day , My love shall hear the music of my hounds . Uncouple in the western valley . Let them go . Dispatch , I say , and find the forester .
We will , fair queen , up to the mountain’s top , And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction .
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once , When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta . Never did I hear Such gallant chiding . For , besides the groves ,
Well , he is gone and with him go these thoughts . Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland , Expedient manage must be made , my liege , Ere further leisure yield them further means For their advantage and your highness’ loss .
We will ourself in person to this war And , for our coffers , with too great a court And liberal largess , are grown somewhat light , We are inforced to farm our royal realm The revenue whereof shall furnish us For our affairs in hand if that come short , Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters Whereto , when they shall know what men are rich , They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold And send them after to supply our wants For we will make for Ireland presently .
Bushy , what news
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick , my lord , Suddenly taken and hath sent post haste To entreat your majesty to visit him .
Where lies he
At Ely House .
Sir , would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me , You’ll have enough .
Alas , she has no speech
In faith , too much . I find it still , when I have leave to sleep . Marry , before your ladyship , I grant , She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking .
You have little cause to say so .
Come on , come on . You are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .
Oh , fie upon thee , slanderer
Nay , it is true , or else I am a Turk . You rise to play and go to bed to work .
You shall not write my praise .
No , let me not .
What wouldst thou write of me , if thou should’st praise me
A gentle scroll . Fair lady , by your leave , I come by note to give and to receive . Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes , Hearing applause and universal shout , Giddy in spirit , still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no So , thrice fair lady , stand I even so , As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed , signed , ratified by you .
You see me , Lord Bassanio , where I stand Such as I am . Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better , yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair , ten thousand times more rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue , beauties , livings , friends Exceed account . But the full sum of me Is sum of something which , to term in gross , Is an unlessoned girl , unschooled , unpracticèd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn . Happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn . Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord , her governor , her king . Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted . But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion , master of my servants , Queen o er myself . And even now , but now , This house , these servants , and this same myself Are yours , my lord’s . I give them with this ring , Which when you part from , lose , or give away , Let it presage the ruin of your love
I never shall endure her . Dear my lord , Be not familiar with her .
Fear me not . She and the duke her husband
I had rather lose the battle than that sister Should loosen him and me .
Our very loving sister , well bemet . Sir , this I hear the king is come to his daughter , With others whom the rigor of our state Forced to cry out . Where I could not be honest I never yet was valiant . For this business , It touches us as France invades our land , Not bolds the king , with others whom I fear Most just and heavy causes make oppose .
Sir , you speak nobly .
Why is this reasoned
Combine together gainst the enemy , For these domestic and particular broils Are not the question here .
Let’s then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings .
Now put it , God , in the physician’s mind To help him to his grave immediately The lining of his coffers shall make coats To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars . Come , gentlemen , let’s all go visit him Pray God we may make haste , and come too late
I shall attend you presently at your tent .
Amen .
Sister , you’ll go with us
O gentle lady , do not put me to ’t , For I am nothing , if not critical .
Come on , assay . There’s one gone to the harbor
Ay , madam .
I am not merry , but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise . Come , how wouldst thou praise me
I am about it , but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze , It plucks out brains and all . But my Muse labors And thus she is delivered If she be fair and wise , fairness and wit , The one’s for use , the other useth it .
Well praised How if she be black and witty
If she be black , and thereto have a wit , She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit .
Worse and worse
How if fair and foolish
She never yet was foolish that was fair , For even her folly helped her to an heir .
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i th alehouse . What miserable praise hast thou for her That’s foul and foolish
There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto , But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do .
The skies , the fountains , every region near Seemed all one mutual cry . I never heard So musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
And be my vantage to exclaim on you .
Madam , you have bereft me of all words . Only my blood speaks to you in my veins . And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a belovèd prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleasèd multitude , Where every something , being blent together , Turns to a wild of nothing , save of joy , Expressed and not expressed . But when this ring Parts from this finger , then parts life from hence . O , then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead
My lord and lady , it is now our time , That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper , To cry , Good joy , good joy , my lord and lady
My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady , I wish you all the joy that you can wish , For I am sure you can wish none from me . And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith , I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too .
With all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
I thank your lordship , you have got me one . My eyes , my lord , can look as swift as yours . You saw the mistress , I beheld the maid . You loved , I loved . For intermission No more pertains to me , my lord , than you . Your fortune stood upon the casket there , And so did mine too , as the matter falls . For wooing here until I sweat again , And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love , at last if promise last I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love , provided that your fortune Achieved her mistress .
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind , So flewed , so sanded , and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew , Crook kneed , and dew lapped like Thessalian bulls , Slow in pursuit , but matched in mouth like bells , Each under each . A cry more tunable Was never hollaed to , nor cheered with horn , In Crete , in Sparta , nor in Thessaly . Judge when you hear . But , soft What nymphs are these
My lord , this is my daughter here asleep . And this , Lysander . This Demetrius is . This Helena , old Nedar’s Helena . I wonder of their being here together .
No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May , and hearing our intent Came here in grace our solemnity . But speak , Egeus . Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice
It is , my lord .
Go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
Good morrow , friends . Saint Valentine is past .
Thou elvish marked , abortive , rooting hog , Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity The slave of nature and the son of hell , Thou slander of thy heavy mother’s womb , Thou loathèd issue of thy father’s loins , Thou rag of honor , thou detested
Margaret .
Richard
Ha
I call thee not .
I cry thee mercy , then , for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names .
Why , so I did , but looked for no reply . O , let me make the period to my curse
Tis done by me , and ends in Margaret .
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
Poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider , Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about Fool , fool , thou whet’st a knife to kill thyself . The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch backed toad .
False boding woman , end thy frantic curse , Lest to thy harm thou move our patience .
This can be no trick . The conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from Hero they seem to pity the lady . It seems her affections have their full bent . Love me Why , it must be requited I hear how I am censured . They sy I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her . They say , too , that she will rather die than give any sign of affection . I did never think to marry . I must not seem proud . Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending . They say the lady is fair ’tis a truth , I can bear them witness . And virtuous ’tis so , I cannot reprove it . And wise , but for loving me by my troth , it is no addition to her wit , nor no great argument of her folly , for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage , but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age . Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor No The world must be peopled . When I said I would die a bachelor , I did not think I should live till I were married . Here comes Beatrice . By this day , she’s a fair lady . I do spy some marks of love in her .
Against my will , I am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
Fair Beatrice , I thank you for your pains .
No .
Tis most convenient . Pray you , go with us .
Oh ho , I know the riddle . I will go .
If e er your grace had speech with man so poor , Hear me one word .
I’ll overtake you .
Speak .
Before you fight the battle , ope this letter . If you have victory , let the trumpet sound For him that brought it . Wretched though I seem , I can produce a champion that will prove What is avouchèd there . If you miscarry , Your business of the world hath so an end , And machination ceases . Fortune love you .
Stay till I have read the letter .
I was forbid it . When time shall serve , let but the herald cry , And I’ll appear again .
Why , fare thee well . I will o erlook thy paper .
I am your free dependant .
Quick , dispatch , and send the head to Angelo .
Now will I write letters to Angelo , The provost , he shall bear them , whose contents Shall witness to him I am near at home , And that , by great injunctions , I am bound To enter publicly him I’ll desire To meet me at the consecrated fount A league below the city and from thence , By cold gradation and well balanced form , We shall proceed with Angelo .
Here is the head I’ll carry it myself .
Convenient is it . Make a swift return For I would commune with you of such things That want no ear but yours .
Will the king come , that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
I’ll make all speed .
Vex not yourself , nor strive not with your breath For all in vain comes counsel to his ear .
Peace , ho , be here
O , but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony Where words are scarce , they are seldom spent in vain , For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain . He that no more must say is listen’d more Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose More are men’s ends mark’d than their lives before The setting sun , and music at the close , As the last taste of sweets , is sweetest last , Writ in remembrance more than things long past Though Richard my life’s counsel would not hear , My death’s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear .
The tongue of Isabel . She’s come to know If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither But I will keep her ignorant of her good , To make her heavenly comforts of despair , When it is least expected .
No it is stopp’d with other flattering sounds , As praises , of whose taste the wise are feared , Lascivious metres , to whose venom sound The open ear of youth doth always listen Report of fashions in proud Italy , Whose manners still our tardy apish nation Limps after in base imitation . Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity So it be new , there’s no respect how vile That is not quickly buzzed into his ears Then all too late comes counsel to be heard , Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard . Direct not him whose way himself will choose ’Tis breath thou lack’st , and that breath wilt thou lose .
Oh , heavy ignorance Thou praisest the worst best . But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
She that was ever fair and never proud , Had tongue at will and yet was never loud , Never lacked gold and yet went never gay , Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may , She that being angered , her revenge being nigh , Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail , She that could think and ne er disclose her mind , See suitors following and not look behind , She was a wight , if ever such wights were
To do what
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
Oh , most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn of him , Emilia , though he be thy husband . How say you , Cassio Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor
He speaks home , madam . You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
He takes her by the palm . Ay , well said , whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio . Ay , smile upon her , do , I will gyve thee in thine own courtship . You say true , Tis so , indeed .
Foul shame upon you , you have all moved mine .
Were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
To serve me well , you all should do me duty Teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects . O , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty
The enemy’s in view . Draw up your powers . Here is the guess of their true strength and forces By diligent discovery , but your haste Is now urged on you .
Dispute not with her she is lunatic .
We will greet the time .
Peace , Master Marquess , you are malapert . Your fire new stamp of honor is scarce current . O , that your young nobility could judge What ’twere to lose it and be miserable They that stand high have many blasts to shake them , And if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .
Good counsel , marry . Learn it , learn it , marquess .
To both these sisters have I sworn my love , Each jealous of the other as the stung Are of the adder . Which of them shall I take Both One Or neither Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive . To take the widow Exasperates , makes mad her sister Goneril , And hardly shall I carry out my side , Her husband being alive . Now , then , we’ll use His countenance for the battle , which being done , Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off . As for the mercy Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia , The battle done and they within our power , Shall never see his pardon , for my state Stands on me to defend , not to debate .
It touches you , my lord , as much as me .
Ay , and much more but I was born so high . Our aerie buildeth in the cedar’s top , And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun .
And turns the sun to shade . Alas , alas , Witness my son , now in the shade of death , Whose bright out shining beams thy cloudy wrath Hath in eternal darkness folded up . Your aerie buildeth in our aerie’s nest . O God , that seest it , do not suffer it As it was won with blood , lost be it so .
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired And thus expiring do foretell of him His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last , For violent fires soon burn out themselves Small showers last long , but sudden storms are short He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder Light vanity , insatiate cormorant , Consuming means , soon preys upon itself . This royal throne of kings , this scepter’d isle , This earth of majesty , this seat of Mars , This other Eden , demi paradise , This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war , This happy breed of men , this little world , This precious stone set in the silver sea , Which serves it in the office of a wall , Or as a moat defensive to a house , Against the envy of less happier lands , This blessed plot , this earth , this realm , this England , This nurse , this teeming womb of royal kings , Fear’d by their breed and famous by their birth , Renowned for their deeds as far from home , For Christian service and true chivalry , As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry , Of the world’s ransom , blessed Mary’s Son , This land of such dear souls , this dear dear land , Dear for her reputation through the world , Is now leased out , I die pronouncing it , Like to a tenement or pelting farm England , bound in with the triumphant sea Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of watery Neptune , is now bound in with shame , With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds That England , that was wont to conquer others , Hath made a shameful conquest of itself . Ah , would the scandal vanish with my life , How happy then were my ensuing death
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me . If it had been painful , I would not have come .
You take pleasure then in the message
Yea , just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal . You have no stomach , Signior . Fare you well .
Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner . There’s a double meaning in that . I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me . That’s as much as to say , Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks . If I do not take pity of her , I am a villain . If I do not love her , I am a Jew . I will go get her picture .
Here , father , take the shadow of this tree For your good host . Pray that the right may thrive . If ever I return to you again , I’ll bring you comfort .
Grace go with you , sir .
Away , old man . Give me thy hand . Away King Lear hath lost , he and his daughter ta en . Give me thy hand . Come on .
No further , sir . A man may rot even here .
What , in ill thoughts again Men must endure Their going hence even as their coming hither . Ripeness is all . Come on .
And that’s true too .
Begin these woodbirds but to couple now
Pardon , my lord .
I pray you all , stand up .
I know you two are rival enemies . How comes this gentle concord in the world , That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmity
My lord , I shall reply amazèdly , Half sleep , half waking . But as yet , I swear , I cannot truly say how I came here . But as I think for truly would I speak , And now do I bethink me , so it is I came with Hermia hither . Our intent Was to be gone from Athens , where we might , Without the peril of the Athenian law
Enough , enough , my lord . You have enough I beg the law , the law , upon his head . They would have stol n away , they would , Demetrius , Thereby to have defeated you and me , You of your wife and me of my consent , Of my consent that she should be your wife .
Ho , by your leave
My lord , fair Helen told me of their stealth , Of this their purpose hither to this wood . And I in fury hither followed them , Fair Helena in fancy following me .
Good morning to you , fair and gracious daughter .
The better , given me by so holy a man . Hath yet the deputy sent my brother’s pardon
He hath released him , Isabel , from the world His head is off and sent to Angelo .
Peace , peace , for shame , if not for charity .
Nay , but it is not so .
It is no other show your wisdom , daughter , In your close patience .
Urge neither charity nor shame to me . Uncharitably with me have you dealt , And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered . My charity is outrage , life my shame , And in that shame still live my sorrows rage .
O , I will to him and pluck out his eyes
Have done , have done .
You shall not be admitted to his sight .
O princely Buckingham , I’ll kiss thy hand In sign of league and amity with thee . Now fair befall thee and thy noble house Thy garments are not spotted with our blood , Nor thou within the compass of my curse .
Is this true , Nerissa
Unhappy Claudio wretched Isabel Injurious world most damned Angelo
Madam , it is , so you stand pleased withal .
And do you , Gratiano , mean good faith
Nor no one here , for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air .
I will not think but they ascend the sky , And there awake God’s gentle sleeping peace . O Buckingham , take heed of yonder dog Look when he fawns , he bites and when he bites , His venom tooth will rankle to the death . Have not to do with him . Beware of him . Sin , death , and hell have set their marks on him , And all their ministers attend on him .
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot Forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven . Mark what I say , which you shall find By every syllable a faithful verity The duke comes home to morrow nay , dry your eyes One of our convent , and his confessor , Gives me this instance already he hath carried Notice to Escalus and Angelo , Who do prepare to meet him at the gates , There to give up their power . If you can , pace your wisdom In that good path that I would wish it go , And you shall have your bosom on this wretch , Grace of the duke , revenges to your heart , And general honour .
Yes , faith , my lord .
Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage .
What doth she say , my lord of Buckingham
We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats .
Nothing that I respect , my gracious lord .
What , and stake down
No , we shall ne er win at that sport and stake down . But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel What , and my old Venetian friend Salerio
Lorenzo and Salerio , welcome hither , If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome . By your leave , I bid my very friends and countrymen , Sweet Portia , welcome .
If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft , which now again you are most apt to play the sir in . Very good , well kissed , and excellent courtesy ’tis so , indeed . Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clyster pipes for your sake
The Moor I know his trumpet .
Tis truly so .
Let’s meet him and receive him .
Lo , where he comes
Oh my fair warrior
My dear Othello
The king is come deal mildly with his youth For young hot colts being raged do rage the more .
How fares our noble uncle , Lancaster
What comfort , man how is’t with aged Gaunt
O how that name befits my composition Old Gaunt indeed , and gaunt in being old Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt For sleeping England long time have I watch’d Watching breeds leanness , leanness is all gaunt The pleasure that some fathers feed upon , Is my strict fast I mean , my children’s looks And therein fasting , hast thou made me gaunt Gaunt am I for the grave , gaunt as a grave , Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones .
Can sick men play so nicely with their names
No , misery makes sport to mock itself Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me , I mock my name , great king , to flatter thee .
Should dying men flatter with those that live
Good Margaret , run thee to the parlor . There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio . Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse Is all of her . Say that thou overheardst us , And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter , like favorites Made proud by princes , that advance their pride Against that power that bred it . There will she hide her To listen our propose . This is thy office . Bear thee well in it and leave us alone .
No , no , men living flatter those that die .
Thou , now a dying , say’st thou flatterest me .
I’ll make her come , I warrant you , presently .
Now , Ursula , when Beatrice doth come , As we do trace this alley up and down , Our talk must only be of Benedick . When I do name him , let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit . My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice . Of this matter Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made , That only wounds by hearsay .
Some officers take them away . Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them .
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me . Oh , my soul’s joy If after every tempest come such calms , May the winds blow till they have wakened death , And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus high , and duck again as low As hell’s from heaven If it were now to die , Twere now to be most happy , for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate .
We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurred the worst . For thee , oppressèd King , I am cast down . Myself could else outfrown false fortune’s frown . Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters
No , no , no , no Come , let’s away to prison . We two alone will sing like birds i th cage . When thou dost ask me blessing , I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness . So we’ll live , And pray , and sing , and tell old tales , and laugh At gilded butterflies , and hear poor rogues Talk of court news , and we’ll talk with them too Who loses and who wins , who’s in , who’s out And take upon ’s the mystery of things As if we were God’s spies . And we’ll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon .
Take them away .
Upon such sacrifices , my Cordelia , The gods themselves throw incense . Have I caught thee He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes . Wipe thine eyes .
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase , Even as our days do grow .
So do I , my lord . They are entirely welcome .
I thank your honor . For my part , my lord , My purpose was not to have seen you here . But meeting with Salerio by the way , He did entreat me , past all saying nay , To come with him along .
I am directed by you .
This letter , then , to Friar Peter give ’Tis that he sent me of the duke’s return Say , by this token , I desire his company At Mariana’s house to night . Her cause and yours I’ll perfect him withal , and he shall bring you Before the duke , and to the head of Angelo Accuse him home and home . For my poor self , I am combined by a sacred vow And shall be absent . Wend you with this letter Command these fretting waters from your eyes With a light heart trust not my holy order , If I pervert your course . Who’s here
I did , my lord . And I have reason for it . Signor Antonio Commends him to you .
Ere I ope his letter , I pray you tell me how my good friend doth .
Not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , Nor well , unless in mind . His letter there Will show you his estate .
Good even . Friar , where’s the provost
Not within , sir .
O pretty Isabella , I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient . I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to ’t . But they say the duke will be here to morrow . By my troth , Isabel , I loved thy brother if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home , he had lived .
Nerissa , cheer yond stranger . Bid her welcome . Your hand , Salerio . What’s the news from Venice How doth that royal merchant , good Antonio I know he will be glad of our success . We are the Jasons , we have won the fleece .
But , my good lord , I wot not by what power But by some power it is my love to Hermia , Melted as the snow , seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon . And all the faith , the virtue of my heart , The object and the pleasure of mine eye , Is only Helena . To her , my lord , Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia . But like in sickness did I loathe this food . But as in health , come to my natural taste , Now I do wish it , love it , long for it , And will for evermore be true to it .
Fair lovers , you are fortunately met . Of this discourse we more will hear anon . Egeus , I will overbear your will . For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit . And , for the morning now is something worn , Our purposed hunting shall be set aside . Away with us to Athens . Three and three , We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity . Come , Hippolyta .
These things seem small and undistinguishable , Like far off mountains turnèd into clouds .
When everything seems double . Methinks I see these things with parted eye ,
So methinks .
The good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , Ere they shall make us weep . We’ll see em starve first . Come .
What , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , And soothe the devil that I warn thee from O , but remember this another day , When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow , And say poor Margaret was a prophetess . Live each of you the subjects to his hate , And he to yours , and all of you to God’s .
Come hither , captain . Hark . Take thou this note . Go follow them to prison . One step I have advanced thee . If thou dost As this instructs thee , thou dost make thy way To noble fortunes . Know thou this that men Are as the time is . To be tender minded Does not become a sword . Thy great employment Will not bear question . Either say thou lt do ’t , Or thrive by other means .
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .
And so doth mine . I muse why she’s at liberty .
I cannot blame her . By God’s holy mother , She hath had too much wrong , and I repent My part thereof that I have done to her .
I never did her any , to my knowledge .
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong . I was too hot to do somebody good That is too cold in thinking of it now . Marry , as for Clarence , he is well repaid He is franked up to fatting for his pains . God pardon them that are the cause thereof .
A virtuous and a Christian like conclusion To pray for them that have done scathe to us .
I’ll do ’t , my lord .
About it , and write happy when thou’st done . Mark , I say , instantly , and carry it so As I have set it down .
I cannot draw a cart , nor eat dried oats . If it be man’s work , I’ll do ’t .
Sir , the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is , he lives not in them .
Friar , thou knowest not the duke so well as I do he’s a better woodman than thou takest him for .
Sir , you have shown today your valiant strain , And fortune led you well . You have the captives That were the opposites of this day’s strife .
Well , you’ll answer this one day . Fare ye well .
Nay , tarry I’ll go along with thee I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke .
You have told me too many of him already , sir , if they be true if not true , none were enough .
So do I ever being well advised , For had I cursed now , I had cursed myself .
I was once before him for getting a wench with child .
Did you such a thing
Yes , marry , did I but I was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar .
Sir , your company is fairer than honest . Rest you well .
By my troth , I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end if bawdy talk offend you , we’ll have very little of it . Nay , friar , I am a kind of burr I shall stick .
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost .
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek . Some dear friend dead , else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man . What , worse and worse With leave , Bassanio , I am half yourself , And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you .
O sweet Portia , Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper . Gentle lady , When I did first impart my love to you , I freely told you , all the wealth I had Ran in my veins . I was a gentleman , And then I told you true . And yet , dear lady , Rating myself at nothing , you shall see How much I was a braggart . When I told you My state was nothing , I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing , for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend , Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means . Here is a letter , lady , The paper as the body of my friend , And every word in it a gaping wound , Issuing life blood . But is it true , Salerio Have all his ventures failed What , not one hit From Tripolis , from Mexico and England , From Lisbon , Barbary , and India And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch Of merchant marring rocks
Now begin , For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground , to hear our conference .
The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait . So angle we for Beatrice , who even now Is couchèd in the woodbine coverture . Fear you not my part of the dialogue .
No , truly , Ursula , she is too disdainful . I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock .
Amen to that , sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content . It stops me here , it is too much of joy . And this , and this , the greatest discords be That e er our hearts shall make
Oh , you are well tuned now , But I’ll set down the pegs that make this music , As honest as I am .
Come , let us to the castle . News , friends Our wars are done , the Turks are drowned . How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey , you shall be well desired in Cyprus , I have found great love amongst them . O my sweet , I prattle out of fashion , and I dote In mine own comforts . I prithee , good Iago , Go to the bay and disembark my coffers . Bring thou the master to the citadel . He is a good one , and his worthiness Does challenge much respect . Come , Desdemona , Once more , well met at Cyprus .
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely
So says the Prince and my new trothèd lord .
And did they bid you tell her of it , madam
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it , But I persuaded them , if they loved Benedick , To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it .
Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor . Come hither . If thou be’st valiant , as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them , list me . The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard . First , I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him .
Madam , his majesty doth call for you , And for your Grace , and yours , my gracious lords .
Catesby , I come . Lords , will you go with me
We wait upon your Grace .
I do the wrong , and first begin to brawl . The secret mischiefs that I set abroach I lay unto the grievous charge of others . Clarence , whom I indeed have cast in darkness , I do beweep to many simple gulls , Namely , to Derby , Hastings , Buckingham , And tell them ’tis the queen and her allies That stir the king against the duke my brother . Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers , Dorset , Grey But then I sigh and , with a piece of scripture , Tell them that God bids us do good for evil And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ , And seem a saint when most I play the devil .
But , soft here come my executioners . How now , my hardy , stout , resolvèd mates Are you now going to dispatch this thing
O , no thou diest , though I the sicker be .
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other .
We are , my lord , and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is .
In most uneven and distracted manner . His actions show much like to madne pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted And why meet him at the gates , and redeliver our authorities there
I guess not .
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering , that if any crave redress of injustice , they should exhibit their petitions in the street
He shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints , and to deliver us from devices hereafter , which shall then have no power to stand against us .
Well , I beseech you , let it be proclaimed betimes i’ the morn I’ll call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him .
I shall , sir . Fare you well .
Good night .
This deed unshapes me quite , makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings . A deflower’d maid And by an eminent body that enforced The law against it But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss , How might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no For my authority bears of a credent bulk , That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather . He should have lived , Save that riotous youth , with dangerous sense , Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge , By so receiving a dishonour’d life With ransom of such shame . Would yet he had lived A lack , when once our grace we have forgot , Nothing goes right we would , and we would nota reference to Romans 7 15we would , and we would not .
I am in health , I breathe , and see thee ill .
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel , Mine own , and not mine own .
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill Ill in myself to see , and in thee seeing ill . Thy death bed is no lesser than thy land Wherein thou liest in reputation sick And thou , too careless patient as thou art , Commit’st thy anointed body to the cure Of those physicians that first wounded thee A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown , Whose compass is no bigger than thy head And yet , incaged in so small a verge , The waste is no whit lesser than thy land . O , had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons , From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame , Deposing thee before thou wert possess’d , Which art possess’d now to depose thyself . Why , cousin , wert thou regent of the world , It were a shame to let this land by lease But for thy world enjoying but this land , Is it not more than shame to shame it so Landlord of England art thou now , not king Thy state of law is bondslave to the law And thou
Are you sure That we are awake It seems to me That yet we sleep , we dream . Do not you think The duke was here , and bid us follow him
Yea , and my father .
And Hippolyta .
And he did bid us follow to the temple .
Why then , we are awake . Let’s follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams .
When my cue comes , call me , and I will answer . My next is Most fair Pyramus . Heigh ho Peter Quince Flute the bellows mender Snout the tinker Starveling God’s my life , stol n hence , and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision . I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was . Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream . Methought I was there is no man can tell what . Methought I was , and methought I had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had . The eye of man hath not heard , the ear of man hath not seen , man’s hand is not able to taste , his tongue to conceive , nor his heart to report what my dream was . I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream .
I do require them of you , so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine .
Sir , I thought it fit To send the old and miserable king To some retention and appointed guard Whose age has charms in it , whose title more To pluck the common bosom on his side , An turn our impressed lances in our eyes Which do command them . With him I sent the queen , My reason all the same , and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t appear Where you shall hold your session . At this time We sweat and bleed . The friend hath lost his friend , And the best quarrels , in the heat , are cursed By those that feel their sharpness . The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place .
I hold you but a subject of this war , Not as a brother .
That’s as we list to grace him . Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded Ere you had spoke so far . He led our powers , Bore the commission of my place and person The which immediacy may well stand up And call itself your brother .
Not so hot . In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition .
In my rights , By me invested , he compeers the best .
Not one , my lord . Besides , it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew , He would not take it . Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man . He plies the duke at morning and at night , And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice . Twenty merchants , The duke himself , and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him . But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture , of justice , and his bond .
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus , his countrymen , That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him . And I know , my lord , If law , authority , and power deny not , It will go hard with poor Antonio .
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
It shall be called Bottom’s Dream because it hath no bottom . And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke . Peradventure , to make it the more gracious , I shall sing it at her death .
The dearest friend to me , the kindest man , The best conditioned and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies , and one in whom The ancient Roman honor more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy .
What sum owes he the Jew
For me , three thousand ducats .
O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man , But Nature never framed a woman’s heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice . Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes , Misprizing what they look on , and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak . She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self endeared .
With him Why , ’tis not possible .
Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed . Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor , but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies . To love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it . Her eye must be fed , and what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be a game to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite , loveliness in favor , sympathy in years , manners and beauties . All which the Moor is defective in . Now for want of these required conveniences , her delicate tenderness will find itself abused , begin to heave the gorge , disrelish and abhor the Moor . Very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice . Now sir , this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does A knave very voluble , no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming , for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection . Why , none , why , none A slipper and subtle knave , a finder of occasions that has an eye , can stamp and counterfeit advantages , though true advantage never present itself . A devilish knave . Besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after . A pestilent complete knave , and the woman hath found him already .
I cannot believe that in her . She’s full of most blessed condition .
Blessed fig’s end The wine she drinks is made of grapes . If she had been blessed , she would never have loved the Moor . Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that
Sure , I think so , And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love , lest she make sport at it .
Why , you speak truth . I never yet saw man , How wise , how noble , young , how rarely featured But she would spell him backward . If fair faced , She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black , why , Nature , drawing of an antic , Made a foul blot if tall , a lance ill headed If low , an agate very vilely cut If speaking , why , a vane blown with all winds If silent , why , a block moved with none . So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth .
Sure , sure , such carping is not commendable .
No , not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is , cannot be commendable . But who dare tell her so If I should speak , She would mock me into air . O , she would laugh me Out of myself , press me to death with wit .
Well thought upon . I have it here about me . He gives a paper When you have done , repair to Crosby Place . But , sirs , be sudden in the execution , Withal obdurate do not hear him plead , For Clarence is well spoken and perhaps May move your hearts to pity if you mark him .
Tut , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate . Talkers are no good doers . Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues .
Your eyes drop millstones , when fools eyes drop tears . I like you lads . About your business straight . Go , go , dispatch .
We will , my noble lord .
Have you sent to Bottom’s house Is he come home yet
He cannot be heard of . Out of doubt he is transported .
If he come not , then the play is marred . It goes not forward . Doth it
It is not possible . You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he .
No , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens .
Yea , and the best person too . And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
You must say paragon . A paramour is , God bless us , a thing of naught .
Masters , the duke is coming from the temple , and there is two or three lords and ladies more married . If our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life . He could not have ’scaped sixpence a day . An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus , I’ll be hanged .
That were the most if he should husband you .
Jesters do oft prove prophets .
Holla , holla That eye that told you so looked but asquint .
Lady , I am not well , else I should answer From a full flowing stomach . General , Take thou my soldiers , prisoners , patrimony . Dispose of them , of me . The walls is thine . Witness the world that I create thee here My lord and master .
Mean you to enjoy him then
The let alone lies not in your good will .
Nor in thine , lord .
Half blooded fellow , yes .
Let the drum strike and prove my title thine .
Stay yet . Hear reason . Edmund , I arrest thee On capital treason , and in thine attaint This gilded serpent . For your claim , fair sister , I bar it in the interest of my wife . Tis she is subcontracted to this lord . And I , her husband , contradict your banns . If you will marry , make your loves to me , My lady is bespoke .
A lunatic lean witted fool , Presuming on an ague’s privilege , Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek , chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence . Now , by my seat’s right royal majesty , Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son , This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders .
O , spare me not , my brother Edward’s son , For that I was his father Edward’s son That blood already , like the pelican , Hast thou tapp’d out and drunkenly caroused My brother Gloucester , plain well meaning soul , Whom fair befal in heaven ’mongst happy souls May be a precedent and witness good That thou respect’st not spilling Edward’s blood Join with the present sickness that I have And thy unkindness be like crooked age , To crop at once a too long wither’d flower . Live in thy shame , but die not shame with thee These words hereafter thy tormentors be Convey me to my bed , then to my grave Love they to live that love and honour have .
These letters at fit time deliver me
Therefore let Benedick , like covered fire , Consume away in sighs , waste inwardly . It were a better death than die with mocks , Which is as bad as die with tickling .
Yet tell her of it . Hear what she will say .
The provost knows our purpose and our plot . The matter being afoot , keep your instruction , And hold you ever to our special drift Though sometimes you do blench from this to that , As cause doth minister . Go call at Flavius’ house , And tell him where I stay give the like notice To Valentinus , Rowland , and to Crassus , And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate But send me Flavius first .
No , rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with . One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking .
It shall be speeded well .
An interlude
O , do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment , Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have , as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick .
Thou art armed , Gloucester . Let the trumpet sound . If none appear to prove upon thy person Thy heinous , manifest , and many treasons , There is my pledge . I’ll make it on thy heart , Ere I taste bread , thou art in nothing less Than I have here proclaimed thee .
I thank thee , Varrius thou hast made good haste Come , we will walk . There’s other of our friends Will greet us here anon , my gentle Varrius .
He is the only man of Italy , Always excepted my dear Claudio .
I pray you , be not angry with me , madam , Speaking my fancy . Signor Benedick , For shape , for bearing , argument and valor , Goes foremost in report through Italy .
Indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
His excellence did earn it , ere he had it . When are you married , madam
Yes , that I did , but that was but courtesy .
Lechery , by this hand , an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts . They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together . Villainous thoughts , Roderigo When these mutabilities so marshal the way , hard at hand comes the master and main exercise , th incorporate conclusion . Pish But , sir , be you ruled by me . I have brought you from Venice . Watch you tonight for the command , I’ll lay ’t upon you . Cassio knows you not . I’ll not be far from you . Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .
Well .
Sir , he’s rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you . Provoke him that he may . For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio . So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them , and the impediment most profitably removed , without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity .
I will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity .
I warrant thee . Meet me by and by at the citadel . I must fetch his necessaries ashore . Farewell .
Adieu .
Sick , oh , sick
If not , I’ll ne er trust medicine .
There’s my exchange . What in the world he is That names me traitor , villainlike he lies . Call by thy trumpet . He that dares approach , On him on you , who not I will maintain My truth and honor firmly .
A herald , ho
A herald , ho , a herald
Trust to thy single virtue , for thy soldiers , All levied in my name , have in my name Took their discharge .
My sickness grows upon me .
She is not well . Convey her to my tent .
What , no more Pay him six thousand and deface the bond Double six thousand , and then treble that , Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault . First go with me to church and call me wife , And then away to Venice to your friend . For never shall you lie by Portia’s side With an unquiet soul . You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over . When it is paid , bring your true friend along . My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows . Come , away For you shall hence upon your wedding day . Bid your friends welcome , show a merry cheer . Since you are dear bought , I will love you dear . But let me hear the letter of your friend .
Sweet Bassanio , my ships have all miscarried . My creditors grow cruel . My estate is very low . My bond to the Jew is forfeit . And since in paying it , it is impossible I should live , all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death . Notwithstanding , use your pleasure . If your love do not persuade you to come , let not my letter .
O love , dispatch all business and be gone
Since I have your good leave to go away , I will make haste . But till I come again , No bed shall e er be guilty of my stay , No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain .
Why looks your grace so heavily today
O , I have passed a miserable night , So full of ugly dreams , of ugly sights , That , as I am a Christian faithful man , I would not spend another such a night Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days , So full of dismal terror was the time .
What was your dream , my lord I pray you tell me .
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy , And in my company my brother Gloucester , Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches . Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times , During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall n us . As we paced along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches , Methought that Gloucester stumbled , and in falling Struck me , that thought to stay him , overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main . O Lord , methought what pain it was to drown , What dreadful noise of waters in my ears , What sights of ugly death within my eyes . Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks , A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon , Wedges of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , Inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , All scattered in the bottom of the sea .
He would have deserved it . Sixpence a day in Pyramus , or nothing .
Where are these lads Where are these hearts
Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour
Masters , I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what , for if I tell you I am no true Athenian . I will tell you everything , right as it fell out .
Let us hear , sweet Bottom .
Not a word of me . All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined . Get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps . Meet presently at the palace . Every man look o er his part . For the short and the long is , our play is preferred . In any case , let Thisbe have clean linen . And let not him that plays the lion pair his nails , for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws . And most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath . And I do not doubt but to hear them say , It is a sweet comedy . No more words . Away , go away
Why , every day , tomorrow . Come , go in . I’ll show thee some attires , and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow .
Some lay in dead men’s skulls , and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit , there were crept As ’twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems , That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by .
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep
She’s limed , I warrant you . We have caught her , madam .
Methought I had , and often did I strive To yield the ghost , but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty , vast , and wand ring air , But smothered it within my panting bulk , Who almost burst to belch it in the sea .
If it proves so , then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows , some with traps .
Awaked you not in this sore agony
What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much Contempt , farewell , and maiden pride , adieu No glory lives behind the back of such . And Benedick , love on I will requite thee , Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand . If thou dost love , my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band . For others say thou dost deserve , and I Believe it better than reportingly .
No , no , my dream was lengthened after life . O , then began the tempest to my soul . I passed , methought , the melancholy flood , With that sour ferryman which poets write of , Unto the kingdom of perpetual night . The first that there did greet my stranger soul Was my great father in law , renownèd Warwick , Who spake aloud , What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence And so he vanished . Then came wand ring by A shadow like an angel , with bright hair Dabbled in blood , and he shrieked out aloud
Tis strange , my Theseus , that these lovers speak of .
More strange than true . I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys . Lovers and madmen have such seething brains , Such shaping fantasies , that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends . The lunatic , the lover , and the poet Are of imagination all compact . One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman . The lover , all as frantic , Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt . The poet’s eye , in fine frenzy rolling , Doth glance from heaven to Earth , from Earth to heaven . And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown , the poet’s pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name . Such tricks hath strong imagination , That if it would but apprehend some joy , It comprehends some bringer of that joy . Or in the night , imagining some fear , How easy is a bush supposed a bear
But all the story of the night told over , And all their minds transfigured so together , More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy , But , howsoever , strange and admirable .
Come hither , herald . Let the trumpet sound , And read out this .
Sound , trumpet
If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund , supposed Earl of Gloucester , that he is a manifold traitor , let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet . He is bold in his defense .
Sound
Again
That Cassio loves her , I do well believe ’t . That she loves him , ’tis apt and of great credit . The Moor , howbeit that I endure him not , Is of a constant , loving , noble nature , And I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband . Now , I do love her too , Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge , For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leaped into my seat . The thought whereof Doth , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him , wife for wife . Or , failing so , yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure . Which thing to do , If this poor trash of Venice , whom I trace For his quick hunting , stand the putting on , I’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip , Abuse him to the Moor in the right garb Make the Moor thank me , love me , and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness . Tis here , but yet confused . Knavery’s plain face is never seen till used .
Again
Ask him his purposes , why he appears Upon this call o th trumpet .
What are you Your name , your quality , and why you answer This present summons
To speak so indirectly I am loath I would say the truth but to accuse him so , That is your part yet I am advised to do it He says , to veil full purpose .
Be ruled by him .
Besides , he tells me that , if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side , I should not think it strange for ’tis a physic That’s bitter to sweet end .
And let them die that age and sullens have For both hast thou , and both become the grave .
I would Friar Peter
O , peace the friar is come .
I do beseech your majesty , impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him He loves you , on my life , and holds you dear As Harry Duke of Hereford , were he here .
Right , you say true as Hereford’s love , so his As theirs , so mine and all be as it is .
Come , I have found you out a stand most fit , Where you may have such vantage on the duke , He shall not pass you . Twice have the trumpets sounded The generous and gravest citizens Have hent the gates , and very near upon The duke is entering therefore , hence , away
My liege , old Gaunt commends him to your majesty .
What says he
Nay , nothing all is said His tongue is now a stringless instrument Words , life and all , old Lancaster hath spent .
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so Though death be poor , it ends a mortal woe .
The ripest fruit first falls , and so doth he His time is spent , our pilgrimage must be . So much for that . Now for our Irish wars We must supplant those rough rug headed kerns , Which live like venom where no venom else But only they have privilege to live . And for these great affairs do ask some charge , Towards our assistance we do seize to us The plate , corn , revenues and moveables , Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess’d .
Jailer , look to him . Tell not me of mercy . This is the fool that lent out money gratis . Jailer , look to him .
Clarence is come false , fleeting , perjured Clarence , That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury . Seize on him , furies . Take him unto torment . With that , methoughts , a legion of foul fiends Environed me and howlèd in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling waked , and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell , Such terrible impression made my dream .
No marvel , lord , though it affrighted you . I am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .
It is Othello’s pleasure , our noble and valiant general , that , upon certain tidings now arrived , importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet , every man put himself into triumph some to dance , some to make bonfires , each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him . For besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial . So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed . All offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven . Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go I toward Aragon .
I’ll bring you thither , my lord , if you’ll vouchsafe me .
Nay , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it . I will only be bold with Benedick for his company , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth . He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bow string , and the little hangman dare not shoot at him . He hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
Gallants , I am not as I have been .
Here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . Joy , gentle friends Joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts
So say I . Methinks you are sadder .
I hope he be in love .
More than to us Wait in your royal walks , your board , your bed
Hear me yet , good Shylock .
I’ll have my bond . Speak not against my bond . I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond . Thou calledst me dog before thou hadst a cause . But since I am a dog , beware my fangs . The duke shall grant me justice . I do wonder , Thou naughty jailer , that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request .
I pray thee , hear me speak .
I’ll have my bond . I will not hear thee speak . I’ll have my bond , and therefore speak no more . I’ll not be made a soft and dull eyed fool To shake the head , relent and sigh , and yield To Christian intercessors . Follow not . I’ll have no speaking . I will have my bond .
O , know , my name is lost . By treason’s tooth bare gnawn and canker bit . Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal .
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men .
Ah keeper , keeper , I have done those things , That now give evidence against my soul , For Edward’s sake , and see how he requites me . O God , if my deep prayers cannot appease thee , But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , Yet execute thy wrath in me alone O , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children Keeper , I prithee sit by me awhile . My soul is heavy , and I fain would sleep .
I will , my lord . God give your Grace good rest .
Hang him , truant There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love . If he be sad , he wants money .
Which is that adversary
What’s he that speaks for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester
Himself . What sayst thou to him
Draw thy sword , That if my speech offend a noble heart Thy arm may do thee justice . Here is mine . Behold it is the privilege of mine honors , My oath , and my profession . I protest Maugre thy strength , youth , place , and eminence , Despite thy victor sword and fire new fortune , Thy valor and thy heart thou art a traitor , False to thy gods , thy brother , and thy father , Conspirant gainst this high illustrious prince , And from th extremest upward of thy head To the descent and dust below thy foot A most toad spotted traitor . Say thou No , This sword , this arm , and my best spirits are bent To prove upon thy heart , whereto I speak , Thou liest .
In wisdom I should ask thy name . But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike , And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes , What safe and nicely I might well delay By rule of knighthood , I disdain and spurn . Back do I toss these treasons to thy head , With the hell hated lie o erwhelm thy heart
I have the toothache .
Draw it .
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , Makes the night morning , and the noontide night . Princes have but their titles for their glories , An outward honor for an inward toil ,
Hang it
You must hang it first , and draw it afterwards .
Come now , what masques , what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after supper and bedtime Where is our usual manager of mirth What revels are in hand Is there no play , To ease the anguish of a torturing hour Call Philostrate .
Here , mighty Theseus .
Say , what abridgement have you for this evening What masque , what music How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight
There is a brief , how many sports are ripe . Make choice of which your highness will see first .
The battle with the Centaurs , to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp . We’ll none of that . That have I told my love , In glory of my kinsman Hercules . The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals , Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage . That is an old device , and it was played When I from Thebes came last a conqueror .
My very worthy cousin , fairly met Our old and faithful friend , we are glad to see you .
Happy return be to your royal grace
Many and hearty thankings to you both . We have made inquiry of you and we hear Such goodness of your justice , that our soul Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks , Forerunning more requital .
You make my bonds still greater .
O , your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it , To lock it in the wards of covert bosom , When it deserves , with characters of brass , A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time And razure of oblivion . Give me your hand , And let the subject see , to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favours that keep within . Come , Escalus , You must walk by us on our other hand And good supporters are you .
Now is your time speak loud and kneel before him .
How long shall I be patient ah , how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong Not Gloucester’s death , nor Hereford’s banishment . Not Gaunt’s rebukes , nor England’s private wrongs , Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage , nor my own disgrace , Have ever made me sour my patient cheek , Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face . I am the last of noble Edward’s sons , Of whom thy father , Prince of Wales , was first In war was never lion raged more fierce , In peace was never gentle lamb more mild , Than was that young and princely gentleman . His face thou hast , for even so look’d he , Accomplish’d with the number of thy hours But when he frown’d , it was against the French And not against his friends his noble hand Did will what he did spend and spent not that Which his triumphant father’s hand had won His hands were guilty of no kindred blood , But bloody with the enemies of his kin . O Richard York is too far gone with grief , Or else he never would compare between .
And , for unfelt imaginations , They often feel a world of restless cares , So that betwixt their titles and low name There’s nothing differs but the outward fame .
Ho , who’s here
What wouldst thou , fellow And how cam’st thou hither
I would speak with Clarence , and I came hither on my legs .
What , so brief
Tis better , sir , to be brief than tedious . Let him see our commission , and talk no more .
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands . I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless from the meaning . There lies the duke asleep , and there the keys . He hands them the keys I’ll to the king and signify to him That thus I have resigned my charge to you .
You may , sir . Tis a point of wisdom . Fare you well .
Good Michael , look you to the guard tonight . Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop Not to outsport discretion .
Iago hath direction what to do , But notwithstanding with my personal eye Will I look to ’t .
Iago is most honest . Michael , good night . Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you . Come , my dear love , The purchase made , the fruits are to ensue That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you . Good night .
Welcome , Iago . We must to the watch .
Not this hour , lieutenant , ’tis not yet ten o the clock . Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame . He hath not yet made wanton the night with her , and she is sport for Jove .
She’s a most exquisite lady .
And , I’ll warrant her , full of game .
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of learning , late deceased in beggary . That is some satire , keen and critical , Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe . Very tragical mirth . Merry and tragical Tedious and brief That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . How shall we find the concord of this discord
A play there is , my lord , some ten words long , Which is as brief as I have known a play . But by ten words , my lord , it is too long , Which makes it tedious . For in all the play There is not one word apt , one player fitted . And tragical , my noble lord , it is . For Pyramus therein doth kill himself . Which , when I saw rehearsed , I must confess , Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed .
What are they that do play it
Hard handed men that work in Athens here , Which never labored in their minds till now , And now have toiled their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial .
And we will hear it .
No , my noble lord . It is not for you . I have heard it over , And it is nothing , nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents , Extremely stretched and conned with cru l pain To do you service .
Justice , O royal duke Vail your regard Upon a wrong’d , I would fain have said , a maid O worthy prince , dishonour not your eye By throwing it on any other object Till you have heard me in my true complaint And given me justice , justice , justice , justice
Relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief . Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice Reveal yourself to him .
O worthy duke , You bid me seek redemption of the devil Hear me yourself for that which I must speak Must either punish me , not being believed , Or wring redress from you . Hear me , O hear me , here
My lord , her wits , I fear me , are not firm She hath been a suitor to me for her brother Cut off by course of justice ,
By course of justice
And she will speak most bitterly and strange .
Most strange , but yet most truly , will I speak That Angelo’s forsworn is it not strange That Angelo’s a murderer is ’t not strange That Angelo is an adulterous thief , An hypocrite , a virgin violator Is it not strange and strange
What , shall I stab him as he sleeps
No . He’ll say ’twas done cowardly , when he wakes .
Why , he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day .
Why , then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping .
The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me .
What , art thou afraid
Not to kill him , having a warrant , but to be damned for killing him , from the which no warrant can defend me .
I thought thou hadst been resolute .
So I am to let him live .
I’ll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
Nay , I prithee stay a little . I hope this passionate humor of mine will change . It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty .
How dost thou feel thyself now
Which , for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise , This sword of mine shall give them instant way , Where they shall rest for ever . Trumpets , speak
Faith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature .
What an eye she has Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation .
An inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
And when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love
She is indeed perfection .
Well , happiness to their sheets Come , lieutenant , I have a stoup of wine , and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello .
Not tonight , good Iago . I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking . I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
Oh , they are our friends . But one cup . I’ll drink for you .
I have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold what innovation it makes here . I am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more .
What , man , ’tis a night of revels The gallants desire it .
Where are they
Here at the door . I pray you call them in .
I’ll do ’t , but it dislikes me .
Save him , save him
This is practice , Gloucester . By th law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite . Thou art not vanquished , But cozened and beguiled .
Shut your mouth , dame , Or with this paper shall I stop it . Hold , sir , Nay , no tearing , lady . I perceive you know it .
Say , if I do The laws are mine , not thine . Who can arraign me for ’t
Most monstrous , oh Know’st thou this paper
Ask me not what I know .
Go after her . She’s desperate . Govern her .
Let him alone . I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers . He seeks my life . His reason well I know . I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me . Therefore he hates me .
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
The duke cannot deny the course of law . For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice , if it be denied , Will much impeach the justice of his state , Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations . Therefore go . These griefs and losses have so bated me , That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor . Well , jailer , on . Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt , and then I care not .
Why , uncle , what’s the matter
O my liege , Pardon me , if you please if not , I , pleased Not to be pardon’d , am content withal . Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banish’d Hereford Is not Gaunt dead , and doth not Hereford live Was not Gaunt just , and is not Harry true Did not the one deserve to have an heir Is not his heir a well deserving son Take Hereford’s rights away , and take from Time His charters and his customary rights Let not to morrow then ensue to day Be not thyself for how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession Now , afore God God forbid I say true If you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s rights , Call in the letters patent that he hath By his attorneys general to sue His livery , and deny his offer’d homage , You pluck a thousand dangers on your head , You lose a thousand well disposed hearts And prick my tender patience , to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance cannot think .
I will hear that play . For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it . Go , bring them in . And take your places , ladies .
I love not to see wretchedness o er charged And duty in his service perishing .
Why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
He says they can do nothing in this kind .
The kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . Our sport shall be to take what they mistake . And what poor duty cannot do , noble respect Takes it in might , not merit . Where I have come , great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes , Where I have seen them shiver and look pale , Make periods in the midst of sentences , Throttle their practiced accent in their fears , And in conclusion dumbly have broke off , Not paying me a welcome . Trust me , sweet , Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome , And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence . Love , therefore , and tongue tied simplicity In least speak most , to my capacity .
What , sigh for the toothache
Where is but a humor or a worm .
Well , everyone can master a grief but he that has it .
Yet say I , he is in love .
Nay , it is ten times strange .
There is no appearance of fancy in him , unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises , as to be a Dutchman today , a Frenchman tomorrow , or in the shape of two countries at once , as a German from the waist downward , all slops , and a Spaniard from the hip upward , no doublet . Unless he have a fancy to this foolery , as it appears he hath , he is no fool for fancy , as you would have it appear he is .
It is not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange Nay , it is ten times true for truth is truth To the end of reckoning .
Away with her Poor soul , She speaks this in the infirmity of sense .
If he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs . He brushes his hat o mornings . What should that bode
Hath any man seen him at the barber’s
O prince , I conjure thee , as thou believest There is another comfort than this world , That thou neglect me not , with that opinion That I am touch’d with madness Make not impossible That which but seems unlike ’tis not impossible But one , the wicked’st caitiff on the ground , May seem as shy , as grave , as just , as absolute As Angelo even so may Angelo , In all his dressings , characts , titles , forms , Be an arch villain believe it , royal prince If he be less , he’s nothing but he’s more , Had I more name for badness .
No , but the barber’s man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .
By mine honesty , If she be mad , as I believe no other , Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense , Such a dependency of thing on thing , As e’er I heard in madness .
Remember our reward when the deed’s done .
Zounds , he dies I had forgot the reward .
Indeed , he looks younger than he did , by the loss of a beard .
Nay , he rubs himself with civet . Can you smell him out by that
Where’s thy conscience now
O , in the duke of Gloucester’s purse .
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out .
Tis no matter . Let it go . There’s few or none will entertain it .
What if it come to thee again
If I can fasten but one cup upon him , With that which he hath drunk tonight already , He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress dog . Now my sick fool Roderigo , Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out , To Desdemona hath tonight caroused Potations pottle deep , and he’s to watch . Three lads of Cyprus , noble swelling spirits Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups , And they watch too . Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle . But here they come . If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
I’ll not meddle with it . It makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbor’s wife but it detects him . Tis a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom . It fills a man full of obstacles . It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found . It beggars any man that keeps it . It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing , and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it .
Zounds , ’tis even now at my elbow , persuading me not to kill the duke .
Take the devil in thy mind , and believe him not . He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh .
I am strong framed . He cannot prevail with me .
So please your grace , the Prologue is addressed .
Let him approach .
If we offend , it is with our good will . That you should think we come not to offend , But with good will . To show our simple skill , That is the true beginning of our end . Consider then we come but in despite . We do not come as minding to contest you , Our true intent is . All for your delight We are not here . That you should here repent you , The actors are at hand , and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know .
This fellow doth not stand upon points .
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt . He knows not the stop . A good moral , my lord it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
What you have charged me with , that have I done And more , much more . The time will bring it out . Tis past , and so am I . But what art thou That hast this fortune on me If thou rt noble , I do forgive thee .
Let’s exchange charity . I am no less in blood than thou art , Edmund . If more , the more thou’st wronged me . My name is Edgar , and thy father’s son . The gods are just , and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us . The dark and vicious place where thee he got Cost him his eyes .
Thou’st spoken right . Tis true . The wheel is come full circle . I am here .
Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness . I must embrace thee . Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father .
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound , but not in government .
Worthy prince , I know ’t .
Fore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .
Where have you hid yourself How have you known the miseries of your father
Good faith , a little one , not past a pint , As I am a soldier .
By nursing them , my lord . List a brief tale , And when ’tis told , oh , that my heart would burst The bloody proclamation to escape , That followed me so near O our lives sweetness ,
Some wine , ho And let me the cannikin clink , clink , And let me the cannikin clink . A soldier’s a man , A life’s but a span , Why then let a soldier drink . Some wine , boys
Think what you will , we seize into our hands His plate , his goods , his money and his lands .
I’ll not be by the while my liege , farewell What will ensue hereof , there’s none can tell But by bad courses may be understood That their events can never fall out good .
Go , Bushy , to the Earl of Wiltshire straight Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business . To morrow next We will for Ireland and ’tis time , I trow And we create , in absence of ourself , Our uncle York lord governor of England For he is just and always loved us well . Come on , our queen to morrow must we part Be merry , for our time of stay is short
Well , lords , the Duke of Lancaster is dead .
And living too for now his son is duke .
Barely in title , not in revenue .
Richly in both , if justice had her right .
My heart is great but it must break with silence , Ere’t be disburden’d with a liberal tongue .
Madam , although I speak it in your presence , You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity , which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord . But if you knew to whom you show this honor , How true a gentleman you send relief , How dear a lover of my lord your husband , I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you .
I never did repent for doing good , Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love , There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments , of manners , and of spirit , Which makes me think that this Antonio , Being the bosom lover of my lord , Must needs be like my lord . If it be so , How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty This comes too near the praising of myself . Therefore no more of it . Hear other things . Lorenzo , I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return .
His speech was like a tangled chain . Nothing impaired , but all disordered . Who is next
Gentles , perchance you wonder at this show . But wonder on , till truth make all things plain . This man is Pyramus , if you would know . This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain . This man , with lime and roughcast , doth present Wall , that vile wall which did these lovers sunder . And through Wall’s chink , poor souls , they are content To whisper . At the which let no man wonder . This man , with lanthorn , dog , and bush of thorn , Presenteth Moonshine . For , if you will know , By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus tomb there , there to woo . This grisly beast , which Lion hight by name , The trusty Thisbe , coming first by night , Did scare away , or rather did affright . And , as she fled , her mantle she did fall , Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain . Anon comes Pyramus , sweet youth and tall , And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain . Whereat , with blade , with bloody blameful blade , He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast . And Thisbe , tarrying in mulberry shade , His dagger drew , and died . For all the rest , Let Lion , Moonshine , Wall , and lovers twain At large discourse , while here they do remain .
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation . Come , shall we fall to work
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .
O excellent device and make a sop of him .
Soft , he wakes .
Strike
No , we’ll reason with him .
Where art thou , keeper Give me a cup of wine .
You shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
In God’s name , what art thou
A man , as you are .
But not , as I am , royal .
Nor you , as we are , loyal .
Thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .
My voice is now the king’s , my looks mine own .
O gracious duke , Harp not on that , nor do not banish reason For inequality but let your reason serve To make the truth appear where it seems hid , And hide the false seems true .
For mine own part , I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation , Only attended by Nerissa here Until her husband and my lord’s return . There is a monastery two miles off , And there will we abide . I do desire you Not to deny this imposition , The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you .
Madam , with all my heart . I shall obey you in all fair commands .
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself . So fare you well till we shall meet again .
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
I wish your ladyship all heart’s content .
Many that are not mad Have , sure , more lack of reason . What would you say
That’s as much as to say , the sweet youth’s in love .
I am the sister of one Claudio , Condemn’d upon the act of fornication To lose his head condemn’d by Angelo I , in probation of a sisterhood , Was sent to by my brother one Lucio As then the messenger ,
The greatest note of it is his melancholy .
That’s I , an’t like your grace I came to her from Claudio , and desired her To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo For her poor brother’s pardon .
And when was he wont to wash his face
That’s he indeed .
You were not bid to speak .
Yea , or to paint himself For the which I hear what they say of him .
Nay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops
I thank you for your wish , and am well pleased To wish it back on you . Fare you well , Jessica .
No , my good lord Nor wish’d to hold my peace .
Indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him . Conclude , conclude , he is in love .
Now , Balthazar , As I have ever found thee honest true , So let me find thee still . Take this same letter , And use thou all th endeavour of a man In speed to Padua . See thou render this Into my cousin’s hands , Doctor Bellario .
I wish you now , then Pray you , take note of it and when you have A business for yourself , pray heaven you then Be perfect .
Nay , but I know who loves him .
That would I know too . I warrant , one that knows him not .
Yes , and his ill conditions , and , in despite of all , dies for him .
She shall be buried with her face upwards .
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak Your eyes do menace me . Why look you pale Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come
To , to , to
To murder me
Ay , ay .
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it . Wherein , my friends , have I offended you
Offended us you have not , but the king .
I shall be reconciled to him again .
Never , my lord . Therefore prepare to die .
Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent What is my offense Where is the evidence that doth accuse me What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful . I charge you , as you hope to have redemption , By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins , That you depart , and lay no hands on me . The deed you undertake is damnable .
What we will do , we do upon command .
That we the pain of death would hourly die Rather than die at once taught me to shift Into a madman’s rags , t assume a semblance That very dogs disdained . And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings , Their precious stones new lost , became his guide , Led him , begged for him , saved him from despair . Never O fault revealed myself unto him Until some half hour past , when I was armed . Not sure , though hoping of this good success , I asked his blessing , and from first to last Told him my pilgrimage . But his flawed heart Alack , too weak the conflict to support Twixt two extremes of passion , joy and grief , Burst smilingly .
This speech of yours hath moved me , And shall perchance do good . But speak you on . You look as you had something more to say .
If there be more , more woeful , hold it in . For I am almost ready to dissolve , Hearing of this .
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow , but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity . Whilst I was big in clamor came there in a man Who , having seen me in my worst estate , Shunned my abhorred society , but then , finding Who ’twas that so endured , with his strong arms He fastened on my neck , and bellowed out As he’d burst heaven , threw him on my father , Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him That ever ear received which in recounting
Fore heaven , an excellent song .
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting . Your Dane , your German , and your swag bellied Hollander Drink , ho are nothing to your English .
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
Why , he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain . He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled .
To the health of our general
I am for it , lieutenant , and I’ll do you justice .
Oh , sweet England King Stephen was a worthy peer , His breeches cost him but a crown , He held them sixpence all too dear , With that he called the tailor lown . He was a wight of high renown , And thou art but of low degree , Tis pride that pulls the country down , Then take thine auld cloak about thee . Some wine , ho
Why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .
Will you hear ’t again
No , for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things . Well , heaven’s above all , and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .
It’s true , good lieutenant .
I wonder if the lion be to speak .
No wonder , my lord . One lion may when many asses do .
In this same interlude it doth befall That I , one Snout by name , present a wall . And such a wall , as I would have you think , That had in it a crannied hole , or chink , Through which the lovers , Pyramus and Thisbe , Did whisper often very secretly . This loam , this roughcast , and this stone doth show That I am that same wall . The truth is so . And this the cranny is , right and sinister , Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper .
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee , Bring them , I pray thee , with imagined speed Unto the traject , to the common ferry Which trades to Venice . Waste no time in words , But get thee gone . I shall be there before thee .
Madam , I go with all convenient speed .
Come on , Nerissa , I have work in hand That you yet know not of . We’ll see our husbands Before they think of us .
Shall they see us
They shall , Nerissa , but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplishèd With that we lack . I’ll hold thee any wager , When we are both accoutred like young men , I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two , And wear my dagger with the braver grace , And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice , and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride , and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth , and tell quaint lies , How honorable ladies sought my love , Which I denying , they fell sick and died I could not do withal Then I’ll repent And wish for all that , that I had not killed them . And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell , That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth . I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice .
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse , my lord .
Pyramus draws near the wall . Silence
O grim looked night O night with hue so black O night , which ever art when day is not O night , O night Alack , alack , alack ,
And he that hath commanded is our king .
Erroneous vassals , the great King of kings Hath in the tables of His law commanded That thou shalt do no murder . Will thou then Spurn at His edict and fulfill a man’s Take heed , for He holds vengeance in His hand To hurl upon their heads that break His law .
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too . Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of Lancaster .
And , like a traitor to the name of God , Didst break that vow , and with thy treacherous blade Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son .
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend .
How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree
Alas For whose sake did I that ill deed For Edward , for my brother , for his sake . He sends you not to murder me for this , For in that sin he is as deep as I . If God will be avengèd for this deed , O , know you yet He doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him .
Nay , speak thy mind and let him ne’er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harm
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford If it be so , out with it boldly , man Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him .
No good at all that I can do for him Unless you call it good to pity him , Bereft and gelded of his patrimony .
Now , afore God , ’tis shame such wrongs are borne In him , a royal prince , and many moe Of noble blood in this declining land . The king is not himself , but basely led By flatterers and what they will inform , Merely in hate , ’gainst any of us all , That will the king severely prosecute ’Gainst us , our lives , our children , and our heirs .
The commons hath he pill’d with grievous taxes , And quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined For ancient quarrels , and quite lost their hearts .
And daily new exactions are devised , As blanks , benevolences , and I wot not what But what , o’ God’s name , doth become of this
Wars have not wasted it , for warr’d he hath not , But basely yielded upon compromise That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows More hath he spent in peace than they in wars .
I warrant your honour .
For mine own part , no offence to the general nor any man of quality , I hope to be saved .
Yet is this no charm for the toothache . Old Signior , walk aside with me . I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you , which these hobbyhorses must not hear .
For my life , to break with him about Beatrice
Tis even so . Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice , and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet .
My lord and brother , God save you .
Good e en , brother .
If your leisure served , I would speak with you .
In private
If it please you . Yet Count Claudio may hear , for what I would speak of concerns him .
What’s the matter
Means your lordship to be married tomorrow
You know he does .
I know not that , when he knows what I know .
The warrants for yourself take heed to’t .
And so do I too , lieutenant .
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale ,
Ay , but not before me . The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient . Let’s have no more of this , let’s to our affairs . Forgive us our sins Gentlemen , let’s look to our business . Do not think , gentlemen , I am drunk . This is my ancient , this is my right hand , and this is my left . I am not drunk now . I can stand well enough , and I speak well enough .
Right .
Excellent well
It may be right but you are i’ the wrong To speak before your time . Proceed .
Why , very well then . You must not think then that I am drunk .
To th platform , masters . Come , let’s set the watch .
I went To this pernicious caitiff deputy ,
That’s somewhat madly spoken .
Pardon it The phrase is to the matter .
Mended again . The matter proceed .
In brief , to set the needless process by , How I persuaded , how I pray’d , and kneel’d , How he refell’d me , and how I replied , For this was of much length , the vile conclusion I now begin with grief and shame to utter He would not , but by gift of my chaste body To his concupiscible intemperate lust , Release my brother and , after much debatement , My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour , And I did yield to him but the next morn betimes , His purpose surfeiting , he sends a warrant For my poor brother’s head .
You see this fellow that is gone before , He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar And give direction . And do but see his vice , Tis to his virtue a just equinox , The one as long as th other . Tis pity of him . I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island .
But is he often thus
I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot And thou , O Wall , O sweet , O lovely Wall , That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine . Thou Wall , O Wall , O sweet and lovely Wall , Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
Thanks , courteous Wall . Jove shield thee well for this But what see I No Thisbe do I see . O wicked Wall through whom I see no bliss Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
The wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
No , in truth , sir , he should not . Deceiving me is Thisbe’s cue . She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall . You shall see , it will fall pat as I told you . Yonder she comes .
O Wall , full often hast thou heard my moans , For parting my fair Pyramus and me My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones , Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee .
I see a voice . Now will I to the chink , To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face . Thisbe
Why , shall we turn to men
Fie , what a question’s that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter But come , I’ll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach , which stays for us At the park gate . And therefore haste away , For we must measure twenty miles today .
My love thou art , my love , I think .
Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallant springing , brave Plantagenet , That princely novice , was struck dead by thee
My brother’s love , the devil , and my rage .
Thy brother’s love , our duty , and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee .
If you do love my brother , hate not me . I am his brother , and I love him well . If you are hired for meed , go back again , And I will send you to my brother Gloucester , Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death .
You are deceived . Your brother Gloucester hates you .
O , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear . Go you to him from me .
Ay , so we will .
Tell him , when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , He little thought of this divided friendship . Bid Gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
Ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep .
O , do not slander him , for he is kind .
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm .
The king’s grown bankrupt , like a broken man .
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him .
He hath not money for these Irish wars , His burthenous taxations notwithstanding , But by the robbing of the banish’d duke .
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep . He’ll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle .
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life Began to crack . Twice then the trumpets sounded , And there I left him tranced .
His noble kinsman most degenerate king But , lords , we hear this fearful tempest sing , Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm We see the wind sit sore upon our sails , And yet we strike not , but securely perish .
But who was this
It were well The general were put in mind of it . Perhaps he sees it not , or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils . Is not this true
Kent , sir , the banished Kent , who in disguise Followed his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave .
We see the very wreck that we must suffer And unavoided is the danger now , For suffering so the causes of our wreck .
Not so even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort is .
Nay , let us share thy thoughts , as thou dost ours .
Be confident to speak , Northumberland We three are but thyself and , speaking so , Thy words are but as thoughts therefore , be bold .
Then thus I have from Port le Blanc , a bay In Brittany , received intelligence That Harry Duke of Hereford , Rainold Lord Cobham , That late broke from the Duke of Exeter , His brother , Archbishop late of Canterbury , Sir Thomas Erpingham , Sir John Ramston , Sir John Norbery , Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint , All these well furnish’d by the Duke of Bretagne With eight tall ships , three thousand men of war , Are making hither with all due expedience And shortly mean to touch our northern shore Perhaps they had ere this , but that they stay The first departing of the king for Ireland . If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke , Imp out our drooping country’s broken wing , Redeem from broking pawn the blemish’d crown , Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre’s gilt And make high majesty look like itself , Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh But if you faint , as fearing to do so , Stay and be secret , and myself will go .
How now , Roderigo I pray you , after the lieutenant , go
Help , help , O , help
What kind of help
Speak , man .
What means that bloody knife
Tis hot , it smokes . It came even from the heart of oh , she’s dead
Who dead Speak , man .
Your lady , sir , your lady . And her sister By her is poisoned . She confesses it .
I was contracted to them both . All three Now marry in an instant .
Here comes Kent .
And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity . It were an honest action to say So to the Moor .
Not I , for this fair island . I do love Cassio well , and would do much To cure him of this evil
Yes , truly , for look you , the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children . Therefore I promise ye I fear you . I was always plain with you , and so now I speak my agitation of the matter . Therefore be o good cheer , for truly I think you are damned . There is but one hope in it that can do you any good , and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither .
But , hark What noise
And what hope is that , I pray thee
Marry , you may partly hope that your father got you not , that you are not the Jew’s daughter .
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed . So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother . Thus when I shun Scylla your father , I fall into Charybdis your mother . Well , you are gone both ways .
I shall be saved by my husband . He hath made me a Christian .
This is most likely
O , that it were as like as it is true
By heaven , fond wretch , thou knowist not what thou speak’st , Or else thou art suborn’d against his honour In hateful practise . First , his integrity Stands without blemish . Next , it imports no reason That with such vehemency he should pursue Faults proper to himself if he had so offended , He would have weigh’d thy brother by himself And not have cut him off . Some one hath set you on Confess the truth , and say by whose advice Thou camest here to complain .
And is this all Then , O you blessed ministers above , Keep me in patience , and with ripen’d time Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up In countenance Heaven shield your grace from woe , As I , thus wrong’d , hence unbelieved go
I know you’ld fain be gone . An officer To prison with her Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall On him so near us This needs must be a practise . Who knew of Your intent and coming hither
Think what thou wilt , I am thy lover’s grace . And like Limander am I trusty still .
And I like Helen , till the Fates me kill .
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true .
Truly , the more to blame he . We were Christians eno before , e en as many as could well live one by another . This making Christians will raise the price of hogs . If we grow all to be pork eaters , we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money .
Right , as snow in harvest . Come , you deceive yourself . Tis he that sends us to destroy you here .
It cannot be , for he bewept my fortune , And hugged me in his arms , and swore with sobs That he would labor my delivery .
Why , so he doth , when he delivers you From this earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven .
Make peace with God , for you must die , my lord .
Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God , And art you yet to your own souls so blind That thou will war with God by murd ring me O sirs , consider they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed .
What shall we do
Relent , and save your souls . Which of you if you were a prince’s son Being pent from liberty , as I am now If two such murderers as yourselves came to you , Would not entreat for life Ay , you would beg , Were you in my distress .
Relent No . Tis cowardly and womanish .
As Shafalus to Procrus , I to you .
Oh , kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
I kiss the wall’s hole , not your lips at all .
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway
Tide life , tide death , I come without delay .
Thus have I , Wall , my part dischargèd so . And , being done , thus Wall away doth go .
If there be any impediment , I pray you discover it .
You may think I love you not . Let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that I now will manifest . For my brother , I think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .
One that I would were here , Friar Lodowick .
Why , what’s the matter
A ghostly father , belike . Who knows that Lodowick
I came hither to tell you and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a talking of , the lady is disloyal .
My lord , I know him ’tis a meddling friar I do not like the man had he been lay , my lord For certain words he spake against your grace In your retirement , I had swinged him soundly .
Who , Hero
Words against me this is a good friar , belike And to set on this wretched woman here Against our substitute Let this friar be found .
Even she Leonato’s Hero , your Hero , every man’s Hero .
Disloyal
But yesternight , my lord , she and that friar , I saw them at the prison a saucy friar , A very scurvy fellow .
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness . I could say she were worse . Think you of a worse title , and I will fit her to it . Wonder not till further warrant . Go but with me tonight , you shall see her chamber window entered , even the night before her wedding day . If you love her then , tomorrow wed her . But it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
Blessed be your royal grace I have stood by , my lord , and I have heard Your royal ear abused . First , hath this woman Most wrongfully accused your substitute , Who is as free from touch or soil with her As she from one ungot .
We did believe no less . Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of
May this be so
I will not think it .
I know him for a man divine and holy Not scurvy , nor a temporary meddler , As he’s reported by this gentleman And , on my trust , a man that never yet Did , as he vouches , misreport your grace .
Not to relent is beastly , savage , devilish . My friend , I spy some pity in thy looks . O , if thine eye be not a flatterer , Come thou on my side and entreat for me . A begging prince what beggar pities not
Look behind you , my lord .
Take that , and that . If all this will not do , I’ll drown you in the malmsey butt within .
A bloody deed , and desperately dispatched . How fain , like Pilate , would I wash my hands Of this most grievous murder .
How now What mean’st thou , that thou help’st me not By heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .
I would he knew that I had saved his brother . Take thou the fee , and tell him what I say , For I repent me that the duke is slain .
Now is the mural down between the two neighbors .
No remedy , my lord , when walls are so willful to hear without warning .
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard .
The best in this kind are but shadows , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them .
It must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . Here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
You , ladies , you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor , May now perchance both quake and tremble here , When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar . Then know that I , as Snug the joiner , am A lion fell , nor else no lion’s dam . For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place , ’twere pity on my life .
I’ll tell my husband , Launcelot , what you say . Here he comes .
A very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
I shall grow jealous of you shortly , Launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
A very best at a beast , my lord , that e er I saw .
Nay , you need not fear us , Lorenzo . Launcelot and I are out . He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter , and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth , for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork .
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly . The Moor is with child by you , Launcelot .
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason . But if she be less than an honest woman , she is indeed more than I took her for .
How every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence , and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots . Go in , sirrah . Bid them prepare for dinner .
That is done , sir . They have all stomachs .
Zounds You rogue You rascal
If you dare not trust that you see , confess not that you know . If you will follow me , I will show you enough , and when you have seen more and heard more , proceed accordingly .
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where I should wed , there will I shame her .
What’s the matter , lieutenant
A knave teach me my duty I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her , I will join with thee to disgrace her .
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses . Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .
Beat me
Dost thou prate , rogue
O day untowardly turned
O mischief strangely thwarting
Nay , good lieutenant I pray you , sir , hold your hand .
Let me go , sir , or I’ll knock you o er the mazzard .
O plague right well prevented So will you say when you have seen the sequel .
My lord , most villanously believe it .
Well , he in time may come to clear himself But at this instant he is sick my lord , Of a strange fever . Upon his mere request , Being come to knowledge that there was complaint Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo , came I hither , To speak , as from his mouth , what he doth know Is true and false and what he with his oath And all probation will make up full clear , Whensoever he’s convented . First , for this woman . To justify this worthy nobleman , So vulgarly and personally accused , Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes , Till she herself confess it .
Good friar , let’s hear it .
Come , come , you’re drunk .
Drunk
Away , I say , go out , and cry a mutiny .
Nay , good lieutenant Alas , gentlemen Help , ho Lieutenant sir , Montano Help , masters Here’s a goodly watch indeed
Do you not smile at this , Lord Angelo O heaven , the vanity of wretched fools Give us some seats . Come , cousin Angelo In this I’ll be impartial be you judge Of your own cause . Is this the witness , friar First , let her show her face , and after speak .
Produce their bodies , be they alive or dead . This judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble Touches us not with pity .
Oh , is this he The time will not allow the compliment Which very manners urges .
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night . Is he not here
To horse , to horse urge doubts to them that fear .
Great thing of us forgot Speak , Edmund , where’s the king And where’s Cordelia
Hold out my horse , and I will first be there .
Seest thou this object , Kent
Alack , why thus
Yet Edmund was beloved . The one the other poisoned for my sake , And after slew herself .
Even so . Cover their faces .
I pant for life . Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature . Quickly send Be brief in it to th castle , for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia . Nay , send in time
Pardon , my lord I will not show my face Until my husband bid me .
This lion is a very fox , for his valor .
True . And a goose for his discretion .
Not so , my lord . For his valor cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
His discretion , I am sure , cannot carry his valor , for the goose carries not the fox . It is well . Leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present
He should have worn the horns on his head .
He is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference .
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present . Myself the man i th moon do seem to be
This is the greatest error of all the rest . The man should be put into the lanthorn . How is it else the man i th moon
He dares not come there for the candle . For you see , it is already in snuff .
I am aweary of this moon . Would he would change
It appears by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane . But yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must stay the time .
So do not I . Go , coward as thou art . Well , I’ll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial . And when I have my meed , I will away , For this will out , and then I must not stay .
Goodly Lord , what a wit snapper are you Then bid them prepare dinner .
That is done too , sir . Only Cover is the word .
Will you cover then , sir
Not so , sir , neither . I know my duty .
What , are you married
Yet more quarreling with occasion Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee , understand a plain man in his plain meaning . Go to thy fellows , bid them cover the table , serve in the meat , and we will come in to dinner .
No , my lord .
For the table , sir , it shall be served in . For the meat , sir , it shall be covered . For your coming in to dinner , sir , why , let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .
Are you a maid
No , my lord .
A widow , then
O dear discretion , how his words are suited The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words , and I do know A many fools that stand in better place , Garnished like him , that for a tricksy word Defy the matter . How cheerest thou , Jessica And now , good sweet , say thy opinion . How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife
Neither , my lord .
Why , you are nothing then neither maid , widow , nor wife
My lord , she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid , widow , nor wife .
Silence that fellow I would he had some cause To prattle for himself .
Well , my lord .
My lord I do confess I ne’er was married And I confess besides I am no maid I have known my husband yet my husband Knows not that ever he knew me .
He was drunk then , my lord it can be no better .
For the benefit of silence , would thou wert so too
Well , my lord .
This is no witness for Lord Angelo .
Madam , your majesty is too much sad You promised , when you parted with the king , To lay aside life harming heaviness And entertain a cheerful disposition .
Now I come to’t my lord She that accuses him of fornication , In self same manner doth accuse my husband , And charges him my lord , with such a time When I’ll depose I had him in mine arms With all the effect of love .
Run , run , O , run
To please the king I did to please myself I cannot do it yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief , Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard yet again , methinks , Some unborn sorrow , ripe in fortune’s womb , Is coming towards me , and my inward soul With nothing trembles at some thing it grieves , More than with parting from my lord the king .
Who’s that which rings the bell Diablo , ho The town will rise . Fie , Fie , lieutenant , You’ll be ashamed for ever .
What is the matter here
I bleed still , I am hurt to the death . He dies
Hold , for your lives
Hold , ho Lieutenant sir , Montano gentlemen , Have you forgot all place of sense and duty Hold The general speaks to you . Hold , for shame
Why , how now , ho From whence ariseth this Are we turned Turks And to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites For Christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl . He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light , he dies upon his motion . Silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle From her propriety . What is the matter , masters Honest Iago , that looks dead with grieving , Speak , who began this On thy love , I charge thee .
I do not know . Friends all but now , even now , In quarter , and in terms like bride and groom Divesting them for bed . And then , but now , As if some planet had unwitted men ,
Are you good men and true
Yea , or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation , body and soul .
To who , my lord Who hath the office Send Thy token of reprieve .
Well thought on . Take my sword . The captain Give it the captain .
Haste thee for thy life .
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair , That she fordid herself .
The gods defend her hear him hence awhile .
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows , Which shows like grief itself , but is not so For sorrow’s eye , glazed with blinding tears , Divides one thing entire to many objects Like perspectives , which rightly gazed upon Show nothing but confusion , eyed awry Distinguish form so your sweet majesty , Looking awry upon your lord’s departure , Find shapes of grief , more than himself , to wail Which , look’d on as it is , is nought but shadows Of what it is not . Then , thrice gracious queen , More than your lord’s departure weep not more’s not seen Or if it be , ’tis with false sorrow’s eye , Which for things true weeps things imaginary .
Howl , howl , howl , howl Oh , you are men of stones . Had I your tongues and eyes , I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack . She’s gone forever . I know when one is dead and when one lives . She’s dead as earth . Lend me a looking glass . If that her breath will mist or stain the stone , Why then , she lives .
Is this the promised end
Or image of that horror
Nay , that were a punishment too good for them , if they should have any allegiance in them , being chosen for the Prince’s watch .
Well , give them their charge , neighbor Dogberry .
First , who think you the most desartless man to be constable
Hugh Otecake , sir , or George Seacole , for they can write and read .
Come hither , neighbor Seacole . God hath blessed you with a good name . To be a well favored man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read comes by nature .
Both which , Master Constable
You have . I knew it would be your answer . Well , for your favor , sir , why , give God thanks , and make no boast of it , and for your writing and reading , let that appear when there is no need of such vanity . You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern . This is your charge
Proceed , Moon .
Why , so . Now have I done a good day’s work . You peers , continue this united league . I every day expect an embassage From my Redeemer to redeem me hence , And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven Since I have made my friends at peace on earth Rivers and Hastings , take each other’s hand . Dissemble not your hatred . Swear your love .
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I , the man in the moon this thornbush , my thornbush and this dog , my dog .
By heaven , my soul is purged from grudging hate , And with my hand I seal my true heart’s love .
Why , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon . But silence Here comes Thisbe .
So thrive I as I truly swear the like .
Take heed you dally not before your king , Lest He that is the supreme King of kings Confound your hidden falsehood , and award Either of you to be the other’s end .
This is old Ninny’s tomb . Where is my love
So prosper I as I swear perfect love .
Oh
And I as I love Hastings with my heart .
Well roared , Lion
Well run , Thisbe
Well shone , Moon Truly , the moon shines with a good grace .
Well moused , Lion
Charges she more than me
Not that I know .
No you say your husband .
Why , just , my lord , and that is Angelo , Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body , But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel’s .
This is a strange abuse . Let’s see thy face .
My husband bids me now I will unmask .
This is that face , thou cruel Angelo , Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on This is the hand which , with a vow’d contract , Was fast belock’d in thine this is the body That took away the match from Isabel , And did supply thee at thy garden house In her imagined person .
Know you this woman
Carnally , she says .
Sirrah , no more
Enough , my lord .
My lord , I must confess I know this woman And five years since there was some speech of marriage Betwixt myself and her which was broke off , Partly for that her promised proportions Came short of composition , but in chief For that her reputation was disvalued In levity since which time of five years I never spake with her , saw her , nor heard from her , Upon my faith and honour .
It may be so but yet my inward soul Persuades me it is otherwise howe’er it be , I cannot but be sad so heavy sad As , though on thinking on no thought I think , Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink .
’Tis nothing but conceit , my gracious lady .
’Tis nothing le conceit is still derived From some forefather grief mine is not so , For nothing had begot my something grief Or something hath the nothing that I grieve ’Tis in reversion that I do possess But what it is , that is not yet known what I cannot name ‘tis nameless woe , I wot .
you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand , in the Prince’s name .
How if he will not stand
Why , then , take no note of him , but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave .
If he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the Prince’s subjects .
True , and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects . You shall also make no noise in the streets for , for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured .
We will rather sleep than talk . We know what belongs to a watch .
Why , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for I cannot see how sleeping should offend . Only have a care that your bills be not stolen . Well , you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed .
God save your majesty and well met , gentlemen I hope the king is not yet shipp’d for Ireland .
How if they will not
Why , then , let them alone till they are sober . If they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .
Well , sir .
Why hopest thou so ’tis better hope he is For his designs crave haste , his haste good hope Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp’d
That he , our hope , might have retired his power , And driven into despair an enemy’s hope , Who strongly hath set footing in this land The banish’d Bolingbroke repeals himself , And with uplifted arms is safe arrived At Ravenspurgh .
Madam , yourself is not exempt in this , Nor you , son Dorset , Buckingham , nor you . You have been factious one against the other . Wife , love Lord Hastings . Let him kiss your hand , And what you do , do it unfeignedly .
There , Hastings , I will never more remember Our former hatred , so thrive I and mine .
Dorset , embrace him . Hastings , love Lord Marquess .
This interchange of love , I here protest , Upon my part shall be inviolable .
And so swear I .
Now , princely Buckingham , seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife’s allies And make me happy in your unity .
And then came Pyramus .
And so the lion vanished .
Sweet Moon , I thank thee for thy sunny beams . I thank thee , Moon , for shining now so bright . For by thy gracious , golden , glittering gleams , I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight . But stay , O spite But mark , poor knight , What dreadful dole is here Eyes , do you see How can it be O dainty duck O dear Thy mantle good , What , stained with blood Approach , ye Furies fell O Fates , come , come , Cut thread and thrum . Quail , crush , conclude , and quell
This passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad .
Beshrew my heart , but I pity the man .
O wherefore , Nature , didst thou lions frame Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear , Which is no , no which was the fairest dame That lived , that loved , that liked , that looked with cheer . Come , tears , confound Out , sword , and wound The pap of Pyramus
Noble prince , As there comes light from heaven and words from breath , As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue , I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly As words could make up vows and , my good lord , But Tuesday night last gone in’s garden house He knew me as a wife . As this is true , Let me in safety raise me from my knees Or else for ever be confixed here , A marble monument
I did but smile till now Now , good my lord , give me the scope of justice . My patience here is touch’d . I do perceive These poor informal women are no more But instruments of some more mightier member That sets them on let me have way , my lord , To find this practise out .
Ay , with my heart And punish them to your height of pleasure . Thou foolish friar , and thou pernicious woman , Compact with her that’s gone , think’st thou thy oaths , Though they would swear down each particular saint , Were testimonies against his worth and credit That’s seal’d in approbation You , Lord Escalus , Sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains To find out this abuse , whence ’tis derived . There is another friar that set them on Let him be sent for .
Past all expressing . It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life , For having such a blessing in his lady , He finds the joys of heaven here on earth . And if on earth he do not merit it , In reason he should never come to heaven . Why , if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women , And Portia one , there must be something else Pawned with the other , for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow .
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife .
Nay , but ask my opinion too of that
I will anon . First let us go to dinner .
Nay , let me praise you while I have a stomach .
No , pray thee , let it serve for table talk . Then howsome er thou speak’st ’mong other things I shall digest it .
Well , I’ll set you forth .
Swords out , and tilting one at other’s breasts In opposition bloody . I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds , And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it .
How comes it , Michael , you are thus forgot
I pray you pardon me , I cannot speak .
Worthy Montano , you were wont be civil . The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted , and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure . What’s the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night brawler Give me answer to it .
Worthy Othello , I am hurt to danger . Your officer Iago can inform you , While I spare speech , which something now offends me , Of all that I do know . Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night , Unless self charity be sometimes a vice , And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us .
Now , by heaven , My blood begins my safer guides to rule , And passion , having my best judgment collied , Assays to lead the way . If I once stir ,
Ay , that left pap Where heart doth hop . Thus die I , thus , thus , thus . Now am I dead . Now am I fled . My soul is in the sky . Tongue , lose thy light . Moon , take thy flight .
Now die , die , die , die , die .
No die , but an ace for him , for he is but one .
Less than an ace , man . For he is dead . He is nothing .
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover
She will find him by starlight . Here she comes , and her passion ends the play .
Fall and cease .
This feather stirs . She lives . If it be so , It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt .
O my good master
Prithee , away .
Tis noble Kent , your friend .
A plague upon you , murderers , traitors all I might have saved her . Now she’s gone for ever . Cordelia , Cordelia , stay a little . Ha What is ’t thou say’st Her voice was ever soft , Gentle and low , an excellent thing in woman . I killed the slave that was a hanging thee .
Tis true , my lords , he did .
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus . I hope she will be brief .
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate Upon your Grace , but with all duteous love Doth cherish you and yours , God punish me When I have most need to employ a friend , With hate in those where I expect most love . And most assurèd that he is a friend , Deep , hollow , treacherous , and full of guile Be he unto me this do I beg of God When I am cold in love to you or yours .
A mote will turn the balance , which Pyramus , which Thisbe , is the better . He for a man , God warrant us , she for a woman , God bless us .
A pleasing cordial , princely Buckingham , Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart . There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here To make the blessèd period of this peace .
Did I not , fellow I have seen the day with my good biting falchion I would have made them skip . I am old now , And these same crosses spoil me . Who are you Mine eyes are not o th best , I’ll tell you straight .
And in good time , Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke .
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen , And , princely peers , a happy time of day .
Happy indeed , as we have spent the day . Gloucester , we have done deeds of charity , Made peace of enmity , fair love of hate , Between these swelling , wrong incensèd peers .
If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated , One of them we behold .
This a dull sight . Are you not Kent
The same . Your servant Kent . Where is your servant Caius
If you meet a thief , you may suspect him , by virtue of your office , to be no true man , and for such kind of men , the less you meddle or make with them , why the more is for your honesty .
If we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him
Truly , by your office you may , but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled . The most peaceable way for you , if you do take a thief , is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company .
You have been always called a merciful man , partner .
Truly , I would not hang a dog by my will , much more a man who hath any honesty in him .
If you hear a child cry in the night , you must call to the nurse and bid her still it .
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
Would he were here , my lord for he indeed Hath set the women on to this complaint Your provost knows the place where he abides And he may fetch him .
Go do it instantly .
Why then , depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying , for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baas will never answer a calf when he bleats .
And you , my noble and well warranted cousin , Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth , Do with your injuries as seems you best , In any chastisement I for a while will leave you But stir not you till you have well determined Upon these slanderers .
Now God in heaven forbid
My lord , we’ll do it throughly .
Ah , madam , ’tis too true and that is worse , The Lord Northumberland , his son young Henry Percy , The Lords of Ross , Beaumond , and Willoughby , With all their powerful friends , are fled to him .
Why have you not proclaim’d Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitors
Signior Lucio , did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person
We have whereupon the Earl of Worcester Hath broke his staff , resign’d his stewardship , And all the household servants fled with him To Bolingbroke .
‘Cucullus non facit monachum ’ honest in nothing but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most villanous speeches of the duke .
So , Green , thou art the midwife to my woe , And Bolingbroke my sorrow’s dismal heir Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy , And I , a gasping new deliver’d mother , Have woe to woe , sorrow to sorrow join’d .
Despair not , madam .
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him we shall find this friar a notable fellow .
Who shall hinder me I will despair , and be at enmity With cozening hope he is a flatterer , A parasite , a keeper back of death , Who gently would dissolve the bands of life , Which false hope lingers in extremity .
As any in Vienna , on my word .
Tis very true .
This is the end of the charge . You , constable , are to present the Prince’s own person . If you meet the Prince in the night , you may stay him .
Nay , by r Lady , that I think he cannot .
What , is Antonio here
Ready , so please your grace .
I am sorry for thee . Thou art come to answer A stony adversary , an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity , void and empty From any dram of mercy .
I have heard Your grace hath ta en great pains to qualify His rigorous course . But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach , I do oppose My patience to his fury , and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his .
Go , one , and call the Jew into the court .
He is ready at the door . He comes , my lord .
Or do but lift this arm , the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke . Give me to know How this foul rout began , who set it on , And he that is approved in this offence , Though he had twinned with me , both at a birth , Shall lose me . What , in a town of war Yet wild , the people’s hearts brimful of fear , To manage private and domestic quarrel In night , and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous . Iago , who began ’t
If partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier .
Touch me not so near . I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio . Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him . This it is , general Montano and myself being in speech , There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him . Sir , this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause , Myself the crying fellow did pursue , Lest by his clamor as it so fell out The town might fall in fright . He , swift of foot , Outran my purpose , and I returned then rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath , which till tonight I ne er might say before . When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust , even as again they were When you yourself did part them . More of this matter cannot I report .
He’s a good fellow , I can tell you that . He’ll strike , and quickly too . He’s dead and rotten .
No , my good lord . I am the very man
I’ll see that straight .
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps .
You’re welcome hither .
Nor no man else . All’s cheerless , dark , and deadly . Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , And desperately are dead .
Ay , so I think .
He knows not what he says , and vain it is That we present us to him .
Here comes the Duke of York .
With signs of war about his aged neck O , full of careful business are his looks Uncle , for God’s sake , speak comfortable words .
Should I do so , I should belie my thoughts Comfort’s in heaven and we are on the earth , Where nothing lives but crosses , cares and grief . Your husband , he is gone to save far off , Whilst others come to make him lose at home Here am I left to underprop his land , Who , weak with age , cannot support myself Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made Now shall he try his friends that flatter’d him .
My lord , your son was gone before I came .
He was Why , so go all which way it will The nobles they are fled , the commons they are cold , And will , I fear , revolt on Hereford’s side . Sirrah , get thee to Plashy , to my sister Gloucester Bid her send me presently a thousand pound Hold , take my ring .
Very bootless .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
That’s but a trifle here . You lords and noble friends , know our intent . What comfort to this great decay may come Shall be applied . For us , we will resign During the life of this old majesty To him our absolute power .
My lord , I had forgot to tell your lordship , To day , as I came by , I called there But I shall grieve you to report the rest .
Make room , and let him stand before our face . Shylock , the world thinks , and I think so too , That thou but lead’st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act , and then ’tis thought Thou lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty , And where thou now exacts the penalty Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But touched with human gentleness and love , Forgive a moiety of the principal , Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Eno to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint , From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained To offices of tender courtesy . We all expect a gentle answer , Jew .
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose , And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond . If you deny it , let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom . You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats . I’ll not answer that But say it is my humour . Is it answered What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned What , are you answered yet
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
And thus she means , videlicet
Asleep , my love What , dead , my dove O Pyramus , arise Speak , speak . Quite dumb Dead , dead A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes . These lily lips , This cherry nose , These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone , are gone . Lovers , make moan . His eyes were green as leeks . O Sisters three , Come , come to me With hands as pale as milk . Lay them in gore , Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk . Tongue , not a word . Come , trusty sword . Come , blade , my breast imbrue .
But men are men , the best sometimes forget . Though Cassio did some little wrong to him , As men in rage strike those that wish them best , Yet surely Cassio , I believe , received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass .
I know , Iago , Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter , Making it light to Cassio . Cassio , I love thee But never more be officer of mine .
Look , if my gentle love be not raised up I’ll make thee an example .
What’s the matter , dear
All’s well , sweeting , Come away to bed . Sir , for your hurts Myself will be your surgeon . Lead him off .
Iago , look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted . Come , Desdemona , ’tis the soldiers life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife .
What , are you hurt , lieutenant
Ay , past all surgery .
Marry , heaven forbid
Call that same Isabel here once again I would speak with her .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
A blessèd labor , my most sovereign lord . Amongst this princely heap , if any here By false intelligence , or wrong surmise Hold me a foe , If I unwittingly , or in my rage , Have aught committed that is hardly borne By any in this presence , I desire To reconcile me to his friendly peace . Tis death to me to be at enmity I hate it , and desire all good men’s love . First , madam , I entreat true peace of you , Which I will purchase with my duteous service Of you , my noble cousin Buckingham , If ever any grudge were lodged between us Of you and you , Lord Rivers and of Dorset , That all without desert have frowned on me Of you , Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales of you , Dukes , earls , lords , gentlemen indeed , of all . I do not know that Englishman alive With whom my soul is any jot at odds More than the infant that is born tonight . I thank my God for my humility .
Pray you , my lord , give me leave to question you shall see how I’ll handle her .
Ay , and Wall too .
Not better than he , by her own report .
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter . I would to God all strifes were well compounded . My sovereign lord , I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace .
Say you
Why , madam , have I offered love for this , To be so flouted in this royal presence Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead
Marry , sir , I think , if you handled her privately , she would sooner confe perchance , publicly , she’ll be ashamed .
I will go darkly to work with her .
You do him injury to scorn his corse .
Five shillings to one on ’t , with any man that knows the statutes , he may stay him marry , not without the Prince be willing , for indeed the watch ought to offend no man , and it is an offense to stay a man against his will .
That’s the way for women are light at midnight .
By r lady , I think it be so .
Come on , mistre here’s a gentlewoman denies all that you have said .
Ha , ha , ha Well , masters , good night . An there be any matter of weight chances , call up me . Keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night . Come , neighbor .
My lord , here comes the rascal I spoke of here with the provost .
Well , masters , we hear our charge . Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two , and then all to bed .
In very good time speak not you to him till we call upon you .
One word more , honest neighbors . I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door , for the wedding being there tomorrow , there is a great coil tonight . Adieu , be vigitant , I beseech you .
Mum .
Come , sir did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo they have confessed you did .
’Tis false .
How know you where you are
What Conrade
Peace Stir not .
Conrade , I say
Here , man . I am at thy elbow .
You , to your rights With boot , and such addition as your honors Have more than merited . All friends shall taste The wages of their virtue , and all foes The cup of their deservings . O , see , see
And my poor fool is hanged . No , no , no life Why should a dog , a horse , a rat have life , And thou no breath at all Oh , thou lt come no more , Never , never , never , never , never . Pray you , undo this button . Thank you , sir . Do you see this Look on her . Look , her lips . Look there , look there . O , O , O , O .
He faints My lord , my lord
Break , heart . I prithee , break
Look up , my lord .
Vex not his ghost . O , let him pass . He hates him That would upon the rack of this tough world Stretch him out longer .
Oh , he is gone indeed .
The wonder is he hath endured so long . He but usurped his life .
Bear them from hence . Our present business Is to general woe . Friends of my soul , you twain Rule in this realm , and the gored state sustain .
Some men there are love not a gaping pig , Some that are mad if they behold a cat , And others , when the bagpipe sings i th nose , Cannot contain their urine . For affection , Mistress of passion , sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes . Now , for your answer As there is no firm reason to be rendered Why he cannot abide a gaping pig Why he , a harmless necessary cat Why he , a woollen bagpipe , but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend , himself being offended So can I give no reason , nor I will not , that I follow thus A losing suit against him . Are you answered
This is no answer , thou unfeeling man , To excuse the current of thy cruelty .
I am not bound to please thee with my answers .
Do all men kill the things they do not love
Hates any man the thing he would not kill
Every offense is not a hate at first .
What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
I pray you , think you question with the Jew You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height . You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb .
What is’t , knave
An hour before I came , the duchess died .
God for his mercy what a tide of woes Comes rushing on this woeful land at once I know not what to do I would to God , So my untruth had not provoked him to it , The king had cut off my head with my brother’s . What , are there no posts dispatch’d for Ireland How shall we do for money for these wars Come , sister , cousin , I would say pray , pardon me . Go , fellow , get thee home , provide some carts And bring away the armour that is there .
Gentlemen , will you go muster men If I know how or which way to order these affairs Thus thrust disorderly into my hands , Never believe me . Both are my kinsmen The one is my sovereign , whom both my oath And duty bids defend the other again Is my kinsman , whom the king hath wrong’d , Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right . Well , somewhat we must do . Come , cousin , I’ll Dispose of you . Gentlemen , go , muster up your men , And meet me presently at Berkeley . I should to Plashy too But time will not permit all is uneven , And every thing is left at six and seven .
Who knows not he is dead Who knows he is
Reputation , reputation , reputation Oh , I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is bestial . My reputation , Iago , my reputation
As I am an honest man , I thought you had received some bodily wound . There is more sense in that than in reputation . Reputation is an idle and most false imposition , oft got without merit and lost without deserving . You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser . What , man , there are ways to recover the general again . You are but now cast in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice , even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion . Sue to him again and he’s yours .
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer . Drunk And speak parrot And squabble Swagger Swear And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil
All seeing heaven , what a world is this
Look I so pale , Lord Dorset , as the rest
Ay , my good lord , and no one in the presence But his red color hath forsook his cheeks .
Is Clarence dead The order was reversed .
But he , poor man , by your first order died , And that a wingèd Mercury did bear . Some tardy cripple bear the countermand , That came too lag to see him burièd . God grant that some , less noble and less loyal , Nearer in bloody thoughts , and not in blood , Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did , And yet go current from suspicion .
What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you
I know not .
Is ’t possible
I remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly . A quarrel , but nothing wherefore . Oh , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts
A boon , my sovereign , for my service done .
I prithee , peace . My soul is full of sorrow .
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me .
Then say at once what is it thou requests .
The forfeit , sovereign , of my servant’s life , Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk .
I have a journey , sir , shortly to go . My master calls me . I must not say no .
The weight of this sad time we must obey . Speak what we feel , not what we ought to say . The oldest hath borne most . We that are young Shall never see so much , nor live so long .
Mass , and my elbow itched , I thought there would a scab follow .
I will owe thee an answer for that . And now forward with thy tale .
Stand thee close , then , under this penthouse , for it drizzles rain , and I will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .
Some treason , masters . Yet stand close .
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats .
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich . For when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .
I wonder at it .
That shows thou art unconfirmed . Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet , or a hat , or a cloak , is nothing to a man .
Yes , it is apparel .
I mean the fashion .
Yes , the fashion is the fashion .
No , assure you . The wall is down that parted their fathers . Will it please you to see the epilogue , or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company
No epilogue , I pray you , for your play needs no excuse . Never excuse for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed . Marry , if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe’s garter , it would have been a fine tragedy . And so it is , truly , and very notably discharged . But come , your Bergomask . Let your epilogue alone .
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve . Lovers , to bed . Tis almost fairy time . I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatched . This palpable gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night . Sweet friends , to bed . A fortnight hold we this solemnity , In nightly revels and new jollity .
You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven . You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to soften that than which what’s harder His Jewish heart . Therefore I do beseech you Make no more offers , use no farther means , But with all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment and the Jew his will .
For thy three thousand ducats here is six .
If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts , and every part a ducat , I would not draw them . I would have my bond .
How shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none
Now the hungry lion roars And the wolf behowls the moon , Whilst the heavy ploughman snores , All with weary task fordone . Now the wasted brands do glow , Whilst the screech owl , screeching loud , Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud . Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide , Every one lets forth his sprite , In the churchway paths to glide .
Respect to your great place and let the devil Be sometime honour’d for his burning throne Where is the duke ’tis he should hear me speak .
The duke’s in us and we will hear you speak Look you speak justly .
What judgment shall I dread , doing no wrong You have among you many a purchased slave , Which like your asses and your dogs and mules You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them . Shall I say to you , Let them be free Marry them to your heirs Why sweat they under burdens Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands You will answer , The slaves are ours . So do I answer you . The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought . Tis mine and I will have it . If you deny me , fie upon your law There is no force in the decrees of Venice . I stand for judgment . Answer , shall I have it
Boldly , at least . But , O , poor souls , Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox Good night to your redress Is the duke gone Then is your cause gone too . The duke’s unjust , Thus to retort your manifest appeal , And put your trial in the villain’s mouth Which here you come to accuse .
This is the rascal this is he I spoke of .
Why , thou unreverend and unhallow’d friar , Is’t not enough thou hast suborn’d these women To accuse this worthy man , but , in foul mouth And in the witness of his proper ear , To call him villain and then to glance from him To the duke himself , to tax him with injustice Take him hence to the rack with him We’ll touse you Joint by joint , but we will know his purpose . What ‘unjust’
Be not so hot the duke Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he Dare rack his own his subject am I not , Nor here provincial . My business in this state Made me a looker on here in Vienna , Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble Till it o’er run the stew laws for all faults , But faults so countenanced , that the strong statutes Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop , As much in mock as mark .
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland , But none returns . For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossible .
Besides , our nearness to the king in love Is near the hate of those love not the king .
And that’s the wavering commons for their love Lies in their purses , and whoso empties them By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate .
Wherein the king stands generally condemn’d .
If judgement lie in them , then so do we , Because we ever have been near the king .
Well , I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle The Earl of Wiltshire is already there .
Thither will I with you for little office The hateful commons will perform for us , Except like curs to tear us all to pieces . Will you go along with us
No I will to Ireland to his majesty . Farewell if heart’s presages be not vain , We three here art that ne’er shall meet again .
That’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke .
Two households , both alike in dignity , From ancient grudge break to new mutiny , Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean . From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents strife . The fearful passage of their death marked love And the continuance of their parents rage , Which , but their children’s end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours traffic of our stage The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .
Slander to the state Away with him to prison
What can you vouch against him , Signior Lucio Is this the man that you did tell us of
’Tis he , my lord . Come hither , goodman baldpate do you know me
I remember you , sir , by the sound of your voice I met you at the prison , in the absence of the duke .
O , did you so And do you remember what you said of the duke
Most notedly , sir .
Do you so , sir And was the duke a fleshmonger , a fool , and a coward , as you then reported him to be
Why , but you are now well enough . How came you thus recovered
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath . One unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .
Come , you are too severe a moraler . As the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , I could heartily wish this had not befallen . But since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
I will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me I am a drunkard . Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all . To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast Oh , strange Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
You must , sir , change persons with me , ere you make that my report you , indeed , spoke so of him and much more , much worse .
Come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used . Exclaim no more against it . And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .
I have well approved it , sir . I drunk
O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches
I protest I love the duke as I love myself .
Have I a tongue to doom my brother’s death , And shall the tongue give pardon to a slave My brother killed no man his fault was thought , And yet his punishment was bitter death . Who sued to me for him Who , in my wrath , Kneeled at my feet , and bade me be advised Who spoke of brotherhood Who spoke of love Who told me how the poor soul did forsake The mighty Warwick and did fight for me Who told me , in the field by Tewkesbury , When Oxford had me down , he rescued me , And said Dear brother , live , and be a king Who told me , when we both lay in the field Frozen almost to death , how he did lap me Even in his garments and did give himself , All thin and naked , to the numb cold night All this from my remembrance brutish wrath Sinfully plucked , and not a man of you Had so much grace to put it in my mind . But when your carters or your waiting vassals Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced The precious image of our dear Redeemer , You straight are on your knees for pardon , pardon , And I , unjustly too , must grant it you . Stanley rises But for my brother , not a man would speak , Nor I , ungracious , speak unto myself For him , poor soul . The proudest of you all Have been beholding to him in his life , Yet none of you would once beg for his life . O God , I fear Thy justice will take hold On me and you , and mine and yours for this Come , Hastings , help me to my closet . Ah , poor Clarence .
You or any man living may be drunk at a time , man . I tell you what you shall do . Our general’s wife is now the general . I may say so in this respect , for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation , mark , and denotement of her parts and graces . Confess yourself freely to her , importune her help to put you in your place again . She is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested . This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .
Hark , how the villain would close now , after his treasonable abuses
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal . Away with him to prison Where is the provost Away with him to prison lay bolts enough upon him let him speak no more . Away with those giglots too , and with the other confederate companion
Gregory , on my word , we’ll not carry coals .
No , for then we should be colliers .
I mean , an we be in choler , we’ll draw .
Ay , while you live , draw your neck out of collar .
I strike quickly , being moved .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
And we fairies , that do run By the triple Hecate’s team From the presence of the sun , Following darkness like a dream , Now are frolic . Not a mouse Shall disturb this hallowed house . I am sent with broom before To sweep the dust behind the door .
A dog of the house of Montague moves me .
Upon my power I may dismiss this court , Unless Bellario , a learnèd doctor , Whom I have sent for to determine this , Come here today .
Through the house give glimmering light , By the dead and drowsy fire . Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier . And this ditty , after me , Sing and dance it trippingly .
Tush , I may as well say the fool’s the fool . But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand . Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st away .
My lord , here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor , New come from Padua .
I know that Deformed . He has been a vile thief this seven year . He goes up and down like a gentleman . I remember his name .
First , rehearse your song by rote , To each word a warbling note . Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place .
A dog of that house shall move me to stand . I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s .
Bring us the letter . Call the messenger .
Didst thou not hear somebody
Good cheer , Antonio What , man , courage yet The Jew shall have my flesh , blood , bones and all , Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood .
Now until the break of day , Through this house each fairy stray . To the best bride bed will we , Which by us shall blessèd be . And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate . So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be . And the blots of Nature’s hand Shall not in their issue stand .
I am a tainted wether of the flock , Meetest for death . The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground , and so let me . You cannot better be employed , Bassanio , Than to live still and write mine epitaph .
Came you from Padua , from Bellario
From both , my lord . Bellario greets your grace .
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
This is the fruits of rashness . Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence death O , they did urge it still unto the king . God will revenge it . Come , lords , will you go To comfort Edward with our company
No , ’twas the vane on the house .
We wait upon your Grace .
Seest thou not , I say , what a deformed thief this fashion is , how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five and thirty , sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting , sometime like god Bel’s priests in the old church window , sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm eaten tapestry , where his codpiece seems as massy as his club
All this I see , and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man . But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
Not so , neither . But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret , the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman , by the name of Hero . She leans me out at her mistress chamber window , bids me a thousand times good night . I tell this tale vilely . I should first tell thee how the Prince , Claudio and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .
Alas , poor duke the task he undertakes Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry Where one on his side fights , thousands will fly . Farewell at once , for once , for all , and ever .
Well , we may meet again .
I fear me , never .
Stay , sir stay awhile .
What , resists he Help him , Lucio .
Come , sir come , sir come , sir foh , sir Why , you bald pated , lying rascal , you must be hooded , must you Show your knave’s visage , with a pox to you show your sheep biting face , and be hanged an hour Will’t not off
Thou art the first knave that e’er madest a duke . First , provost , let me bail these gentle three . Sneak not away , sir for the friar and you Must have a word anon . Lay hold on him .
This may prove worse than hanging .
Sir , by your leave . Hast thou or word , or wit , or impudence , That yet can do thee office If thou hast , Rely upon it till my tale be heard , And hold no longer out .
O my dread lord , I should be guiltier than my guiltiness , To think I can be undiscernible , When I perceive your grace , like power divine , Hath look’d upon my passes . Then , good prince , No longer session hold upon my shame , But let my trial be mine own confession Immediate sentence then and sequent death Is all the grace I beg .
That shows thee a weak slave , for the weakest goes to the wall .
Tis true , and therefore women , being the weaker vessels , are ever thrust to the wall . Therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall , and thrust his maids to the wall .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
Tis all one . I will show myself a tyrant . When I have fought with the men , I will be civil with the maids . I will cut off their heads .
The heads of the maids
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads . Take it in what sense thou wilt .
They must take it in sense that feel it .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .
Tis well thou art not fish . If thou hadst , thou hadst been poor john .
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
Draw thy tool Here comes of the house of Montagues .
Not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh Jew , Thou makest thy knife keen . But no metal can No , not the hangman’s axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy . Can no prayers pierce thee
My naked weapon is out . Quarrel I will back thee .
No , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
O , be thou damned , inexecrable dog , And for thy life let justice be accused Thou almost makest me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men . Thy currish spirit Governed a wolf who , hanged for human slaughter , Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet , And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infused itself in thee , for thy desires Are wolvish , bloody , starved , and ravenous .
You advise me well .
I protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
I think it freely , and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me . I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me .
You are in the right . Good night , lieutenant , I must to the watch .
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond , Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud . Repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall To cureless ruin . I stand here for law .
Good night , honest Iago .
This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learnèd doctor to our court . Where is he
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you’ll admit him .
Good grandam , tell us , is our father dead
No , boy .
Why do you weep so oft , and beat your breast , And cry , O Clarence , my unhappy son
And what’s he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest , Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For ’tis most easy Th inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit . She’s framed as fruitful As the free elements . And then for her To win the Moor , were to renounce his baptism , All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin , His soul is so enfettered to her love , That she may make , unmake , do what she list , Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function . How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course , Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now . For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor , I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear
Why do you look on us and shake your head , And call us orphans , wretches , castaways , If that our noble father were alive
My pretty cousins , you mistake me both . I do lament the sickness of the king , As loath to lose him , not your father’s death . It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost .
Then , you conclude , my grandam , he is dead . The king mine uncle is to blame for it . God will revenge it , whom I will importune With earnest prayers , all to that effect .
And so will I .
Peace , children , peace . The king doth love you well . Incapable and shallow innocents , You cannot guess who caused your father’s death .
Come hither , Mariana . Say , wast thou e’er contracted to this woman
I was , my lord .
Go take her hence , and marry her instantly . Do you the office , friar which consummate , Return him here again . Go with him , provost .
My lord , I am more amazed at his dishonour Than at the strangeness of it .
Come hither , Isabel . Your friar is now your prince as I was then Advertising and holy to your business , Not changing heart with habit , I am still Attorney’d at your service .
O , give me pardon , That I , your vassal , have employ’d and pain’d Your unknown sovereignty
You are pardon’d , Isabel And now , dear maid , be you as free to us . Your brother’s death , I know , sits at your heart And you may marvel why I obscured myself , Labouring to save his life , and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power Than let him so be lost . O most kind maid , It was the swift celerity of his death , Which I did think with slower foot came on , That brain’d my purpose . But , peace be with him That life is better life , past fearing death , Than that which lives to fear make it your comfort , So happy is your brother .
Never mole , harelip , nor scar , Nor mark prodigious , such as are Despisèd in nativity , Shall upon their children be . With this field dew consecrate , Every fairy take his gait . And each several chamber bless Through this palace with sweet peace . And the owner of it blessed Ever shall in safety rest . Trip away . Make no stay . Meet me all by break of day .
If we shadows have offended , Think but this , and all is mended That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear . And this weak and idle theme , No more yielding but a dream , Gentles , do not reprehend . If you pardon , we will mend . And , as I am an honest Puck , If we have unearnèd luck Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue , We will make amends ere long . Else the Puck a liar call . So good night unto you all . Give me your hands if we be friends , And Robin shall restore amends .
How far is it , my lord , to Berkeley now
Believe me , noble lord , I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles , and makes them wearisome , And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar , Making the hard way sweet and delectable . But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found In Ross and Willoughby , wanting your company , Which , I protest , hath very much beguiled The tediousness and process of my travel But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoy’d by this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short , as mine hath done By sight of what I have , your noble company .
How Turn thy back and run
Fear me not .
No , marry . I fear thee .
Let us take the law of our sides . Let them begin .
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .
Nay , as they dare . I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir
I do bite my thumb , sir .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir
Of much less value is my company Than your good words . But who comes here
And thought they Margaret was Hero
Is the law of our side if I say ay
Two of them did , the Prince and Claudio , but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths , which first possessed them , partly by the dark night , which did deceive them , but chiefly by my villainy , which did confirm any slander that Don John had made , away went Claudio enraged , swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple , and there , before the whole congregation , shame her with what he saw o ernight and send her home again without a husband .
We charge you , in the Prince’s name , stand
Call up the right Master Constable . We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .
And one Deformed is one of them . I know him he wears a lock .
Masters , masters
You’ll be made bring Deformed forth , I warrant you .
Masters , never speak , we charge you , let us obey you go with us .
No .
With all my heart . Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place . Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter . Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick , but in the instant that your messenger came , in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome . His name is Balthazar . I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant . We turned o er many books together . He is furnished with my opinion , which bettered with his own learning , the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my stead . I beseech you , let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation , for I never knew so young a body with so old a head . I leave him to your gracious acceptance , whose trial shall better publish his commendation .
No , sir . I do not bite my thumb at you , sir , but I bite my thumb , sir .
Do you quarrel , sir
You hear the learned Bellario , what he writes . And here I take it is the doctor come . Give me your hand . Come you from old Bellario
Quarrel , sir No , sir .
I did , my lord .
You are welcome . Take your place . Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court
I am informèd thoroughly of the cause . Which is the merchant here , and which the Jew
That she repeals him for her body’s lust . And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor . So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all .
How now , Roderigo
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts , but one that fills up the cry . My money is almost spent , I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains . And so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to Venice .
How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , And wit depends on dilatory time . Does’t not go well Cassio hath beaten thee . And thou , by that small hurt , hath cashiered Cassio . Though other things grow fair against the sun , Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe . Content thyself awhile . In troth , ’tis morning . Pleasure and action make the hours seem short . Retire thee , go where thou art billeted . Away , I say , thou shalt know more hereafter . Nay , get thee gone .
Grandam , we can , for my good uncle Gloucester Told me the king , provoked to it by the queen , Devised impeachments to imprison him And when my uncle told me so , he wept , And pitied me , and kindly kissed my cheek , Bade me rely on him as on my father , And he would love me dearly as a child .
Ah , that deceit should steal such gentle shape , And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice . He is my son , ay , and therein my shame , Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit .
Think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam
Ay , boy .
I cannot think it . Hark , what noise is this
Ah , who shall hinder me to wail and weep , To chide my fortune and torment myself I’ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy .
What means this scene of rude impatience
To make an act of tragic violence . Edward , my lord , thy son , our king , is dead . Why grow the branches when the root is gone Why wither not the leaves that want their sap
I do , my lord .
For this new married man approaching here , Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong’d Your well defended honour , you must pardon For Mariana’s sake but as he adjudged your brother , Being criminal , in double violation Of sacred chastity and of promise breach Thereon dependent , for your brother’s life , The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible , even from his proper tongue , ‘An Angelo for Claudio , death for death ’ Haste still pays haste , and leisure answers leisure Like doth quit like , and MEASURE still FOR MEASUREMatthew 7 1 2 Judge not , that ye be not judged . . . with what measure you mete , it shall be measured to you again . MEASURE still FOR MEASURE . Then , Angelo , thy fault’s thus manifested Which , though thou wouldst deny , denies thee vantage . We do condemn thee to the very block Where Claudio stoop’d to death , and with like haste . Away with him
O my most gracious lord , I hope you will not mock me with a husband .
It is your husband mock’d you with a husband . Consenting to the safeguard of your honour , I thought your marriage fit else imputation , For that he knew you , might reproach your life And choke your good to come for his possessions , Although by confiscation they are ours , We do instate and widow you withal , To buy you a better husband .
Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress . I’ll set her on . Myself , the while , to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife . Ay , that’s the way . Dull not device by coldness and delay .
I’ll pheeze you , in faith .
A pair of stocks , you rogue
Y are a baggage , the Slys are no rogues . Look in the chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror . Therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide . Sessa
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst
No , not a denier . Go by , Saint Jeronimy . Go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
I know my remedy . I must go fetch the thirdborough .
O my dear lord , I crave no other , nor no better man .
Never crave him we are definitive .
Gentle my liege ,
You do but lose your labour . Away with him to death
Now , sir , to you .
O my good lord Sweet Isabel , take my part Lend me your knees , and all my life to come I’ll lend you all my life to do you service .
Against all sense you do importune her Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact , Her brother’s ghost his paved bed would break , And take her hence in horror .
Isabel , Sweet Isabel , do yet but kneel by me Hold up your hands , say nothing I’ll speak all . They say , best men are moulded out of faults And , for the most , become much more the better For being a little bad so may my husband . O Isabel , will you not lend a knee
Third , or fourth , or fifth borough , I’ll answer him by law . I’ll not budge an inch , boy . Let him come , and kindly .
If you will live , lament . If die , be brief , That our swift wingèd souls may catch the king’s , Or , like obedient subjects , follow him To his new kingdom of ne er changing night .
Ah , so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband . I have bewept a worthy husband’s death And lived with looking on his images But now two mirrors of his princely semblance Are cracked in pieces by malignant death , And I , for comfort , have but one false glass That grieves me when I see my shame in him . Thou art a widow , yet thou art a mother , And hast the comfort of thy children left , But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands , Clarence and Edward . O , what cause have I , Thine being but a moiety of my moan , To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
Ah , aunt , you wept not for our father’s death . How can we aid you with our kindred tears
Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned . Your widow dolor likewise be unwept
Give me no help in lamentation . I am not barren to bring forth complaints . All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes , That I , being governed by the watery moon , May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world . Ah , for my husband , for my dear lord Edward
Masters , play here , I will content your pains . Something that’s brief , and bid Good morrow , general .
Why masters , have your instruments been in Naples , that they speak i th nose thus
How , sir How
Are these , I pray you , wind instruments
Ay , marry , are they , sir .
Oh , thereby hangs a tail .
Whereby hangs a tale , sir
Marry sir , by many a wind instrument that I know . But , masters , here’s money for you , and the general so likes your music that he desires you , for love’s sake , to make no more noise with it .
Well , sir , we will not .
But if you do , sir , I am for you . I serve as good a man as you .
No better .
Well , sir .
Say better . Here comes one of my master’s kinsmen .
Yes , better , sir .
You lie .
Draw , if you be men . Gregory , remember thy washing blow .
Part , fools Put up your swords . You know not what you do .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds Turn thee , Benvolio . Look upon thy death .
Huntsman , I charge thee , tender well my hounds . Breathe Merriman , the poor cur is embossed , And couple Clowder with the deep mouthed brach . Saw’st thou not , boy , how Silver made it good At the hedge corner , in the coldest fault I would not lose the dog for twenty pound .
Why , Belman is as good as he , my lord . He cried upon it at the merest loss , And twice today picked out the dullest scent . Trust me , I take him for the better dog .
Thou art a fool . If Echo were as fleet , I would esteem him worth a dozen such . But sup them well and look unto them all . Tomorrow I intend to hunt again .
I will , my lord .
What’s here One dead , or drunk See , doth he breathe
He breathes , my lord . Were he not warmed with ale , This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly .
O monstrous beast , how like a swine he lies Grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image Sirs , I will practice on this drunken man . What think you if he were conveyed to bed , Wrapped in sweet clothes , rings put upon his fingers , A most delicious banquet by his bed , And brave attendants near him when he wakes , Would not the beggar then forget himself
Antonio and old Shylock , both stand forth .
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name .
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow , Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed . You stand within his danger , do you not
Ay , so he says .
We are like to prove a goodly commodity , being taken up of these men’s bills .
If you have any music that may not be heard , to ’t again . But , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .
Do you confess the bond
I do .
Then must the Jew be merciful .
On what compulsion must I Tell me that .
We have none such , sir .
Then put up your pipes in your bag , for I’ll away . Go , vanish into air , away
The quality of mercy is not strained . It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath . It is twice blessed It blesseth him that gives and him that takes . Tis mightiest in the mightiest . It becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown . His scepter shows the force of temporal power , The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings , But mercy is above this sceptered sway . It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings . It is an attribute to God himself . And earthly power doth then show likest God’s When mercy seasons justice . Therefore , Jew ,
Dost thou hear , my honest friend
No , I hear not your honest friend , I hear you .
Prithee , keep up thy quillets . There’s a poor piece of gold for thee . If the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring , tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech . Wilt thou do this
She is stirring , sir . If she will stir hither , I shall seem to notify unto her .
In happy time , Iago .
You have not been abed , then
Why , no . The day had broke Before we parted . I have made bold , Iago , To send in to your wife . My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access .
He dies for Claudio’s death .
Most bounteous sir , Look , if it please you , on this man condemn’d , As if my brother lived I partly think A due sincerity govern’d his deeds , Till he did look on me since it is so , Let him not die . My brother had but justice , In that he did the thing for which he died For Angelo , His act did not o’ertake his bad intent , And must be buried but as an intent That perish’d by the way thoughts are no subjects Intents but merely thoughts .
Merely , my lord .
A commodity in question , I warrant you . Come , we’ll obey you .
Your suit’s unprofitable stand up , I say . I have bethought me of another fault . Provost , how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour
It was commanded so .
It is my son , young Harry Percy , Sent from my brother Worcester , whencesoever . Harry , how fares your uncle
I had thought , my lord , to have learn’d his health of you .
Why , is he not with the queen
No , my good Lord he hath forsook the court , Broken his staff of office and dispersed The household of the king .
What was his reason He was not so resolved when last we spake together .
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor . But he , my lord , is gone to Ravenspurgh , To offer service to the Duke of Hereford , And sent me over by Berkeley , to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh .
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford , boy
Had you a special warrant for the deed
No , my good lord it was by private message .
For which I do discharge you of your office Give up your keys .
Pardon me , noble lord I thought it was a fault , but knew it not Yet did repent me , after more advice For testimony whereof , one in the prison , That should by private order else have died , I have reserved alive .
I do but keep the peace . Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
Ah , for our father , for our dear lord Clarence
What , drawn , and talk of peace I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee . Have at thee , coward
Alas for both , both mine , Edward and Clarence
What stay had I but Edward And he’s gone .
Clubs , bills , and partisans Strike Beat them down Down with the Capulets Down with the Montagues
What stay had we but Clarence And he’s gone .
What noise is this Give me my long sword , ho
What stays had I but they And they are gone .
A crutch , a crutch Why call you for a sword
Was never widow had so dear a loss .
Were never orphans had so dear a loss .
No , my good lord , for that is not forgot Which ne’er I did remember to my knowledge , I never in my life did look on him .
Was never mother had so dear a loss . Alas , I am the mother of these griefs . Their woes are parceled mine are general . She for an Edward weeps , and so do I I for a Clarence weep so doth not she . These babes for Clarence weep and so do I I for an Edward weep so do not they . Alas , you three , on me , threefold distressed , Pour all your tears . I am your sorrow’s nurse , And I will pamper it with lamentations .
Then learn to know him now this is the duke .
My gracious lord , I tender you my service , Such as it is , being tender , raw and young Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert .
My sword , I say Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .
Thou villain Capulet Hold me not . Let me go .
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
Believe me , lord , I think he cannot choose .
It would seem strange unto him when he waked .
Even as a flatt ring dream or worthless fancy . Then take him up and manage well the jest . Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures . Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet . Procure me music ready when he wakes , To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound . And if he chance to speak , be ready straight And with a low submissive reverence Say , What is it your Honor will command Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose water and bestrewed with flowers , Another bear the ewer , the third a diaper , And say , Will ’t please your Lordship cool your hands Someone be ready with a costly suit And ask him what apparel he will wear . Another tell him of his hounds and horse , And that his lady mourns at his disease . Persuade him that he hath been lunatic , And when he says he is , say that he dreams , For he is nothing but a mighty lord . This do , and do it kindly , gentle sirs . It will be pastime passing excellent If it be husbanded with modesty .
My lord , I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is .
Though justice be thy plea , consider this That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation . We do pray for mercy , And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy . I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea , Which if thou follow , this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there .
My deeds upon my head . I crave the law , The penalty , and forfeit of my bond .
Is he not able to discharge the money
Yes , here I tender it for him in the court Yea , twice the sum . If that will not suffice , I will be bound to pay it ten times o er , On forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart . If this will not suffice , it must appear That malice bears down truth . And I beseech you , Wrest once the law to your authority . To do a great right , do a little wrong , And curb this cruel devil of his will .
Good Ursula , wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise .
I will , lady .
And bid her come hither .
Well .
Troth , I think your other rebato were better .
No , pray thee , good Meg , I’ll wear this .
It must not be . There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree establishèd . Twill be recorded for a precedent , And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state . It cannot be .
A Daniel come to judgment , yea , a Daniel O wise young judge , how I do honor thee
By my troth , ’s not so good , and I warrant your cousin will say so .
My cousin’s a fool , and thou art another . I’ll wear none but this .
Comfort , dear mother . God is much displeased That you take with unthankfulness , his doing . In common worldly things , ’tis called ungrateful With dull unwillingness to repay a debt Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent Much more to be thus opposite with heaven , For it requires the royal debt it lent you .
I like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner and your gown’s a most rare fashion , i faith . I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so .
Madam , bethink you , like a careful mother , Of the young prince your son . Send straight for him . Let him be crowned . In him your comfort lives . Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward’s grave And plant your joys in living Edward’s throne .
Oh , that exceeds , they say .
Sister , have comfort . All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star , But none can help our harms by wailing them . Madam , my mother , I do cry you mercy I did not see your Grace . Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing .
God bless thee , and put meekness in thy breast , Love , charity , obedience , and true duty .
I thank thee , gentle Percy and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul remembering my good friends And , as my fortune ripens with thy love , It shall be still thy true love’s recompense My heart this covenant makes , my hand thus seals it .
And make me die a good old man That is the butt end of a mother’s blessing I marvel that her Grace did leave it out .
How far is it to Berkeley and what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of war
There stands the castle , by yon tuft of trees , Mann’d with three hundred men , as I have heard And in it are the Lords of York , Berkeley , and Seymour None else of name and noble estimate .
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby , Bloody with spurring , fiery red with haste .
Welcome , my lords . I wot your love pursues A banish’d traitor all my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks , which more enrich’d Shall be your love and labour’s recompense .
Your presence makes us rich , most noble lord .
And far surmounts our labour to attain it .
Evermore thanks , the exchequer of the poor Which , till my infant fortune comes to years , Stands for my bounty . But who comes here
Rebellious subjects , enemies to peace , Profaners of this neighbor stainèd steel Will they not hear What , ho You men , you beasts , That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins , On pain of torture , from those bloody hands Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground , And hear the sentence of your movèd prince . Three civil brawls , bred of an airy word , By thee , old Capulet , and Montague , Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets And made Verona’s ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments , To wield old partisans in hands as old , Cankered with peace , to part your cankered hate . If ever you disturb our streets again , Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace . For this time , all the rest depart away . You , Capulet , shall go along with me , And , Montague , come you this afternoon To know our farther pleasure in this case , To old Free town , our common judgment place . Once more , on pain of death , all men depart .
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach Speak , nephew . Were you by when it began
What’s he
His name is Barnardine .
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio . Go fetch him hither let me look upon him .
I am sorry , one so learned and so wise As you , Lord Angelo , have still appear’d , Should slip so grossly , both in the heat of blood . And lack of temper’d judgment afterward .
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart That I crave death more willingly than mercy ’Tis my deserving , and I do entreat it .
Which is that Barnardine
This , my lord .
There was a friar told me of this man . Sirrah , thou art said to have a stubborn soul . That apprehends no further than this world , And squarest thy life according . Thou’rt condemn’d But , for those earthly faults , I quit them all And pray thee take this mercy to provide For better times to come . Friar , advise him I leave him to your hand . What muffled fellow’s that
I pray you , let me look upon the bond .
Here ’tis , most reverend doctor , here it is .
Shylock , there’s thrice thy money offered thee .
An oath , an oath , I have an oath in heaven . Shall I lay perjury upon my soul No , not for Venice .
Why , this bond is forfeit And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant’s heart . Be merciful . Take thrice thy money . Bid me tear the bond .
When it is paid according to the tenor . It doth appear you are a worthy judge . You know the law . Your exposition Hath been most sound . I charge you by the law , Whereof you are a well deserving pillar , Proceed to judgment . By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me . I stay here on my bond .
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment .
Why then , thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife .
O noble judge O excellent young man
I’ll send her to you presently , And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way , that your converse and business May be more free .
I humbly thank you for’t .
I never knew a Florentine more kind and honest .
Good morrow , good Lieutenant . I am sorry For your displeasure , but all will sure be well . The general and his wife are talking of it , And she speaks for you stoutly . The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you . But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again .
Yet I beseech you , If you think fit , or that it may be done , Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone .
Pray you come in . I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely .
I am much bound to you .
By my troth , ’s but a nightgown in respect of yours cloth o gold , and cuts , and laced with silver , set with pearls , down sleeves , side sleeves , and skirts , round underborne with a bluish tinsel . But for a fine , quaint , graceful , and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on ’t .
God give me joy to wear it , for my heart is exceeding heavy .
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man .
Fie upon thee Art not ashamed
Of what , lady Of speaking honorably Is not marriage honorable in a beggar Is not your lord honorable without marriage I think you would have me say , Saving your reverence , a husband . An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking , I’ll offend nobody . Is there any harm in the heavier for a husband None , I think , an it be the right husband and the right wife . Otherwise , ’tis light and not heavy . Ask my Lady Beatrice else . Here she comes .
Good morrow , coz .
Good morrow , sweet Hero .
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty , Which here appeareth due upon the bond .
Tis very true . O wise and upright judge How much more elder art thou than thy looks
Therefore lay bare your bosom .
Ay , his breast . So says the bond . Doth it not , noble judge Nearest his heart those are the very words .
It is so . Are there balance here to weigh The flesh
Take him up gently , and to bed with him , And each one to his office when he wakes .
Sirrah , go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds .
Belike some noble gentleman that means , Traveling some journey , to repose him here .
I have them ready .
How now who is it
Have by some surgeon , Shylock , on your charge , To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .
An’t please your Honor , players That offer service to your Lordship .
Is it so nominated in the bond
Bid them come near .
It is not so expressed , but what of that Twere good you do so much for charity .
Now , fellows , you are welcome .
I cannot find it . Tis not in the bond .
We thank your Honor .
These letters give , Iago , to the pilot , And by him do my duties to the senate . That done , I will be walking on the works , Repair there to me .
Do you intend to stay with me tonight
You , merchant , have you any thing to say
Well , my good lord , I’ll do ’t .
So please your Lordship to accept our duty .
But little . I am armed and well prepared . Give me your hand , Bassanio . Fare you well .
This fortification , gentlemen , shall we see ’t
With all my heart . This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son . Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well . I have forgot your name , but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed .
We’ll wait upon your lordship .
You cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan , Now cheer each other in each other’s love . Though we have spent our harvest of this king , We are to reap the harvest of his son . The broken rancor of your high swoll n hates , But lately splintered , knit , and joined together , Must gently be preserved , cherished , and kept . Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London , to be crowned our king .
Why with some little train , my Lord of Buckingham
Marry , my lord , lest by a multitude The new healed wound of malice should break out , Which would be so much the more dangerous By how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned . Where every horse bears his commanding rein And may direct his course as please himself , As well the fear of harm as harm apparent , In my opinion , ought to be prevented .
I hope the king made peace with all of us And the compact is firm and true in me .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach . I drew to part them . In the instant came The fiery Tybalt , with his sword prepared , Which , as he breathed defiance to my ears , He swung about his head and cut the winds , Who , nothing hurt withal , hissed him in scorn . While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .
Oh , where is Romeo Saw you him today Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
Madam , an hour before the worshipped sun Peered forth the golden window of the east , A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad , Where , underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side , So early walking did I see your son . Towards him I made , but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood . I , measuring his affections by my own , Which then most sought where most might not be found , Being one too many by my weary self , Pursued my humor not pursuing his , And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs . But all so soon as the all cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,
This is another prisoner that I saved . Who should have died when Claudio lost his head As like almost to Claudio as himself .
You , sirrah , that knew me for a fool , a coward , One all of luxury , an ass , a madman Wherein have I so deserved of you , That you extol me thus
’Faith , my lord . I spoke it but according to the trick . If you will hang me for it , you may but I had rather it would please you I might be whipt .
Whipt first , sir , and hanged after . Proclaim it , provost , round about the city . Is any woman wrong’d by this lewd fellow , As I have heard him swear himself there’s one Whom he begot with child , let her appear , And he shall marry her the nuptial finish’d , Let him be whipt and hang’d .
And so in me , and so , I think , in all . Yet since it is but green , it should be put To no apparent likelihood of breach , Which haply by much company might be urged . Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
Why , how now Do you speak in the sick tune
It is my Lord of Berkeley , as I guess .
I am out of all other tune , methinks .
My Lord of Hereford , my message is to you .
Clap ’s into Light o love . That goes without a burden . Do you sing it , and I’ll dance it .
My lord , my answer is to Lancaster And I am come to seek that name in England And I must find that title in your tongue , Before I make reply to aught you say .
Ye light o love , with your heels Then , if your husband have stables enough , you’ll see he shall lack no barns .
Mistake me not , my lord ’tis not my meaning To raze one title of your honour out To you , my lord , I come , what lord you will , From the most gracious regent of this land , The Duke of York , to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time And fright our native peace with self born arms .
O illegitimate construction I scorn that with my heels .
I shall not need transport my words by you Here comes his grace in person . My noble uncle
Tis almost five o clock , cousin . Tis time you were ready . By my troth , I am exceeding ill . Heigh ho
Show me thy humble heart , and not thy knee , Whose duty is deceiveable and false .
For a hawk , a horse , or a husband
My gracious uncle
For the letter that begins them all , H .
Well , an you be not turned Turk , there’s no more sailing by the star .
Tut , tut Grace me no grace , nor uncle me no uncle I am no traitor’s uncle and that word ‘grace . ’ In an ungracious mouth is but profane . Why have those banish’d and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of England’s ground But then more ‘why ’ why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom , Frighting her pale faced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms Comest thou because the anointed king is hence Why , foolish boy , the king is left behind , And in my loyal bosom lies his power . Were I but now the lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt , thy father , and myself Rescued the Black Prince , that young Mars of men , From forth the ranks of many thousand French , O , then how quickly should this arm of mine . Now prisoner to the palsy , chastise thee And minister correction to thy fault
What means the fool , trow
Nothing , I but God send everyone their heart’s desire .
These gloves the Count sent me , they are an excellent perfume .
And so say I .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night . Black and portentous must this humor prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
Have you importuned him by any means
Both by myself and many other friends . But he , his own affections counselor , Is to himself I will not say how true , But to himself so secret and so close , So far from sounding and discovery , As is the bud bit with an envious worm , Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air , Or dedicate his beauty to the same . Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow . We would as willingly give cure as know .
See , where he comes . So please you , step aside . I’ll know his grievance or be much denied .
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift . Come , madam , let’s away .
I beseech your highness , do not marry me to a whore . Your highness said even now , I made you a duke good my lord , do not recompense me in making me a cuckold .
Upon mine honour , thou shalt marry her . Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits . Take him to prison And see our pleasure herein executed .
Marrying a punk , my lord , is pressing to death , whipping , and hanging .
Slandering a prince deserves it .
She , Claudio , that you wrong’d , look you restore . Joy to you , Mariana Love her , Angelo I have confess’d her and I know her virtue . Thanks , good friend Escalus , for thy much goodne There’s more behind that is more gratulate . Thanks , provost , for thy care and secrecy We shill employ thee in a worthier place . Forgive him , Angelo , that brought you home The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s The offence pardons itself . Dear Isabel , I have a motion much imports your good Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline , What’s mine is yours and what is yours is mine . So , bring us to our palace where we’ll show What’s yet behind , that’s meet you all should know .
My gracious uncle , let me know my fault On what condition stands it and wherein
Even in condition of the worst degree , In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banish’d man , and here art come Before the expiration of thy time , In braving arms against thy sovereign .
As I was banish’d , I was banish’d Hereford But as I come , I come for Lancaster . And , noble uncle , I beseech your grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father , for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O , then , my father , Will you permit that I shall stand condemn’d A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Pluck’d from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born If that my cousin king be King of England , It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster . You have a son , Aumerle , my noble cousin Had you first died , and he been thus trod down , He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father , To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay . I am denied to sue my livery here , And yet my letters patents give me leave My father’s goods are all distrain’d and sold , And these and all are all amiss employ’d . What would you have me do I am a subject , And I challenge law attorneys are denied me And therefore , personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent .
Good morrow , cousin .
Is the day so young
But new struck nine .
Ay me Sad hours seem long . Was that my father that went hence so fast
It was . What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours
Not having that which , having , makes them short .
In love
Out .
Of love
Out of her favor , where I am in love .
Alas , that love , so gentle in his view , Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
Alas , that love , whose view is muffled still , Should , without eyes , see pathways to his will Where shall we dine O me What fray was here Yet tell me not , for I have heard it all . Here’s much to do with hate but more with love . Why then , O brawling love , O loving hate , O anything of nothing first created O heavy lightness , serious vanity , Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms Feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health , Still waking sleep , that is not what it is This love feel I , that feel no love in this . Dost thou not laugh
Then be it so , and go we to determine Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow . Madam , and you , my sister , will you go To give your censures in this business
My lord , whoever journeys to the prince , For God’s sake let not us two at home . For by the way I’ll sort occasion , As index to the story we late talked of , To part the queen’s proud kindred from the prince .
My other self , my council’s consistory , My oracle , my prophet , my dear cousin , I , as a child , will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then , for we’ll not stay behind .
Grieve not that I am fall n to this for you , For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom . It is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth , To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty from which lingering penance Of such misery doth she cut me off . Commend me to your honorable wife . Tell her the process of Antonio’s end . Say how I loved you . Speak me fair in death . And when the tale is told , bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love . Repent but you that you shall lose your friend , And he repents not that he pays your debt . For if the Jew do cut but deep enough , I’ll pay it presently with all my heart .
Antonio , I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself . But life itself , my wife , and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life . I would lose all ay , sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver you .
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer .
I have a wife , whom I protest I love . I would she were in heaven , so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew .
Tis well you offer it behind her back . The wish would make else an unquiet house .
I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means .
Tis very true . Thou didst it excellent . Well , you are come to me in happy time , The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much . There is a lord will hear you play tonight But I am doubtful of your modesties , Lest over eyeing of his odd behavior For yet his Honor never heard a play You break into some merry passion And so offend him . For I tell you , sirs , If you should smile , he grows impatient .
Fear not , my lord , we can contain ourselves Were he the veriest antic in the world .
Go , sirrah , take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one . Let them want nothing that my house affords .
Sirrah , go you to Barthol’mew , my page , And see him dressed in all suits like a lady . That done , conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber And call him madam , do him obeisance . Tell him from me , as he will win my love , He bear himself with honorable action , Such as he hath observed in noble ladies Unto their lords , by them accomplishèd .
Be thou assured , good Cassio , I will do All my abilities in thy behalf .
Good madam , do . I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his .
Oh , that’s an honest fellow . Do not doubt , Cassio , But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were .
Bounteous madam , Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio , He’s never anything but your true servant .
I know ’t , I thank you . You do love my lord . You have known him long , and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a polite distance .
Ay , but , lady , That policy may either last so long , Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , Or breed itself so out of circumstances , That , I being absent and my place supplied , My general will forget my love and service .
Do not doubt that . Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place . Assure thee , If I do vow a friendship , I’ll perform it To the last article . My lord shall never rest , I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience .
I am stuffed , cousin . I cannot smell .
A maid , and stuffed There’s goodly catching of cold .
Oh , God help me , God help me How long have you professed apprehension
Even since you left it . Doth not my wit become me rarely
It is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap . By my troth , I am sick .
Get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus and lay it to your heart . It is the only thing for a qualm .
There thou prick’st her with a thistle .
Benedictus Why benedictus You have some moral in this benedictus
No , coz , I rather weep .
Good heart , at what
At thy good heart’s oppression .
Why , such is love’s transgression . Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast , Which thou wilt propagate , to have it pressed With more of thine . This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own . Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs Being purged , a fire sparkling in lovers eyes Being vexed , a sea nourished with loving tears . What is it else A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet . Farewell , my coz .
Soft I will go along . And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
Tut , I have lost myself . I am not here . This is not Romeo . He’s some other where .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
What , shall I groan and tell thee
Groan Why , no . But sadly , tell me who .
Moral No , by my troth , I have no moral meaning . I meant plain holy thistle . You may think perchance that I think you are in love . Nay , by r Lady , I am not such a fool to think what I list , nor I list not to think what I can , nor indeed I cannot think , if I would think my heart out of thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love . Yet Benedick was such another , and now is he become a man . He swore he would never marry , and yet now , in despite of his heart , he eats his meat without grudging . And how you may be converted I know not , but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do .
These be the Christian husbands . I have a daughter . Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband rather than a Christian We trifle time . I pray thee , pursue sentence .
A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine . The court awards it , and the law doth give it .
Most rightful judge
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast . The law allows it , and the court awards it .
Most learnèd judge , a sentence Come , prepare .
Tarry a little . There is something else . This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood . The words expressly are a pound of flesh . Take then thy bond , take thou thy pound of flesh , But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood , thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice .
O upright judge Mark , Jew . O learnèd judge
Is that the law
Thyself shalt see the act . For as thou urgest justice , be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest .
Such duty to the drunkard let him do With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy , And say , What is ’t your Honor will command , Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love And then with kind embracements , tempting kisses , And with declining head into his bosom , Bid him shed tears , as being overjoyed To see her noble lord restored to health , Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar . And if the boy have not a woman’s gift To rain a shower of commanded tears , An onion will do well for such a shift , Which in a napkin being close conveyed Shall in despite enforce a watery eye . See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst Anon I’ll give thee more instructions .
I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action of a gentlewoman . I long to hear him call the drunkard husband , And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant . I’ll in to counsel them . Haply my presence May well abate the over merry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes .
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast
I promise you I scarcely know myself . Hear you the news abroad
Yes , that the king is dead .
Ill news , by r Lady . Seldom comes the better . I fear , I fear , ’twill prove a giddy world .
Neighbors , God speed .
Give you good morrow , sir .
Doth this news hold of good King Edward’s death
Ay , sir , it is too true , God help the while .
Then , masters , look to see a troublous world .
No , no , by God’s good grace , his son shall reign .
Woe to the land that’s governed by a child .
In him there is a hope of government , Which , in his nonage , council under him , And , in his full and ripened years , himself , No doubt shall then , and till then , govern well .
The noble duke hath been too much abused .
It stands your grace upon to do him right .
Base men by his endowments are made great .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill . In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved .
A right good markman And she’s fair I love .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
My lords of England , let me tell you this I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs And laboured all I could to do him right But in this kind to come , in braving arms , Be his own carver and cut out his way , To find out right with wrong , it may not be And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels all .
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid And let him ne’er see joy that breaks that oath
His bed shall seem a school , his board a shrift , I’ll intermingle everything he does With Cassio’s suit . Therefore be merry , Cassio , For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away .
Well , well , I see the issue of these arms I cannot mend it , I must needs confess , Because my power is weak and all ill left But if I could , by Him that gave me life , I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the king But since I cannot , be it known to you I do remain as neuter . So , fare you well Unless you please to enter in the castle And there repose you for this night .
Madam , here comes my lord .
Madam , I’ll take my leave .
Why , stay and hear me speak .
Madam , not now . I am very ill at ease , Unfit for mine own purposes .
Well , do your discretion .
Ha I like not that .
What dost thou say
Nothing , my lord , or if I know not what .
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
Cassio , my lord No , sure , I cannot think it That he would steal away so guilty like Seeing you coming .
I do believe ’twas he .
Well , in that hit you miss . She’ll not be hit With Cupid’s arrow . She hath Dian’s wit . And , in strong proof of chastity well armed From love’s weak childish bow , she lives uncharmed . She will not stay the siege of loving terms , Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes , Nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold . Oh , she is rich in beauty , only poor That when she dies , with beauty dies her store .
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
O learnèd judge Mark , Jew , a learnèd judge
I take this offer then pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go .
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity . She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair . She hath forsworn to love , and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now .
Here is the money .
Be ruled by me . Forget to think of her .
Soft The Jew shall have all justice . Soft , no haste . He shall have nothing but the penalty .
O , teach me how I should forget to think
O Jew An upright judge , a learnèd judge
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh . Shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh . If thou takest more Or less than a just pound , be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple nay , if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair , Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate .
A second Daniel A Daniel , Jew Now , infidel , I have you on the hip .
Why doth the Jew pause Take thy forfeiture .
Give me my principal , and let me go .
I have it ready for thee . Here it is .
By giving liberty unto thine eyes . Examine other beauties .
Tis the way To call hers exquisite , in question more . These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair . He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost . Show me a mistress that is passing fair What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who passed that passing fair Farewell . Thou canst not teach me to forget .
He hath refused it in the open court . He shall have merely justice and his bond .
A Daniel , still say I , a second Daniel I thank thee , Jew , for teaching me that word .
I’ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt .
Shall I not have barely my principal
How now , my lord I have been talking with a suitor here , A man that languishes in your displeasure .
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril , Jew .
Who is ’t you mean
Why then , the devil give him good of it I’ll stay no longer question .
Why , your lieutenant , Cassio . Good my lord , If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take . For if he be not one that truly loves you , That errs in ignorance and not in cunning , I have no judgment in an honest face . I prithee , call him back .
Went he hence now
Tarry , Jew . The law hath yet another hold on you . It is enacted in the laws of Venice , If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen , The party gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods . The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state , And the offender’s life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only gainst all other voice . In which predicament I say thou stand’st , For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant , and thou hast incurred The danger formerly by me rehearsed . Down , therefore , and beg mercy of the Duke .
Ay , sooth , so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him . Good love , call him back .
Not now , sweet Desdemona . Some other time .
But shall ’t be shortly
The sooner , sweet , for you .
Shall ’t be tonight at supper
No , not tonight .
Tomorrow dinner , then
I shall not dine at home , I meet the captains at the citadel .
An offer , uncle , that we will accept But we must win your grace to go with us To Bristol castle , which they say is held By Bushy , Bagot and their complices , The caterpillars of the commonwealth , Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away .
It may be I will go with you but yet I’ll pause For I am loath to break our country’s laws . Nor friends nor foes , to me welcome you are Things past redress are now with me past care .
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps
Not a false gallop .
Madam , withdraw the Prince , the Count , Signor Benedick , Don John , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .
Help to dress me , good coz , good Meg , good Ursula .
For God’s sake , a pot of small ale .
Will ’t please your Lordship drink a cup of sack
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves
What raiment will your Honor wear today
I am Christophero Sly . Call not me Honor nor Lordship . I ne er drank sack in my life . An if you give me any conserves , give me conserves of beef . Ne er ask me what raiment I’ll wear , for I have no more doublets than backs , no more stockings than legs , nor no more shoes than feet , nay sometime more feet than shoes , or such shoes as my toes look through the over leather .
Heaven cease this idle humor in your Honor Oh , that a mighty man of such descent , Of such possessions and so high esteem , Should be infusèd with so foul a spirit
But Montague is bound as well as I , In penalty alike . And ’tis not hard , I think , For men so old as we to keep the peace .
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old .
Why , then , tomorrow night , or Tuesday morn . On Tuesday noon , or night , or Wednesday morn . I prithee name the time , but let it not Exceed three days . In faith , he’s penitent , And yet his trespass , in our common reason is not , almost , a fault T incur a private check . When shall he come Tell me , Othello . I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mamm ring on . What Michael Cassio That came a wooing with you , and so many a time , When I have spoke of you dispraisingly , Hath ta en your part , to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me , I could do much
Of honorable reckoning are you both . And pity ’tis you lived at odds so long . But now , my lord , what say you to my suit
Stood the state so No , no , good friends , God wot , For then this land was famously enriched With politic grave counsel then the king Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace .
Prithee , no more . Let him come when he will , I will deny thee nothing .
But saying o er what I have said before . My child is yet a stranger in the world . She hath not seen the change of fourteen years . Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride .
Why , so hath this , both by the father and mother .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .
Why , this is not a boon , Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves , Or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person . Nay , when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted .
Better it were they all came by his father , Or by the father there were none at all , For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not . O , full of danger is the duke of Gloucester , And the queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud , And were they to be ruled , and not to rule , This sickly land might solace as before .
I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee , grant me this , To leave me but a little to myself .
Come , come , we fear the worst . All will be well .
And too soon marred are those so early made . Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she . She’s the hopeful lady of my earth . But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart . My will to her consent is but a part . An she agreed within her scope of choice , Lies my consent and fair according voice . This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love . And you among the store , One more , most welcome , makes my number more . At my poor house look to behold this night Earth treading stars that make dark heaven light .
Shall I deny you No . Farewell , my lord .
Farewell , my Desdemona . I’ll come to thee straight .
When clouds are seen , wise men put on their cloaks When great leaves fall , then winter is at hand When the sun sets , who doth not look for night Untimely storms make men expect a dearth . All may be well but if God sort it so , Tis more than we deserve or I expect .
Truly , the hearts of men are full of fear . Ye cannot reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and full of dread .
Boatswain
Here , master . What cheer
Good , speak to th mariners . Fall to ’t yarely , or we run ourselves aground . Bestir , bestir .
Heigh , my hearts Cheerly , cheerly , my hearts Yare Yare Take in the topsail . Tend to th master’s whistle . Blow , till thou burst thy wind , if room enough
Good Boatswain , have care . Where’s the Master Play the men .
I pray now , keep below .
Where is the Master , Boatswain
What would you with me , honest neighbor
Marry , sir , I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly .
Brief , I pray you , for you see it is a busy time with me .
Marry , this it is , sir .
Yes , in truth it is , sir .
What is it , my good friends
Goodman Verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter . An old man , sir , and his wits are not so blunt as , God help , I would desire they were , but , in faith , honest as the skin between his brows .
Yes , I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I .
Comparisons are odorous . Palabras , neighbor Verges .
Neighbors , you are tedious .
It pleases your Worship to say so , but we are the poor duke’s officers . But truly , for mine own part , if I were as tedious as a king , I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .
My lord of Salisbury , we have stay’d ten days , And hardly kept our countrymen together , And yet we hear no tidings from the king Therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell .
Stay yet another day , thou trusty Welshman The king reposeth all his confidence in thee .
’Tis thought the king is dead we will not stay . The bay trees in our country are all wither’d And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven The pale faced moon looks bloody on the earth And lean look’d prophets whisper fearful change Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap , The one in fear to lose what they enjoy , The other to enjoy by rage and war These signs forerun the death or fall of kings . Farewell our countrymen are gone and fled , As well assured Richard their king is dead .
Ah , Richard , with the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament . Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west , Witnessing storms to come , woe and unrest Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes , And crossly to thy good all fortune goes .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads . Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house . Hear all , all see , And like her most whose merit most shall be Which on more view of many , mine , being one , May stand in number , though in reckoning none , Come , go with me .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona . Find those persons out Whose names are written there , and to them say My house and welcome on their pleasure stay .
Find them out whose names are written here It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets . But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ . I must to the learned in good time
Tut man , one fire burns out another’s burning . One pain is lessened by another’s anguish . Turn giddy , and be helped by backward turning . One desperate grief cures with another’s languish . Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
Emilia , come . Be as your fancies teach you . Whate er you be , I am obedient .
Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee And when I love thee not Chaos is come again .
My noble lord
What dost thou say , Iago
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself , And yet , thy wealth being forfeit to the state , Thou hast not left the value of a cord . Therefore thou must be hanged at the state’s charge .
What , would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly , old Sly’s son of Burton Heath , by birth a peddler , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bearherd , and now by present profession a tinker Ask Marian Hacket , the fat alewife of Wincot , if she know me not If she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale , score me up for the lying’st knave in Christendom . What I am not bestraught Here’s
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it . For half thy wealth , it is Antonio’s . The other half comes to the general state , Which humbleness may drive unto a fine .
Oh , this it is that makes your lady mourn
Oh , this is it that makes your servants droop
Ay , for the state , not for Antonio .
Did Michael Cassio , when you wooed my lady , Know of your love
Nay , take my life and all . Pardon not that . You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house . You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live .
Do you not hear him You mar our labor . Keep your cabins . You do assist the storm .
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house , As beaten hence by your strange lunacy . O noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth , Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , And banish hence these abject lowly dreams . Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck . Wilt thou have music Hark Apollo plays ,
He did , from first to last . Why dost thou ask
Nay , good , be patient .
But for a satisfaction of my thought , No further harm .
When the sea is . Hence What cares these roarers for the name of king To cabin , silence Trouble us not .
Why of thy thought , Iago
Good , yet remember whom thou hast aboard .
I did not think he had been acquainted with her .
None that I more love than myself . You are a councilor . If you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present , we will not hand a rope more . Use your authority . If you cannot , give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour , if it so hap . Cheerly , good hearts Out of our way , I say .
Oh , yes , and went between us very oft .
I have great comfort from this fellow . Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him . His complexion is perfect gallows . Stand fast , good Fate , to his hanging . Make the rope of his destiny our cable , for our own doth little advantage . If he be not born to be hanged , our case is miserable .
Indeed
Indeed Ay , indeed Discern’st thou aught in that Is he not honest
Honest , my lord
What mercy can you render him , Antonio
A halter gratis , nothing else , for God’s sake .
All thy tediousness on me , ah
Yea , an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis , for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city , and though I be but a poor man , I am glad to hear it .
And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing Or wilt thou sleep We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis . Say thou wilt walk , we will bestrew the ground . Or wilt thou ride Thy horses shall be trapped , Their harness studded all with gold and pearl . Dost thou love hawking Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark . Or wilt thou hunt Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth .
And so am I .
I would fain know what you have to say .
Marry , sir , our watch tonight , excepting your Worship’s presence , ha ta en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina .
A good old man , sir . He will be talking . As they say , When the age is in , the wit is out . God help us , it is a world to see Well said , i faith , neighbor Verges . Well , God’s a good man . An two men ride of a horse , one must ride behind . An honest soul , i faith , sir , by my troth he is , as ever broke bread , but God is to be worshipped , all men are not alike , alas , good neighbor
Indeed , neighbor , he comes too short of you .
Gifts that God gives .
I must leave you .
One word , sir . Our watch , sir , have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons , and we would have them this morning examined before your worship .
So please my lord the duke and all the court , To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content , so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter . Two things provided more that for this favor He presently become a Christian The other , that he do record a gift Here in the court , of all he dies possessed , Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter .
Before the days of change , still is it so . By a divine instinct , men’s minds mistrust Ensuing dangers , as by proof we see The water swell before a boist rous storm . But leave it all to God . Whither away
Marry , we were sent for to the justices .
And so was I . I’ll bear you company .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
For what , I pray thee
For your broken shin .
Why Romeo , art thou mad
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and Good e en , good fellow .
God i good e en . I pray , sir , can you read
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
Perhaps you have learned it without book . But I pray , can you read anything you see
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .
Ye say honestly . Rest you merry .
Stay , fellow . I can read . Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters County Anselme and his beauteous sisters The lady widow of Vitruvio Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters My fair niece Rosaline and Livia
Down with the topmast Yare , lower , lower Bring her to try wi th main course .
A plague upon this howling They are louder than the weather or our office .
Yet again What do you here Shall we give o er and drown Have you a mind to sink
A pox o your throat , you bawling , blasphemous , incharitable dog
Work you , then .
Hang , cur Hang , you whoreson insolent noisemaker We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art .
I’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
Lay her a hold , a hold Set her two courses off to sea again . Lay her off
All lost To prayers , to prayers , all lost
Say thou wilt course . Thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags , ay , fleeter than the roe .
Dost thou love pictures We will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook And Cytherea all in sedges hid , Which seem to move and wanton with her breath , Even as the waving sedges play with wind .
We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid And how she was beguileèd and surprised , As lively painted as the deed was done .
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood , Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds , And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep , So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn .
Thou art a lord , and nothing but a lord . Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age .
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o errun her lovely face , She was the fairest creature in the world And yet she is inferior to none .
Take their examination yourself and bring it me . I am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .
It shall be suffigance .
Drink some wine ere you go . Fare you well .
My lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
I’ll wait upon them . I am ready .
Go , good partner , go , get you to Francis Seacole . Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail . We are now to examination these men .
And we must do it wisely .
He shall do this , or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronouncèd here .
We will spare for no wit , I warrant you . Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome . Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the jail .
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena . A fair assembly . Whither should they come
Art thou contented , Jew What dost thou say
I am content .
Clerk , draw a deed of gift .
I pray you , give me leave to go from hence . I am not well . Send the deed after me , And I will sign it .
Get thee gone , but do it .
In christening shalt thou have two godfathers . Had I been judge , thou shouldst have had ten more To bring thee to the gallows , not to the font .
Sir , I entreat you home with me to dinner .
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon . I must away this night toward Padua , And it is meet I presently set forth .
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not . Antonio , gratify this gentleman , For in my mind you are much bound to him .
Honest , ay , honest .
My lord , for aught I know .
What dost thou think
Think , my lord
Think , my lord Alas , thou echo’st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown . Thou dost mean something . I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that When Cassio left my wife . What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing , thou cried’st Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit . If thou dost love me Show me thy thought .
Up .
My lord , you know I love you .
Whither To supper
To our house .
I think thou dost . And for I know thou rt full of love and honesty And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath , Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more . For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom , but in a man that’s just They are close dilations , working from the heart , That passion cannot rule .
Whose house
For Michael Cassio , I dare be sworn , I think , that he is honest .
My master’s .
I think so too .
What , must our mouths be cold
The king and prince at prayers . Let’s assist them , for our case is as theirs .
I’m out of patience .
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards . This wide chopped rascal would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .
Now I’ll tell you without asking . My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine . Rest you merry
He’ll be hanged yet , though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him .
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona . Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood , then turn tears to fires , And these , who , often drowned , could never die , Transparent heretics , be burnt for liars One fairer than my love The all seeing sun Ne er saw her match since first the world begun .
Mercy on us We split , we split Farewell , my wife and children Farewell , brother We split , we split , we split
Let’s all sink wi th king .
Let’s take leave of him .
Am I a lord , and have I such a lady Or do I dream Or have I dreamed till now I do not sleep I see , I hear , I speak . I smell sweet savors and I feel soft things . Upon my life , I am a lord indeed And not a tinker , nor Christopher Sly . Well , bring our lady hither to our sight , And once again , a pot o the smallest ale .
Will ’t please your Mightiness to wash your hands O , how we joy to see your wit restored O , that once more you knew but what you are These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or , when you waked , so waked as if you slept .
Last night , I hear , they lay at Stony Stratford , And at Northampton they do rest tonight . Tomorrow or next day they will be here .
I long with all my heart to see the prince . I hope he is much grown since last I saw him .
But I hear no they say my son of York Has almost overta en him in his growth .
Ay , mother , but I would not have it so .
Why , my young cousin It is good to grow .
Grandam , one night as we did sit at supper , My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother Ay , quoth my uncle Gloucester , Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace . And since , methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .
Good faith , good faith , the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee He was the wretched’st thing when he was young , So long a growing and so leisurely , That if this rule were true , he should be gracious .
And so no doubt he is , my gracious madam .
These fifteen years By my fay , a goodly nap . But did I never speak of all that time
O , yes , my lord , but very idle words . For though you lay here in this goodly chamber , Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door And rail upon the hostess of the house , And say you would present her at the leet , Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts . Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket .
Ay , the woman’s maid of the house .
Why , sir , you know no house nor no such maid , Nor no such men as you have reckoned up , As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece , And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell , And twenty more such names and men as these , Which never were , nor no man ever saw .
Bring forth these men . Bushy and Green , I will not vex your souls Since presently your souls must part your bodies With too much urging your pernicious lives , For ’twere no charity yet , to wash your blood From off my hands , here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths . You have misled a prince , a royal king , A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments , By you unhappied and disfigured clean You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him , Broke the possession of a royal bed And stain’d the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs . Myself , a prince by fortune of my birth , Near to the king in blood , and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me , Have stoop’d my neck under your injuries , And sigh’d my English breath in foreign clouds , Eating the bitter bread of banishment Whilst you have fed upon my signories , Dispark’d my parks and fell’d my forest woods , From my own windows torn my household coat , Razed out my imprese , leaving me no sign , Save men’s opinions and my living blood , To show the world I am a gentleman . This and much more , much more than twice all this , Condemns you to the death . See them deliver’d over
Most worthy gentleman , I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties , in lieu whereof Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew We freely cope your courteous pains withal .
And stand indebted , over and above , In love and service to you evermore .
Come , Friar Francis , be brief , only to the plain form of marriage , and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards .
You come hither , my lord , to marry this lady
He is well paid that is well satisfied . And I , delivering you , am satisfied , And therein do account myself well paid . My mind was never yet more mercenary . I pray you , know me when we meet again . I wish you well , and so I take my leave .
No .
Dear sir , of force I must attempt you further . Take some remembrance of us as a tribute , Not as a fee . Grant me two things , I pray you Not to deny me , and to pardon me .
To be married to her . Friar , you come to marry her .
Lady , you come hither to be married to this count
You press me far and therefore I will yield . And for your love , I’ll take this ring from you . Do not draw back your hand . I’ll take no more , And you in love shall not deny me this .
I do .
This ring , good sir alas , it is a trifle . I will not shame myself to give you this .
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .
I will have nothing else but only this . And now methinks I have a mind to it .
Know you any , Hero
None , my lord .
Know you any , count
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends
Amen .
I thank thee . Thou shalt not lose by it .
How fares my noble lord
Marry , I fare well , For here is cheer enough . Where is my wife
Here , noble lord . What is thy will with her
Are you my wife and will not call me husband My men should call me lord . I am your goodman .
My husband and my lord , my lord and husband , I am your wife in all obedience .
I know it well . What must I call her
Madam .
Alice Madam , or Joan Madam
Madam , and nothing else . So lords call ladies .
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath , brown furze , anything . The wills above be done , but I would fain die a dry death .
I hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt .
Now , by my troth , if I had been remembered , I could have given my uncle’s grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .
How , my pretty York I prithee let me hear it .
Marry , they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old . Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth . Grandam , this would have been a biting jest .
To execution and the hand of death .
More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England . Lords , farewell .
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell .
My Lord Northumberland , see them dispatch’d .
I prithee , pretty York , who told thee this
Grandam , his nurse .
Uncle , you say the queen is at your house For God’s sake , fairly let her be entreated Tell her I send to her my kind commends Take special care my greetings be deliver’d .
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch’d With letters of your love to her at large .
Thank , gentle uncle . Come , lords , away . To fight with Glendower and his complices Awhile to work , and after holiday .
His nurse Why , she was dead ere thou wast born .
If ’twere not she , I cannot tell who told me .
A parlous boy Go to , you are too shrewd .
Good madam , be not angry with the child .
Pitchers have ears .
Here comes a messenger . What news
Such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
Men should be what they seem , Or those that be not , would they might seem none
Certain , men should be what they seem .
Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man .
Nay , yet there’s more in this . I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings , As thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words .
Good my lord , pardon me , Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to . Utter my thoughts Why , say they are vile and false , As where’s that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has that breast so pure Wherein uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit With meditations lawful
Thou dost conspire against thy friend , Iago , If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts .
I do beseech you , Though I perchance am vicious in my guess , As , I confess , it is my nature’s plague To spy into abuses , and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not , that your wisdom , From one that so imperfectly conceits , Would take no notice , nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance . It were not for your quiet nor your good ,
Tut , you saw her fair , none else being by , Herself poised with herself in either eye . But in that crystal scales let there be weighed Your lady’s love against some other maid That I will show you shining at the feast , And she shall scant show well that now shows best .
I’ll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
I dare make his answer , none .
O , what men dare do What men may do What men daily do , not knowing what they do
How now , interjections Why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he
Stand thee by , Friar . Father , by your leave , Will you with free and unconstrainèd soul Give me this maid , your daughter
As freely , son , as God did give her me .
There’s more depends on this than on the value . The dearest ring in Venice will I give you , And find it out by proclamation . Only for this , I pray you , pardon me .
I see , sir , you are liberal in offers . You taught me first to beg , and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered .
Good sir , this ring was given me by my wife . And when she put it on , she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it .
That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts . An if your wife be not a madwoman , And know how well I have deserved the ring , She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me . Well , peace be with you .
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift
Nothing , unless you render her again .
Sweet Prince , you learn me noble thankfulness . There , Leonato , take her back again . Give not this rotten orange to your friend . She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor . Behold how like a maid she blushes here Oh , what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue Would you not swear , All you that see her , that she were a maid By these exterior shows But she is none . She knows the heat of a luxurious bed . Her blush is guiltiness , not modesty .
My Lord Bassanio , let him have the ring . Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued against your wife’s commandment .
Go , Gratiano , run and overtake him . Give him the ring and bring him , if thou canst , Unto Antonio’s house . Away , make haste .
Come , you and I will thither presently . And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont . Come , Antonio .
Madam wife , they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more .
Ay , and the time seems thirty unto me , Being all this time abandoned from your bed .
Tis much . Servants , leave me and her alone . Madam , undress you and come now to bed .
Thrice noble lord , let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two , Or if not so , until the sun be set . For your physicians have expressly charged , In peril to incur your former malady , That I should yet absent me from your bed . I hope this reason stands for my excuse .
Ay , it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long . But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again . I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood .
Your Honor’s players , hearing your amendment , Are come to play a pleasant comedy , For so your doctors hold it very meet , Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood , And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy . Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment , Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life .
If by your art , my dearest father , you have Put the wild waters in this roar , allay them . The sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , But that the sea , mounting to th welkin’s cheek , Dashes the fire out . Oh , I have suffered With those that I saw suffer . A brave vessel Who had , no doubt , some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces . Oh , the cry did knock Against my very heart Poor souls , they perished . Had I been any god of power , I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her .
Be collected . No more amazement . Tell your piteous heart There’s no harm done .
Oh , woe the day
No harm . I have done nothing but in care of thee , Of thee , my dear one thee my daughter , who Art ignorant of what thou art , naught knowing Of whence I am , nor that I am more better Than Prospero , master of a full poor cell And thy no greater father .
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts .
What do you mean , my lord
Not to be married , Not to knit my soul to an approvèd wanton .
Dear my lord , if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity
I know what you would say if I have known her , You will say she did embrace me as a husband , And so extenuate the forehand sin . No , Leonato , I never tempted her with word too large But , as a brother to his sister , showed Bashful sincerity and comely love .
And seemed I ever otherwise to you
Out on thee , seeming I will write against it . You seem to me as Dian in her orb , As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown . But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus , or those pampered animals That rage in savage sensuality .
Is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide
Sweet Prince , why speak not you
What should I speak I stand dishonored , that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale .
Are these things spoken , or do I but dream
Inquire the Jew’s house out . Give him this deed , And let him sign it . We’ll away tonight , And be a day before our husbands home . This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo .
Fair sir , you are well o erta en . My Lord Bassanio upon more advice Hath sent you here this ring , and doth entreat Your company at dinner .
Marry , I will . Let them play it . Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling trick
That cannot be . His ring I do accept most thankfully . And so I pray you tell him . Furthermore , I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house .
No , my good lord , it is more pleasing stuff .
That will I do .
What , household stuff
I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring , Which I did make him swear to keep for ever .
It is a kind of history .
Well , we’ll see ’t . Come , madam wife , sit by my side and let the world slip . We shall ne er be younger .
Thou mayst , I warrant . We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men . But we’ll outface them , and outswear them too .
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand
Yea , my lord . How brooks your grace the air , After your late tossing on the breaking seas
Needs must I like it well I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again . Dear earth , I do salute thee with my hand , Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs As a long parted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting , So , weeping , smiling , greet I thee , my earth , And do thee favours with my royal hands . Feed not thy sovereign’s foe , my gentle earth , Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense But let thy spiders , that suck up thy venom , And heavy gaited toads lie in their way , Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower , Guard it , I pray thee , with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies . Mock not my senseless conjuration , lords This earth shall have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers , ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms .
Nor for my manhood , honesty , and wisdom To let you know my thoughts .
What dost thou mean
Good name in man and woman , dear my lord , Is the immediate jewel of their souls . Who steals my purse steals trash . Tis something , nothing Twas mine , ’tis his , and has been slave to thousands . But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed .
I’ll know thy thoughts .
You cannot , if my heart were in your hand , Nor shall not , whilst ’tis in my custody .
Ha
Oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy It is the green eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on . That cuckold lives in bliss Who , certain of his fate , loves not his wronger , But , oh , what damnèd minutes tells he o er Who dotes , yet doubts suspects , yet soundly loves
Oh , misery
Poor and content is rich , and rich enough , But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor . Good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy
How doth the prince
Well , madam , and in health .
What is thy news then
Nurse , where’s my daughter Call her forth to me .
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come . What , lamb What , ladybird God forbid Where’s this girl What , Juliet
How now , who calls
Your mother .
Madam , I am here . What is your will
This is the matter . Nurse , give leave awhile , We must talk in secret . Nurse , come back again . I have remembered me . Thou’s hear our counsel . Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
She’s not fourteen .
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four she is not fourteen . How long is it now to Lammastide
A fortnight and odd days .
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret , And , with them , Sir Thomas Vaughan , prisoners .
Who hath committed them
The mighty dukes , Gloucester and Buckingham .
For what offence
The sum of all I can , I have disclosed . Why , or for what , the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .
Away , make haste . Thou know’st where I will tarry .
Come , good sir . Will you show me to this house
Ay me I see the ruin of my house . The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind . Insulting tyranny begins to jut Upon the innocent and aweless throne . Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre . I see , as in a map , the end of all .
Tranio , since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua , nursery of arts , I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy , The pleasant garden of great Italy , And by my father’s love and leave am armed With his goodwill and thy good company . My trusty servant , well approved in all , Here let us breathe and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies . Pisa , renownèd for grave citizens , Gave me my being and my father first , A merchant of great traffic through the world , Vincentio , come of the Bentivolii . Vincentio’s son , brought up in Florence , It shall become to serve all hopes conceived To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds . And therefore , Tranio , for the time I study Virtue , and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achieved . Tell me thy mind , for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come , as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst .
Accursèd and unquiet wrangling days , How many of you have mine eyes beheld My husband lost his life to get the crown , And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss . And being seated , and domestic broils Clean overblown , themselves the conquerors Make war upon themselves , brother to brother , Blood to blood , self against self . O , preposterous And frantic outrage , end thy damnèd spleen , Or let me die , to look on death no more .
Come , come , my boy . We will to sanctuary . Madam , farewell .
Stay , I will go with you
You have no cause .
My gracious lady , go , And thither bear your treasure and your goods . For my part , I’ll resign unto your Grace The seal I keep and so betide to me As well I tender you and all of yours . Go . I’ll conduct you to the sanctuary .
Mi perdonato , gentle master mine . I am in all affected as yourself , Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy . Only , good master , while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline , Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks , I pray , Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured . Balk logic with acquaintance that you have , And practice rhetoric in your common talk Music and poesy use to quicken you The mathematics and the metaphysics Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you . No profit grows where is no pleasure ta en . In brief , sir , study what you most affect .
Gramercies , Tranio , well dost thou advise . If , Biondello , thou wert come ashore , We could at once put us in readiness And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget . But stay awhile . What company is this
Master , some show to welcome us to town .
Gentlemen , importune me no farther , For how I firmly am resolved you know That is , not to bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder . If either of you both love Katherina , Because I know you well and love you well Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure .
Tis time I should inform thee farther . Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me .
So , Lie there , my art . Wipe thou thine eyes . Have comfort . The direful spectacle of the wrack , which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee , I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul No , not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard’st cry , which thou sawst sink . Sit down . For thou must now know farther .
You have often Begun to tell me what I am , but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition , Concluding , Stay . Not yet .
The hour’s now come . The very minute bids thee ope thine ear . Obey and be attentive . Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell I do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not Out three years old .
Certainly , sir , I can .
By what By any other house or person Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen . Susan and she God rest all Christian souls Were of an age . Well , Susan is with God . She was too good for me . But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen . That shall she . Marry , I remember it well . Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned I never shall forget it Of all the days of the year , upon that day . For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall . My lord and you were then at Mantua . Nay , I do bear a brain . But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug Shake quoth the dovehouse . Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge . And since that time it is eleven years , For then she could stand alone . Nay , by the rood , She could have run and waddled all about , For even the day before , she broke her brow . And then my husband God be with his soul He was a merry man took up the child . Yea , quoth he , Dost thou fall upon thy face Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit , Wilt thou not , Jule and , by my holy dame , The pretty wretch left crying and said ay . To see now , how a jest shall come about I warrant , an I should live a thousand years , I never should forget it . Wilt thou not , Jule quoth he . And , pretty fool , it stinted and said ay .
Enough of this . I pray thee , hold thy peace .
Fear not , my lord that Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all . The means that heaven yields must be embraced , And not neglected else , if heaven would , And we will not , heaven’s offer we refuse , The proffer’d means of succor and redress .
He means , my lord , that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke , through our security , Grows strong and great in substance and in power .
Discomfortable cousin know’st thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid , Behind the globe , that lights the lower world , Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage , boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole , Then murders , treasons and detested sins , The cloak of night being pluck’d from off their backs , Stand bare and naked , trembling at themselves So when this thief , this traitor , Bolingbroke , Who all this while hath revell’d in the night Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes , Shall see us rising in our throne , the east , His treasons will sit blushing in his face , Not able to endure the sight of day , But self affrighted tremble at his sin . Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord For every man that Bolingbroke hath press’d To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown , God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel then , if angels fight , Weak men must fall , for heaven still guards the right .
Sir , they are spoken , and these things are true .
This looks not like a nuptial .
True O God
Leonato , stand I here Is this the Prince Is this the Prince’s brother Is this face Hero’s Are our eyes our own
All this is so , but what of this , my lord
Let me but move one question to your daughter , And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her , bid her answer truly .
I charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
Oh , God defend me how am I beset What kind of catechizing call you this
To make you answer truly to your name .
Is it not Hero Who can blot that name With any just reproach
Marry , that can Hero Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue . What man was he talked with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one Now , if you are a maid , answer to this .
I talked with no man at that hour , my lord .
Why , why is this Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy , To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is to be resolved . Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blowed surmises , Matching thy inference . Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , Is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances . Where virtue is , these are more virtuous . Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt , For she had eyes and chose me . No , Iago , I’ll see before I doubt , when I doubt , prove , And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy
The moon shines bright . In such a night as this , When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise , in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night .
In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully o ertrip the dew And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself And ran dismayed away .
In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea banks , and waft her love To come again to Carthage .
In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old Æson .
Welcome , sweet prince , to London , to your chamber .
Welcome , dear cousin , my thoughts sovereign . The weary way hath made you melancholy .
No , uncle , but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy . I want more uncles here to welcome me .
Sweet prince , the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world’s deceit Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show , which , God He knows , Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart . Those uncles which you want were dangerous . Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts . God keep you from them , and from such false friends .
I am glad of this , for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit . Therefore , as I am bound , Receive it from me . I speak not yet of proof . Look to your wife , observe her well with Cassio . Wear your eyes thus , not jealous nor secure . I would not have your free and noble nature Out of self bounty be abused . Look to ’t . I know our country disposition well . In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands . Their best conscience Is not to leave ’t undone , but keep’t unknown .
Dost thou say so
God keep me from false friends , but they were none .
My lord , the mayor of London comes to greet you .
To cart her , rather . She’s too rough for me . There , there , Hortensio , will you any wife
I pray you , sir , is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates
Mates , maid how mean you that No mates for you Unless you were of gentler , milder mold .
I faith , sir , you shall never need to fear . I wis it is not halfway to her heart . But if it were , doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool .
From all such devils , good Lord , deliver us
And me too , good Lord
Husht , master , here’s some good pastime toward . That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward .
But in the other’s silence do I see Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety . Peace , Tranio .
Tis far off , And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants . Had I not Four or five women once that tended me
Thou hadst , and more , Miranda . But how is it That this lives in thy mind What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here , How thou camest here thou mayst .
But that I do not .
Twelve year since , Miranda , twelve year since , Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power .
Sir , are not you my father
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter . And thy father Was Duke of Milan , and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued .
Oh , the heavens What foul play had we that we came from thence Or blessè was ’t we did
Both , both , my girl . By foul play , as thou sayst , were we heaved thence , But blessedly holp hither .
Yes , madam . Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say ay . And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly . Yea , quoth my husband , Fall’st upon thy face Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age . Wilt thou not , Jule It stinted and said ay .
And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .
Peace , I have done . God mark thee to his grace Thou wast the prettiest babe that e er I nursed . An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .
Marry , that marry is the very theme I came to talk of . Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married
It is an honor that I dream not of .
An honor Were not I thine only nurse , I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat .
Well , think of marriage now . Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers . By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid . Thus then in brief The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .
A man , young lady Lady , such a man As all the world . Why , he’s a man of wax .
Oh , my heart bleeds To think o th teen that I have turned you to , Which is from my remembrance Please you , farther .
My brother and thy uncle , called Antonio I pray thee , mark me he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state , as at that time Through all the signories it was the first , And Prospero the prime duke , being so reputed In dignity , and for the liberal arts Without a parallel . Those being all my study , The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger , being transported And rapt in secret studies . Thy false uncle Dost thou attend me
Sir , most heedfully .
Being once perfected how to grant suits , How to deny them , who t advance and who To trash for overtopping , new created The creatures that were mine , I say or changed em , Or else new formed em having both the key Of officer and office , set all hearts i th state To what tune pleased his ear , that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk , And sucked my verdure out on ’t . Thou attend’st not .
O , good sir , I do .
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower .
Nay , he’s a flower . In faith , a very flower .
What say you Can you love the gentleman This night you shall behold him at our feast . Read o er the volume of young Paris face And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen . Examine every married lineament And see how one another lends content , And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margin of his eyes . This precious book of love , this unbound lover , To beautify him only lacks a cover . The fish lives in the sea , and ’tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide . That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory That in gold clasps locks in the golden story . So shall you share all that he doth possess By having him , making yourself no less .
No less Nay , bigger . Women grow by men .
Speak briefly . Can you like of Paris , love
I’ll look to like if looking liking move . But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
She did deceive her father , marrying you , And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks , She loved them most .
And so she did .
Why , go to then . She that , so young , could give out such a seeming , To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak , He thought ’twas witchcraft . But I am much to blame . I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you .
I am bound to thee forever .
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits .
Not a jot , not a jot .
Trust me , I fear it has . I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love . But I do see you’re moved . I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion .
I will not .
Why , then are you no maiden . Leonato , I am sorry you must hear . Upon mine honor , Myself , my brother , and this grievèd count Did see her , hear her , at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed , most like a liberal villain , Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret .
Should you do so , my lord , My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at . Cassio’s my worthy friend My lord , I see you’re moved .
Fie , fie , they are not to be named , my lord , Not to be spoke of There is not chastity enough in language , Without offense , to utter them . Thus , pretty lady , I am sorry for thy much misgovernment .
O Hero , what a Hero hadst thou been If half thy outward graces had been placed About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart But fare thee well , most foul , most fair Farewell , Thou pure impiety and impious purity . For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love , And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang , To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm , And never shall it more be gracious .
Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me
Why , how now , cousin wherefore sink you down
Come , let us go . These things , come thus to light , Smother her spirits up .
I pray thee , mark me . I , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which , but by being so retired , O erprized all popular rate , in my false brother Awaked an evil nature . And my trust , Like a good parent , did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was , which had indeed no limit , A confidence sans bound . He being thus lorded , Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact , like one Who having into truth , by telling of it , Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie he did believe He was indeed the duke , out o th substitution And executing th outward face of royalty , With all prerogative . Hence his ambition growing Dost thou hear
Your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for , he needs will be Absolute Milan . Me , poor man , my library Was dukedom large enough . Of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable , confederates So dry he was for sway wi th King of Naples To give him annual tribute , do him homage , Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbowed alas , poor Milan To most ignoble stooping .
Oh , the heavens
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
I thank you , good my lord , and thank you all . I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way . Fie , what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no
And in good time here comes the sweating lord .
Welcome , my lord . What , will our mother come
On what occasion God He knows , not I , The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary . The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace , But by his mother was perforce withheld .
In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew , And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont .
Fie , what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers Lord Cardinal , will your Grace Persuade the queen to send the duke of York Unto his princely brother presently If she deny , Lord Hastings , go with him , And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce .
In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well , Stealing her soul with many vows of faith , And ne er a true one .
My Lord of Buckingham , if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the duke of York , Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties , God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessèd sanctuary Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin .
In such a night Did pretty Jessica , like a little shrew , Slander her love , and he forgave it her .
I would outnight you , did nobody come . But , hark , I hear the footing of a man .
Who comes so fast in silence of the night
A friend .
A friend What friend Your name , I pray you , friend
Stephano is my name , and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont . She doth stray about By holy crosses , where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours .
Well said , master . Mum , and gaze your fill .
Who comes with her
Gentlemen , that I may soon make good What I have said Bianca , get you in , And let it not displease thee , good Bianca , For I will love thee ne er the less , my girl .
A pretty peat It is best Put finger in the eye , an she knew why .
Sister , content you in my discontent . Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe . My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look and practice by myself .
Hark , Tranio Thou may’st hear Minerva speak .
Signior Baptista , will you be so strange Sorry am I that our goodwill effects Bianca’s grief .
Why will you mew her up , Signior Baptista , for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue
Gentlemen , content ye . I am resolved . Go in , Bianca .
Welcome , my lord how far off lies your power
Nor near nor farther off , my gracious lord , Than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair . One day too late , I fear me , noble lord , Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth O , call back yesterday , bid time return , And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men To day , to day , unhappy day , too late , O’erthrows thy joys , friends , fortune and thy state For all the Welshmen , hearing thou wert dead . Are gone to Bolingbroke , dispersed and fled .
How doth the lady
Comfort , my liege why looks your grace so pale
Dead , I think . Help , uncle Hero , why , Hero Uncle Signor Benedick Friar
But now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face , and they are fled And , till so much blood thither come again , Have I not reason to look pale and dead All souls that will be safe fly from my side , For time hath set a blot upon my pride .
O Fate Take not away thy heavy hand Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for .
Comfort , my liege remember who you are .
How now , cousin Hero
Have comfort , lady .
Madam , the guests are come , supper served up , you called , my young lady asked for , the Nurse cursed in the pantry , and every thing in extremity . I must hence to wait . I beseech you , follow straight .
I had forgot myself am I not king Awake , thou coward majesty thou sleepest . Is not the king’s name twenty thousand names Arm , arm , my name a puny subject strikes At thy great glory . Look not to the ground , Ye favourites of a king are we not high High be our thoughts I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn . But who comes here
We follow thee . Juliet , the county stays .
Dost thou look up
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
Yea , wherefore should she not
Wherefore Why , doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood Do not live , Hero , do not ope thine eyes , For , did I think thou wouldst not quickly die , Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames , Myself would , on the rearward of reproaches , Strike at thy life . Grieved I I had but one Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame O , one too much by thee Why had I one Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates , Who , smirchèd thus , and mired with infamy , I might have said , No part of it is mine This shame derives itself from unknown loins
Mark his condition and the event . Then tell me If this might be a brother .
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother . Good wombs have borne bad sons .
Now the condition . The King of Naples , being an enemy To me inveterate , hearkens my brother’s suit , Which was that he , in lieu o th premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute , Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom , and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother . Whereon , A treacherous army levied , one midnight Fated to th purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan , and , i th dead of darkness , The ministers for th purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self .
Alack , for pity I , not remembering how I cried out then , Will cry it o er again . It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t .
Hear a little further And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s , without the which this story Were most impertinent .
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us
No , not much moved . I do not think but Desdemona’s honest .
Long live she so . And long live you to think so .
And yet how nature , erring from itself
Ay , there’s the point . As , to be bold with you , Not to affect many proposèd matches Of her own clime , complexion , and degree , Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank , Foul disproportions , thoughts unnatural . But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her , though I may fear Her will , recoiling to her better judgment , May fall to match you with her country forms , And happily repent .
Farewell , farewell . If more thou dost perceive , let me know more . Set on thy wife to observe . Leave me , Iago .
My lord , I take my leave .
Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more , much more , than he unfolds .
My lord , I would I might entreat your honor To scan this thing no farther . Leave it to time . Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place , For sure , he fills it up with great ability , Yet , if you please to hold him off awhile , You shall by that perceive him and his means . Note if your lady strain his entertainment
You are too senseless obstinate , my lord , Too ceremonious and traditional . Weigh it but with the grossness of this age , You break not sanctuary in seizing him . The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place And those who have the wit to claim the place . This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore , in mine opinion , cannot have it . Then taking him from thence that is not there , You break no privilege nor charter there . Oft have I heard of sanctuary men , But sanctuary children , ne er till now .
My lord , you shall o errule my mind for once . Come on , Lord Hastings , will you go with me
I go , my lord .
And for I know she taketh most delight In music , instruments , and poetry , Schoolmasters will I keep within my house , Fit to instruct her youth . If you , Hortensio , Or , Signior Gremio , you know any such , Prefer them hither , for to cunning men I will be very kind , and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up . And so farewell . Katherina , you may stay , For I have more to commune with Bianca .
Good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
Why , and I trust I may go too , may I not What , shall I be appointed hours as though , belike , I knew not what to take and what to leave , ha
You may go to the devil’s dam Your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you . Their love is not so great , Hortensio , but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out . Our cake’s dough on both sides . Farewell . Yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca , if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights , I will wish him to her father .
So will I , Signior Gremio . But a word , I pray . Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love , to labor and effect one thing specially .
Say , uncle Gloucester , if our brother come , Where shall we sojourn till our coronation
Where it seems best unto your royal self . If I may counsel you , some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation .
I do not like the Tower , of any place . Did Julius Caesar build that place , my lord
None but a holy hermit and her maid . I pray you , is my master yet returned
He is not , nor we have not heard from him . But go we in , I pray thee , Jessica , And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house .
Sola , sola Wo , ha , ho Sola , sola
Who calls
Sola Did you see Master Lorenzo Master Lorenzo , sola , sola
Leave holloaing , man . Here .
Sola Where , where
Here .
Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news . My master will be here ere morning .
Sweet soul , let’s in , and there expect their coming . And yet no matter . Why should we go in My friend Stephano , signify , I pray you , Within the house , your mistress is at hand . And bring your music forth into the air .
Well demanded , wench . My tale provokes that question . Dear , they durst not , So dear the love my people bore me , nor set A mark so bloody on the business , but With colors fairer painted their foul ends . In few , they hurried us aboard a bark , Bore us some leagues to sea , where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt , not rigged , Nor tackle , sail , nor mast . The very rats Instinctively had quit it . There they hoist us To cry to th sea that roared to us , to sigh To th winds whose pity , sighing back again , Did us but loving wrong .
Alack , what trouble Was I then to you
Oh , a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me . Thou didst smile Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven , When I have decked the sea with drops full salt , Under my burthen groaned which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue .
How came we ashore
What’s that , I pray
Marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister .
A husband A devil
I say a husband .
I say a devil . Think’st thou , Hortensio , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell
Tush , Gremio . Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough .
I cannot tell . But I had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipped at the high cross every morning .
Faith , as you say , there’s small choice in rotten apples . But come , since this bar in law makes us friends , it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband , and then have to ’t afresh . Sweet Bianca Happy man be his dole He that runs fastest gets the ring . How say you , Signior Gremio
I am agreed , and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , wed her , and bed her , and rid the house of her Come on .
He did , my gracious lord , begin that place , Which , since , succeeding ages have re edified .
Is it upon record , or else reported Successively from age to age , he built it
Upon record , my gracious lord .
But say , my lord , it were not registered , Methinks the truth should live from age to age , As ’twere retailed to all posterity , Even to the general all ending day .
So wise so young , they say , do never live long .
What say you , uncle
I say , without characters fame lives long . Thus , like the formal Vice , Iniquity , I moralize two meanings in one word .
That Julius Caesar was a famous man . With what his valor did enrich his wit , His wit set down to make his valor live . Death makes no conquest of this conqueror , For now he lives in fame , though not in life . I’ll tell you what , my cousin Buckingham
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse Or shall we on without apology
The date is out of such prolixity . We’ll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf , Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath , Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper , Nor no without book prologue , faintly spoke After the prompter for our entrance . But let them measure us by what they will . We’ll measure them a measure and be gone .
Give me a torch . I am not for this ambling . Being but heavy , I will bear the light .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
I pray , sir , tell me , is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold
Not I , believe me . You have dancing shoes With nimble soles . I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move .
O Tranio , till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely . But see , while idly I stood looking on , I found the effect of love in idleness And now in plainness do confess to thee That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was , Tranio , I burn , I pine , I perish , Tranio , If I achieve not this young modest girl . Counsel me , Tranio , for I know thou canst . Assist me , Tranio , for I know thou wilt .
You are a lover . Borrow Cupid’s wings And soar with them above a common bound .
I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe . Under love’s heavy burden do I sink .
More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my care tuned tongue deliver him
Master , it is no time to chide you now . Affection is not rated from the heart . If love have touched you , naught remains but so Redime te captum quam queas minimo .
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold . Say , is my kingdom lost why , ’twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we Greater he shall not be if he serve God , We’ll serve Him too and be his fellow so Revolt our subjects that we cannot mend They break their faith to God as well as us Cry woe , destruction , ruin and decay The worst is death , and death will have his day .
Gramercies , lad , go forward . This contents . The rest will comfort , for thy counsel’s sound .
Master , you looked so longly on the maid , Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all .
Oh yes , I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had , That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand .
What , my gracious lord
An if I live until I be a man , I’ll win our ancient right in France again Or die a soldier , as I lived a king .
Short summers lightly have a forward spring .
Now in good time here comes the duke of York .
Richard of York , how fares our loving brother
Well , my dread lord so must I call you now .
Ay , brother , to our grief , as it is yours . Too late he died that might have kept that title , Which by his death hath lost much majesty .
How fares our cousin , noble Lord of York
I thank you , gentle uncle . O , my lord , You said that idle weeds are fast in growth . The prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
He hath , my lord .
And therefore is he idle
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears . Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony . Sit , Jessica . Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold . There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st But in his motion like an angel sings , Still choiring to the young eyed cherubins . Such harmony is in immortal souls , But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in , we cannot hear it .
Come ho , and wake Diana with a hymn With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear , And draw her home with music .
I am never merry when I hear sweet music .
The reason is your spirits are attentive . For do but note a wild and wanton herd , Or race of youthful and unhandled colts , Fetching mad bounds , bellowing and neighing loud , Which is the hot condition of their blood If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound , Or any air of music touch their ears , You shall perceive them make a mutual stand , Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music .
But mine , and mine I loved , and mine I praised , And mine that I was proud on , mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine , Valuing of her why , she , O she is fall n Into a pit of ink , that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again And salt too little which may season give To her foul tainted flesh
Sir , sir , be patient . For my part , I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say .
Oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied
Lady , were you her bedfellow last night
No , truly not , although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
Confirmed , confirmed Oh , that is stronger made Which was before barred up with ribs of iron Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie , Who loved her so that , speaking of her foulness , Washed it with tears Hence from her . Let her die .
Hear me a little , For I have only silent been so long , And given way unto this course of fortune , By noting of the lady . I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face , a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes , And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth . Call me a fool ,
With any strong or vehement importunity . Much will be seen in that . In the meantime , Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free , I do beseech your honor .
Fear not my government .
I once more take my leave .
This fellow’s of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities , with a learnèd spirit , Of human dealings . If I do prove her haggard , Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings , I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune . Haply , for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have , or for I am declined Into the vale of years yet that’s not much She’s gone , I am abused , and my relief Must be to loathe her . Oh , curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others uses . Yet ’tis the plague to great ones , Prerogatived are they less than the base . Tis destiny unshunnable , like death . Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us When we do quicken . Look where she comes .
If she be false , heaven mocked itself . I’ll not believe ’t .
Glad am I that your highness is so arm’d To bear the tidings of calamity . Like an unseasonable stormy day , Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores , As if the world were all dissolved to tears , So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke , covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel . White beards have arm’d their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys , with women’s voices , Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of double fatal yew against thy state Yea , distaff women manage rusty bills Against thy seat both young and old rebel , And all goes worse than I have power to tell .
By providence divine . Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan , Gonzalo , Out of his charity , who being then appointed Master of this design , did give us , with Rich garments , linens , stuffs , and necessaries , Which since have steaded much . So , of his gentleness , Knowing I loved my books , he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom .
Would I might But ever see that man
Now I arise . Sit still , and hear the last of our sea sorrow . Here in this island we arrived , and here Have I , thy schoolmaster , made thee more profit Than other princesses can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful .
Heavens thank you for ’t And now , I pray you , sir For still ’tis beating in my mind your reason For raising this sea storm
Know thus far forth By accident most strange , bountiful Fortune hath mine enemies Brought to this shore . And by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star , whose influence If now I court not but omit , my fortunes Will ever after droop . Here cease more questions .
O , my fair cousin , I must not say so .
Then is he more beholding to you than I .
He may command me as my sovereign , But you have power in me as in a kinsman .
I pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
My dagger , little cousin With all my heart .
A beggar , brother
Of my kind uncle , that I know will give , And being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin .
A greater gift O , that’s the sword to it .
Ay , gentle cousin , were it light enough .
O , then I see you will part but with light gifts . In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay .
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear .
I weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
What , would you have my weapon , little lord
I would , that I might thank you as you call me .
How
Therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees , stones , and floods Since naught so stockish , hard , and full of rage , But music for the time doth change his nature . The man that hath no music in himself , Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds , Is fit for treasons , stratagems , and spoils . The motions of his spirit are dull as night , And his affections dark as Erebus . Let no such man be trusted . Mark the music .
That light we see is burning in my hall . How far that little candle throws his beams So shines a good deed in a naughty world .
When the moon shone we did not see the candle .
So doth the greater glory dim the less . A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by , and then his state Empties itself , as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters . Music , hark .
It is your music , madam , of the house .
Nothing is good , I see , without respect . Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day .
Silence bestows that virtue on it , madam .
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended , and I think The nightingale , if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling , would be thought No better a musician than the wren . How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection Peace How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked .
Saw you no more Marked you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din
Tranio , I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air . Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her .
Nay , then , ’tis time to stir him from his trance . I pray , awake , sir If you love the maid , Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her . Thus it stands Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd That till the father rid his hands of her , Master , your love must live a maid at home , And therefore has he closely mewed her up , Because she will not be annoyed with suitors .
Ah , Tranio , what a cruel father’s he But art thou not advised , he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
Ay , marry , am I , sir and now ’tis plotted
I have it , Tranio
Master , for my hand , Both our inventions meet and jump in one .
Tell me thine first .
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid That’s your device .
It is . May it be done
How now , my dear Othello Your dinner , and the generous islanders By you invited , do attend your presence .
Thou art inclined to sleep . Tis a good dullness , And give it way . I know thou canst not choose .
I am to blame .
Come away , servant , come . I am ready now . Approach , my Ariel , come .
Why do you speak so faintly Are you not well
I have a pain upon my forehead , here .
All hail , great master Grave sir , hail I come To answer thy best pleasure , be ’t to fly , To swim , to dive into the fire , to ride On the curled clouds . To thy strong bidding , task Ariel and all his quality .
Why that’s with watching , ’twill away again . Let me but bind it hard , within this hour It will be well .
Hast thou , spirit , Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee
Your napkin is too little , Let it alone .
To every article . I boarded the king’s ship . Now on the beak , Now in the waist , the deck , in every cabin , I flamed amazement . Sometime I’d divide , And burn in many places . On the topmast , The yards , and bowsprit would I flame distinctly , Then meet and join . Jove’s lightning , the precursors O th dreadful thunderclaps , more momentary And sight outrunning were not . The fire and cracks Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble , Yea , his dread trident shake .
Come , I’ll go in with you .
I am very sorry that you are not well .
My brave spirit Who was so firm , so constant , that this coil Would not infect his reason
And to sink in it , should you burthen love Too great oppression for a tender thing .
Is love a tender thing It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
Little .
My lord of York will still be cross in talk . Uncle , your Grace knows how to bear with him .
You mean , to bear me , not to bear with me . Uncle , my brother mocks both you and me . Because that I am little , like an ape , He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders .
I am glad I have found this napkin , This was her first remembrance from the Moor . My wayward husband hath a hundred times
With what a sharp provided wit he reasons To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle , He prettily and aptly taunts himself . So cunning and so young is wonderful .
That is the voice , Or I am much deceived , of Portia .
My lord , will ’t please you pass along Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother , to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you .
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By the bad voice .
What , will you go unto the Tower , my lord
Dear lady , welcome home .
My lord protector needs will have it so .
We have been praying for our husbands welfare , Which speed , we hope , the better for our words . Are they returned
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower .
Madam , they are not yet , But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming .
Why , what should you fear
Go in , Nerissa . Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence . Nor you , Lorenzo . Jessica , nor you .
Marry , my uncle Clarence angry ghost . My grandam told me he was murdered there .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love . Prick love for pricking , and you beat love down . Give me a case to put my visage in A visor for a visor . What care I What curious eye doth cote deformities Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me .
Come , knock and enter . And no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs .
A torch for me . Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels . For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase , I’ll be a candle holder , and look on . The game was ne er so fair , and I am done .
Tut , dun’s the mouse , the constable’s own word . If thou art dun , we’ll draw thee from the mire , Or save your reverence love , wherein thou stick’st Up to the ears . Come , we burn daylight , ho
Nay , that’s not so .
I mean , sir , in delay . We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day . Take our good meaning , for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our fine wits .
Too well , too well thou tell’st a tale so ill . Where is the Earl of Wiltshire where is Bagot What is become of Bushy where is Green That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps If we prevail , their heads shall pay for it I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke .
Peace have they made with him indeed , my lord .
O villains , vipers , damn’d without redemption Dogs , easily won to fawn on any man Snakes , in my heart blood warm’d , that sting my heart Three Judases , each one thrice worse than Judas Would they make peace terrible hell make war Upon their spotted souls for this offence
Sweet love , I see , changing his property , Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate Again uncurse their souls their peace is made With heads , and not with hands those whom you curse Have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound And lie full low , graved in the hollow ground .
Is Bushy , Green , and the Earl of Wiltshire dead
Ay , all of them at Bristol lost their heads .
Where is the duke my father with his power
I fear no uncles dead .
Nor none that live , I hope .
An if they live , I hope I need not fear . But come , my lord . With a heavy heart , Thinking on them , go I unto the Tower .
Your husband is at hand . I hear his trumpet . We are no tell tales , madam . Fear you not .
Think you , my lord , this little prating York Was not incensèd by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
This night methinks is but the daylight sick . It looks a little paler . Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid .
We should hold day with the Antipodes , If you would walk in absence of the sun .
Let me give light , but let me not be light . For a light wife doth make a heavy husband , And never be Bassanio so for me . But God sort all You are welcome home , my lord .
No doubt , no doubt . O , ’tis a parlous boy , Bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable . He is all the mother’s , from the top to toe .
Well , let them rest . Come hither , Catesby . Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart . Thou knowest our reasons , urged upon the way . What thinkest thou Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the installment of this noble duke In the seat royal of this famous isle
He , for his father’s sake , so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him .
I thank you , madam . Give welcome to my friend . This is the man , this is Antonio , To whom I am so infinitely bound .
You should in all sense be much bound to him . For as I hear he was much bound for you .
No more than I am well acquitted of .
Sir , you are very welcome to our house . It must appear in other ways than words , Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy .
What think’st thou then of Stanley Will not he
He will do all in all as Hastings doth .
Trust not my reading nor my observations , Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenor of my book trust not my age , My reverence , calling , nor divinity , If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error .
Friar , it cannot be . Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury . She not denies it . Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness
Lady , what man is he you are accused of
They know that do accuse me . I know none . If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant , Let all my sins lack mercy O my father , Prove you that any man with me conversed At hours unmeet , or that I yesternight Maintained the change of words with any creature , Refuse me , hate me , torture me to death
There is some strange misprision in the princes .
Two of them have the very bent of honor , And if their wisdoms be misled in this , The practice of it lives in John the Bastard , Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies .
Not possible . For who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son , Keep house and ply his book , welcome his friends , Visit his countrymen and banquet them
Basta , content thee , for I have it full . We have not yet been seen in any house , Nor can we be distinguished by our faces For man or master . Then it follows thus Thou shalt be master , Tranio , in my stead , Keep house and port and servants as I should . I will some other be , some Florentine , Some Neapolitan , or meaner man of Pisa . Tis hatched , and shall be so . Tranio , at once Uncase thee . Take my colored hat and cloak .
When Biondello comes , he waits on thee , But I will charm him first to keep his tongue .
Where have I been Nay , how now , where are you Master , has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes Or you stolen his Or both Pray , what’s the news
Sirrah , come hither ’tis no time to jest , And therefore frame your manners to the time . Your fellow Tranio here , to save my life , Puts my apparel and my countenance on , And I for my escape have put on his For in a quarrel since I came ashore I killed a man and fear I was descried . Wait you on him , I charge you , as becomes , While I make way from hence to save my life . You understand me
Aye , sir . Ne er a whit .
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth . Tranio is changed into Lucentio .
The better for him . Would I were so too .
So could I , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter . But , sirrah , not for my sake , but your master’s , I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies . When I am alone , why then I am Tranio But in all places else , your master Lucentio .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But ’tis no wit to go .
Why , may one ask
I dreamt a dream tonight .
And so did I .
Well , what was yours
That dreamers often lie .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .
Queen Mab , what’s she
She is the fairies midwife , and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman , Drawn with a team of little atomi Over men’s noses as they lie asleep . Her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs , The cover of the wings of grasshoppers , Her traces of the smallest spider’s web , Her collars of the moonshine’s watery beams , Her whip of cricket’s bone , the lash of film , Her wagoner a small gray coated gnat , Not half so big as a round little worm Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid .
Wooed me to steal it , but she so loves the token That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to . I’ll have the work ta en out And give ’t Iago . What he will do with it Heaven knows , not I . I nothing but to please his fantasy .
How now What do you here alone
Do not you chide . I have a thing for you .
A thing for me It is a common thing
Ha
To have a foolish wife .
By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong . In faith , I gave it to the judge’s clerk . Would he were gelt that had it , for my part , Since you do take it , love , so much at heart .
Oh , is that all What will you give me now For the same handkerchief
A quarrel , ho , already What’s the matter
What handkerchief
About a hoop of gold , a paltry ring That she did give me , whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife , Love me and leave me not .
What handkerchief Why , that the Moor first gave to Desdemona , That which so often you did bid me steal .
What talk you of the posy or the value You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death , And that it should lie with you in your grave . Though not for me , yet for your vehement oaths , You should have been respective and have kept it . Gave it a judge’s clerk No , God’s my judge . The clerk will ne er wear hair on ’s face that had it .
Hast stolen it from her
He will , an if he live to be a man .
Ay , if a woman live to be a man .
No , but she let it drop by negligence And , to th advantage , I being here , took ’t up . Look , here it is .
Now , by this hand , I gave it to a youth , A kind of boy , a little scrubbèd boy No higher than thyself , the judge’s clerk , A prating boy that begged it as a fee . I could not for my heart deny it him .
You were to blame , I must be plain with you , To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift , A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh .
Well then , no more but this go , gentle Catesby , And , as it were far off , sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation . If thou dost find him tractable to us , Encourage him and show him all our reasons . If he be leaden , icy , cold , unwilling , Be thou so too , and so break off the talk , And give us notice of his inclination For we tomorrow hold divided councils , Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed .
Commend me to Lord William . Tell him , Catesby , His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret castle , And bid my lord , for joy of this good news , Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more .
Good Catesby , go effect this business soundly .
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation . All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , Then all afire with me . The king’s son , Ferdinand , With hair up staring then , like reeds , not hair Was the first man that leaped , cried , Hell is empty And all the devils are here .
My good lords both , with all the heed I can .
Why , that’s my spirit But was not this nigh shore
Shall we hear from you , Catesby , ere we sleep
Close by , my master .
You shall , my lord .
But are they , Ariel , safe
At Crosby Place , there shall you find us both .
Not a hair perished . On their sustaining garments not a blemish , But fresher than before . And , as thou badest me , In troops I have dispersed them bout the isle . The king’s son have I landed by himself , Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , His arms in this sad knot .
Now , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots
Of the king’s ship , The mariners , say how thou hast disposed , And all the rest o th fleet .
Safely in harbor Is the king’s ship . In the deep nook where once Thou called’st me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still vexed Bermoothes , there she’s hid .
No matter where of comfort no man speak Let’s talk of graves , of worms , and epitaphs Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth , Let’s choose executors and talk of wills And yet not so , for what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground Our lands , our lives and all are Bolingbroke’s , And nothing can we call our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones . For God’s sake , let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been deposed some slain in war , Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed Some poison’d by their wives some sleeping kill’d All murder’d for within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits , Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp , Allowing him a breath , a little scene , To monarchize , be fear’d and kill with looks , Infusing him with self and vain conceit , As if this flesh which walls about our life , Were brass impregnable , and humour’d thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall , and farewell king Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence throw away respect , Tradition , form and ceremonious duty , For you have but mistook me all this while I live with bread like you , feel want , Taste grief , need friends subjected thus , How can you say to me , I am a king
I know not . If they speak but truth of her , These hands shall tear her if they wrong her honor , The proudest of them shall well hear of it . Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find , awaked in such a kind , Both strength of limb and policy of mind , Ability in means and choice of friends , To quit me of them throughly .
Pause awhile , And let my counsel sway you in this case . Your daughter here the princes left for dead . Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed . Maintain a mourning ostentation , And on your family’s old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial .
What shall become of this What will this do
Marry , this , well carried , shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse . That is some good . But not for that dream I on this strange course , But on this travail look for greater birth . She , dying , as it must so be maintained , Upon the instant that she was accused , Shall be lamented , pitied and excused Of every hearer . For it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it , but being lacked and lost , Why then we rack the value , then we find
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub , Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers . And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains , and then they dream of love On courtiers knees , that dream on curtsies straight O er lawyers fingers , who straight dream on fees O er ladies lips , who straight on kisses dream , Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues , Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are . Sometime she gallops o er a courtier’s nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit . And sometime comes she with a tithe pig’s tail Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice . Sometime she driveth o er a soldier’s neck , And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , Of breaches , ambuscadoes , Spanish blades , Of healths five fathom deep , and then anon Drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes , And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again . This is that very Mab That plaits the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs , Which once untangled , much misfortune bodes . This is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , That presses them and learns them first to bear , Making them women of good carriage . This is she
Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace Thou talk’st of nothing .
True , I talk of dreams , Which are the children of an idle brain , Begot of nothing but vain fantasy , Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind , who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north , And , being angered , puffs away from thence , Turning his face to the dew dropping south .
Tranio , let’s go . One thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers . If thou ask me why , sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty .
My lord , you nod . You do not mind the play .
Yes , by Saint Anne , do I . A good matter , surely . Comes there any more of it
My lord , ’tis but begun .
Tis a very excellent piece of work , madam lady . Would ’twere done .
A good wench , give it me .
What will you do with ’t , that you have been so earnest To have me filch it
Why , what is that to you
If it be not for some purpose of import , Give ’t me again . Poor lady , she’ll run mad When she shall lack it .
Be not acknown on ’t , I have use for it . Go , leave me .
I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin And let him find it . Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ . This may do something . The Moor already changes with my poison . Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste , But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulfur .
I did say so . Look , where he comes . Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday .
Ha Ha False to me
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it . And here he stands . I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters . Now in faith , Gratiano , You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief . An ’twere to me , I should be mad at it .
Why , I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it .
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too . And then the boy , his clerk , That took some pains in writing , he begged mine . And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings .
Why , how now , general No more of that .
What ring gave you my lord Not that , I hope , which you received of me .
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it . but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it . It is gone .
Even so void is your false heart of truth . By heaven , I will ne er come in your bed Until I see the ring .
Nor I in yours Till I again see mine .
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves . Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
I fear too early , for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night’s revels , and expire the term Of a despisèd life closed in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death . But he that hath the steerage of my course , Direct my sail . On , lusty gentlemen .
Strike , drum .
The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours . So will it fare with Claudio . When he shall hear she died upon his words , The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination , And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparelled in more precious habit , More moving , delicate and full of life , Into the eye and prospect of his soul Than when she lived indeed . Then shall he mourn , If ever love had interest in his liver , And wish he had not so accused her , No , though he thought his accusation true . Let this be so , and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood . But if all aim but this be leveled false , The supposition of the lady’s death Will quench the wonder of her infamy . And if it sort not well , you may conceal her , As best befits her wounded reputation , In some reclusive and religious life , Out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .
Signior Leonato , let the friar advise you . And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio , Yet , by mine honor , I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body .
Being that I flow in grief , The smallest twine may lead me .
Sweet Portia , If you did know to whom I gave the ring , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure .
If you had known the virtue of the ring , Or half her worthiness that gave the ring , Or your own honor to contain the ring , You would not then have parted with the ring . What man is there so much unreasonable , If you had pleased to have defended it With any terms of zeal , wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony Nerissa teaches me what to believe . I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring .
Chop off his head . Something we will determine . And look when I am king , claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford , and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed .
No , by my honor , madam , by my soul , No woman had it but a civil doctor , Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And begged the ring , the which I did deny him And suffered him to go displeased away Even he that did uphold the very life Of my dear friend . What should I say , sweet lady I was enforced to send it after him . I was beset with shame and courtesy . My honor would not let ingratitude So much besmear it . Pardon me , good lady , For by these blessèd candles of the night , Had you been there I think you would have begged The ring of me to give the worthy doctor .
I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hands .
And look to have it yielded with all kindness . Come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form .
Where’s Potpan , that he helps not to take away He shift a trencher He scrape a trencher
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands , and they unwashed too , ’tis a foul thing .
Away with the joint stools , remove the court cupboard , look to the plate . Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell . Antony and Potpan
Ay , boy , ready .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
We cannot be here and there too . Cheerly , boys . Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .
Welcome , gentlemen Ladies that have their toes Ah , my mistresses Which of you all Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with you . Will now deny to dance She that makes dainty , She , I’ll swear , hath corns . Am I come near ye now Welcome , gentlemen I have seen the day That I have worn a visor and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear Such as would please . Tis gone , ’tis gone , ’tis gone . You are welcome , gentlemen . Come , musicians , play . A hall , a hall , give room And foot it , girls . More light , you knaves And turn the tables up , And quench the fire . The room is grown too hot . Ah , sirrah , this unlooked for sport comes well . Nay , sit , nay , sit , good cousin Capulet , For you and I are past our dancing days . How long is ’t now since last yourself and I Were in a mask
The mariners all under hatches stowed , Who , with a charm joined to their suffered labor , I have left asleep . And for the rest o th fleet , Which I dispersed , they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float , Bound sadly home for Naples , Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish .
Ariel , thy charge Exactly is performed . But there’s more work . What is the time o th day
Past the mid season .
Tis well consented . Presently away , For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure . Come , lady , die to live . This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged . Have patience and endure .
Lady Beatrice , have you wept all this while
Yea , and I will weep a while longer .
I will not desire that .
You have no reason . I do it freely .
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
Ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
Is there any way to show such friendship
A very even way , but no such friend .
May a man do it
It is a man’s office , but not yours .
I do love nothing in the world so well as you . Is not that strange
At least two glasses . The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously .
As strange as the thing I know not . It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you , but believe me not , and yet I lie not , I confess nothing , nor I deny nothing . I am sorry for my cousin .
Is there more toil Since thou dost give me pains , Let me remember thee what thou hast promised , Which is not yet performed me .
How now Moody What is ’t thou canst demand
My liberty .
Before the time be out No more
I prithee , Remember I have done thee worthy service , Told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served Without or grudge or grumblings . Thou didst promise To bate me a full year .
Avaunt Be gone Thou hast set me on the rack . I swear ’tis better to be much abused Than but to know ’t a little .
How now , my lord
What sense had I in her stol n hours of lust I saw ’t not , thought it not , it harmed not me . I slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry . I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips . He that is robbed , not wanting what is stol n , Let him not know’t , and he’s not robbed at all .
I am sorry to hear this .
I had been happy if the general camp , Pioneers and all , had tasted her sweet body , So I had nothing known . Oh , now forever Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue Oh , farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump , The spirit stirring drum , th ear piercing fife , The royal banner , and all quality , Pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war And O you mortal engines , whose rude throats The immortal Jove’s dead clamors counterfeit , Farewell Othello’s occupation’s gone .
Is ’t possible , my lord
Villain , be sure thou prove my love a whore , Be sure of it . Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of mine eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath
My lord , wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes , But presently prevent the ways to wail . To fear the foe , since fear oppresseth strength , Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe , And so your follies fight against yourself . Fear and be slain no worse can come to fight And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breath .
Verona , for a while I take my leave , To see my friends in Padua , but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend , Hortensio . And I trow this is his house . Here , sirrah Grumio . Knock , I say .
My father hath a power inquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb .
Knock , sir Whom should I knock Is there any man has rebused your Worship
Thou chidest me well proud Bolingbroke , I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom . This ague fit of fear is over blown An easy task it is to win our own . Say , Scroop , where lies our uncle with his power Speak sweetly , man , although thy looks be sour .
Villain , I say , knock me here soundly .
Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state and inclination of the day So may you by my dull and heavy eye , My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say . I play the torturer , by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken Your uncle York is join’d with Bolingbroke , And all your northern castles yielded up , And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party .
Knock you here , sir Why , sir , what am I , sir , that I should knock you here , sir
Villain , I say , knock me at this gate And rap me well , or I’ll knock your knave’s pate .
My master is grown quarrelsome . I should knock you first , And then I know after who comes by the worst .
Will it not be Faith , sirrah , an you’ll not knock , I’ll ring it . I’ll try how you can sol , fa , and sing it .
Help , mistress , help My master is mad .
By r Lady , thirty years .
What , man , ’tis not so much , ’tis not so much . Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio , Come Pentecost as quickly as it will , Some five and twenty years , and then we masked .
Tis more , ’tis more . His son is elder , sir . His son is thirty .
Will you tell me that His son was but a ward two years ago .
What lady is that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight
I know not , sir .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope’s ear , Beauty too rich for use , for earth too dear . So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady o er her fellows shows . The measure done , I’ll watch her place of stand , And , touching hers , make blessèd my rude hand . Did my heart love till now Forswear it , sight For I ne er saw true beauty till this night .
Is ’t come to this
Make me to see ’t , or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on , or woe upon thy life
My noble lord
If thou dost slander her and torture me , Never pray more . Abandon all remorse . On horror’s head horrors accumulate , Do deeds to make heaven weep , all earth amazed , For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that .
Oh , grace Oh , heaven forgive me Are you a man Have you a soul or sense God buy you , take mine office . O wretched fool That lov’st to make thine honesty a vice O monstrous world Take note , take note , O world , To be direct and honest is not safe . I thank you for this profit , and from hence I’ll love no friend , sith love breeds such offence .
Nay , stay . Thou shouldst be honest .
I should be wise , for honesty’s a fool And loses that it works for .
By my sword , Beatrice , thou lovest me .
Do not swear , and eat it .
By the world , I think my wife be honest and think she is not . I think that thou art just and think thou art not . I’ll have some proof . Her name , that was as fresh As Dian’s visage , is now begrimed and black As mine own face . If there be cords or knives , Poison , or fire , or suffocating streams , I’ll not endure it . Would I were satisfied
I will swear by it that you love me , and I will make him eat it that says I love not you .
Will you not eat your word
With no sauce that can be devised to it . I protest I love thee .
Why then , God forgive me .
What offense , sweet Beatrice
You have stayed me in a happy hour . I was about to protest I loved you .
And do it with all thy heart .
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
Come , bid me do anything for thee .
Kill Claudio .
Ha Not for the wide world .
Let not that doctor e er come near my house Since he hath got the jewel that I loved , And that which you did swear to keep for me , I will become as liberal as you . I’ll not deny him anything I have , No , not my body , nor my husband’s bed . Know him I shall , I am well sure of it . Lie not a night from home . Watch me like Argus . If you do not , if I be left alone , Now , by mine honor which is yet mine own I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow .
And I his clerk . Therefore be well advised How you do leave me to mine own protection .
Well , do you so , let not me take him then . For if I do I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen .
I am th unhappy subject of these quarrels .
Sir , grieve not you . You are welcome notwithstanding .
Portia , forgive me this enforcèd wrong , And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself
Mark you but that In both my eyes he doubly sees himself In each eye , one . Swear by your double self , And there’s an oath of credit
You kill me to deny it . Farewell .
My lord , my lord .
Who knocks
One from the Lord Stanley .
What is ‘t o’clock
Upon the stroke of four .
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights
So it appears by that I have to say . First , he commends him to your noble self .
What then
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razèd his helm Besides , he says there are two councils kept , And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th other . Therefore he sends to know your Lordship’s pleasure , If you will presently take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north To shun the danger that his soul divines .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague . Fetch me my rapier , boy . What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity Now , by the stock and honor of my kin , To strike him dead I hold it not a sin .
Why , how now , kinsman Wherefore storm you so
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .
Young Romeo is it
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
Content thee , gentle coz . Let him alone . He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well governed youth . I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement . Therefore be patient . Take no note of him . It is my will , the which if thou respect , Show a fair presence and put off these frowns , An ill beseeming semblance for a feast .
Now knock when I bid you , sirrah villain .
How now , what’s the matter My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio How do you all at Verona
Signior Hortensio , come you to part the fray Con tutto il cuore , ben trovato , may I say .
Alla nostra casa ben venuto , molto honorato signor mio Petruchio . Rise , Grumio , rise . We will compound this quarrel .
Nay , ’tis no matter , sir , what he leges in Latin . If this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service look you , sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly , sir . Well , was it fit for a servant to use his master so , being perhaps , for aught I see , two and thirty , a pip out Whom , would to God , I had well knocked at first , Then had not Grumio come by the worst .
A senseless villain , good Hortensio . I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it .
Knock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these words plain Sirrah , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly And come you now with knocking at the gate
Sirrah , begone or talk not , I advise you .
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee
No .
Thou dost , and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep , To run upon the sharp wind of the north , To do me business in the veins o th earth When it is baked with frost .
I do not , sir .
Thou liest , malignant thing Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax , who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop Hast thou forgot her
No , sir .
Thou hast . Where was she born Speak . Tell me .
Sir , in Argier .
Oh , was she so I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been , Which thou forget’st . This damned witch Sycorax , For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing , from Argier , Thou know’st , was banished . For one thing she did They would not take her life . Is not this true
Ay , sir .
Thou hast said enough .
Beshrew thee , cousin , which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair What say you now what comfort have we now By heaven , I’ll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more . Go to Flint castle there I’ll pine away A king , woe’s slave , shall kingly woe obey . That power I have , discharge and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow , For I have none let no man speak again To alter this , for counsel is but vain .
My liege , one word .
He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue . Discharge my followers let them hence away , From Richard’s night to Bolingbroke’s fair day .
Petruchio , patience . I am Grumio’s pledge . Why , this a heavy chance ’twixt him and you , Your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant Grumio . And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home , Where small experience grows . But in a few , Signior Hortensio , thus it stands with me Antonio , my father , is deceased , And I have thrust myself into this maze , Happily to wive and thrive as best I may . Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home , And so am come abroad to see the world .
Petruchio , shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd , ill favored wife Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich , And very rich . But thou rt too much my friend , And I’ll not wish thee to her .
Signior Hortensio , ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice . And therefore , if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife , As wealth is burden of my wooing dance , Be she as foul as was Florentius love , As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd As Socrates Xanthippe , or a worse , She moves me not , or not removes at least Affection’s edge in me , were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas . I come to wive it wealthily in Padua If wealthily , then happily in Padua .
I see , sir , you are eaten up with passion . I do repent me that I put it to you . You would be satisfied
Would Nay , and I will .
And may , but how How satisfied , my lord Would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , Behold her topped
Death and damnation Oh
It were a tedious difficulty , I think , To bring them to that prospect . Damn them then , If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own What then How then What shall I say Where’s satisfaction It is impossible you should see this , Were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , As salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk . But yet , I say , If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction , you may have ’t .
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal .
I do not like the office . But , sith I am entered in this cause so far , Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love , I will go on . I lay with Cassio lately And , being troubled with a raging tooth , I could not sleep . There are a kind of men So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter
Nay , but hear me . Pardon this fault , and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee .
I once did lend my body for his wealth , Which but for him that had your husband’s ring Had quite miscarried . I dare be bound again , My soul upon the forfeit , that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly .
Then you shall be his surety . Give him this , And bid him keep it better than the other .
Here , Lord Bassanio . Swear to keep this ring .
By heaven , it is the same I gave the doctor
I had it of him . Pardon me , Bassanio , For by this ring , the doctor lay with me .
And pardon me , my gentle Gratiano , For that same scrubbèd boy , the doctor’s clerk , In lieu of this , last night did lie with me .
Tarry , sweet Beatrice .
Why , this is like the mending of highways In summer where the ways are fair enough What , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
I am gone , though I am here . There is no love in you . Nay , I pray you let me go .
Go , fellow , go . Return unto thy lord . Bid him not fear the separated council . His Honor and myself are at the one , And at the other is my good friend Catesby , Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence . Tell him his fears are shallow , without instance . And for his dreams , I wonder he’s so simple To trust the mock ry of unquiet slumbers . To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase . Go , bid thy master rise and come to me , And we will both together to the Tower , Where he shall see , the boar will use us kindly .
I’ll go , my lord , and tell him what you say .
Many good morrows to my noble lord .
Good morrow , Catesby . You are early stirring . What news , what news in this our tott ring state
It is a reeling world indeed , my lord , And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm .
How wear the garland Dost thou mean the crown
So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispersed , and Salisbury Is gone to meet the king , who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coast .
The news is very fair and good , my lord Richard not far from hence hath hid his head .
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say ‘King Richard ’ alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his head .
Your grace mistakes only to be brief Left I his title out .
The time hath been , Would you have been so brief with him , he would Have been so brief with you , to shorten you , For taking so the head , your whole head’s length .
Mistake not , uncle , further than you should .
Take not , good cousin , further than you should . Lest you mistake the heavens are o’er our heads .
I know it , uncle , and oppose not myself Against their will . But who comes here
It fits when such a villain is a guest . I’ll not endure him .
He shall be endured . What , goodman boy I say , he shall . Go to . Am I the master here , or you Go to . You’ll not endure him God shall mend my soul , You’ll make a mutiny among my guests . You will set cock a hoop . You’ll be the man
Beatrice
Why , uncle , ’tis a shame .
In faith , I will go .
Go to , go to . You are a saucy boy . Is ’t so , indeed This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what . You must contrary me . Marry , ’tis time . Well said , my hearts You are a princox , go . Be quiet , or More light , more light For shame I’ll make you quiet . What , cheerly , my hearts
Patience perforce with willful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting . I will withdraw , but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet , convert to bitterest gall .
We’ll be friends first .
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
Is Claudio thine enemy
Is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman Oh , that I were a man What , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancor O God , that I were a man I would eat his heart in the marketplace .
Hear me , Beatrice
Talk with a man out at a window A proper saying
Nay , but Beatrice
Sweet Hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
Beat
Their affairs . One of this kind is Cassio . In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona , Let us be wary , let us hide our loves . And then , sir , would he gripe and wring my hand , Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard , As if he plucked up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips , lay his leg Over my thigh , and sigh , and kiss , and then Cry Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor
Oh , monstrous Monstrous
Nay , this was but his dream .
This blue eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th sailors . Thou , my slave , As thou report’st thyself , wast then her servant . And , for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands , Refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage , Into a cloven pine , within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years within which space she died And left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike . Then was this island Save for the son that she did litter here , A freckled whelp hag born not honored with A human shape .
But this denoted a foregone conclusion .
Yes , Caliban , her son .
Tis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream . And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly .
I’ll tear her all to pieces
Dull thing , I say so . He , that Caliban Whom now I keep in service . Thou best know’st What torment I did find thee in . Thy groans Of ever angry bears . It was a torment Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts To lay upon the damned , which Sycorax Could not again undo . It was mine art , When I arrived and heard thee , that made gape The pine and let thee out .
Nay , yet be wise , yet we see nothing done , She may be honest yet . Tell me but this , Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand
I thank thee , master .
I gave her such a one , ’twas my first gift .
If thou more murmur’st , I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters .
I know not that , but such a handkerchief I am sure it was your wife’s did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with .
If it be that
If it be that , or any that was hers , It speaks against her with the other proofs .
Nay , look you , sir , he tells you flatly what his mind is . Why , give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet baby , or an old trot with ne er a tooth in her head , though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses . Why , nothing comes amiss , so money comes withal .
Petruchio , since we are stepped thus far in , I will continue that I broached in jest . I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous , Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman . Her only fault , and that is faults enough , Is that she is intolerable curst , And shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure That , were my state far worser than it is , I would not wed her for a mine of gold .
Hortensio , peace . Thou know’st not gold’s effect . Tell me her father’s name , and ’tis enough For I will board her , though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack .
Her father is Baptista Minola , An affable and courteous gentleman . Her name is Katherina Minola , Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue .
I know her father , though I know not her , And he knew my deceasèd father well . I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her , And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither .
Speak not so grossly . You are all amazed . Unseal this letter soon . There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbor suddenly . You shall not know by what strange accident I chancèd on this letter .
I am dumb .
Were you the doctor and I knew you not
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
Ay , but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man .
Sweet doctor , you shall be my bedfellow . When I am absent then lie with my wife .
Sweet lady , you have given me life and living . For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road .
Ay , my good lord .
I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced . But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
Ay , on my life , and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof And thereupon he sends you this good news , That this same very day your enemies , The kindred of the queen , must die at Pomfret .
Indeed , I am no mourner for that news , Because they have been still my adversaries . But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side To bar my master’s heirs in true descent , God knows I will not do it , to the death .
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind .
But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence , That they which brought me in my master’s hate , I live to look upon their tragedy . Well , Catesby , ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t .
Tis a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , When men are unprepared and look not for it .
O monstrous , monstrous And so falls it out With Rivers , Vaughan , Grey and so ’twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I , who , as thou know’st , are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham .
Pardon , master . I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently .
Do so , and after two days I will discharge thee .
That’s my noble master What shall I do Say , what What shall I do
Go make thyself like a nymph o th sea . Be subject To no sight but thine and mine , invisible To every eyeball else . Go take this shape And hither come in ’t . Go hence with diligence .
Awake , dear heart , awake Thou hast slept well . Awake
The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me .
Shake it off . Come on . We’ll visit Caliban , my slave who never Yields us kind answer .
Tis a villain , sir , I do not love to look on .
How now , Lorenzo My clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
Ay , and I’ll give them him without a fee . There do I give to you and Jessica , From the rich Jew , a special deed of gift , After his death of all he dies possessed of .
Fair ladies , you drop manna in the way Of starvèd people .
It is almost morning , And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full . Let us go in , And charge us there upon interr gatories , And we will answer all things faithfully .
I pray you , sir , let him go while the humor lasts . O my word , an she knew him as well as I do , she would think scolding would do little good upon him . She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so . Why , that’s nothing an he begin once , he’ll rail in his rope tricks . I’ll tell you what sir an she stand him but a little , he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat . You know him not , sir .
Oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives One is too poor , too weak for my revenge . Now do I see ’tis true . Look here , Iago , All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven . Tis gone . Arise , black vengeance , from the hollow hell Yield up , O love , thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate Swell , bosom , with thy fraught , For ’tis of aspics tongues
Let it be so . The first interr gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay , Or go to bed now , being two hours to day . But were the day come , I should wish it dark , That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk . Well , while I live I’ll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring .
Tarry , Petruchio , I must go with thee , For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is . He hath the jewel of my life in hold , His youngest daughter , beautiful Bianca , And her withholds from me and other more , Suitors to her and rivals in my love , Supposing it a thing impossible , For those defects I have before rehearsed , That ever Katherina will be wooed . Therefore this order hath Baptista ta en , That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katherine the curst have got a husband .
Yet be content .
Oh , blood , blood , blood
Patience , I say . Your mind may change .
Never , Iago . Like to the Pontic sea , Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne er keeps retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont , Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall ne er look back , ne er ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up . Now , by yon marble heaven , In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words .
Do not rise yet . Witness , you ever burning lights above , You elements that clip us round about , Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit , hands , heart , To wronged Othello’s service . Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody business ever .
Katherine the curst A title for a maid of all titles the worst .
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace , And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music , to instruct Bianca , That so I may , by this device at least , Have leave and leisure to make love to her And , unsuspected , court her by herself .
The princes both make high account of you For they account his head upon the Bridge .
I know they do , and I have well deserved it .
Come on , come on . Where is your boar spear , man Fear you the boar , and go so unprovided
My lord , good morrow . Good morrow , Catesby . You may jest on , but , by the Holy Rood , I do not like these several councils , I .
My lord , I hold my life as dear as you do yours , And never in my days , I do protest , Was it so precious to me as ’tis now . Think you but that I know our state secure , I would be so triumphant as I am
The lords at Pomfret , when they rode from London , Were jocund and supposed their states were sure , And they indeed had no cause to mistrust But yet you see how soon the day o ercast . This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt . Pray God , I say , I prove a needless coward What , shall we toward the Tower The day is spent .
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine , the gentle sin is this My lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
Good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , Which mannerly devotion shows in this , For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch , And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss .
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do . They pray grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers sake .
Then move not , while my prayer’s effect I take .
Kisses her
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Sin from thy lips O trespass sweetly urged Give me my sin again .
But as ’tis , We cannot miss him . He does make our fire , Fetch in our wood , and serves in offices That profit us . What , ho Slave Caliban Thou earth , thou Speak .
Princes and counties Surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , Count Comfect , a sweet gallant , surely Oh , that I were a man for his sake Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake But manhood is melted into curtsies , valor into compliment , and men are only turned into tongue , and trim ones too . He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it . I cannot be a man with wishing , therefore I will die a woman with grieving .
Tarry , good Beatrice . By this hand , I love thee .
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
There’s wood enough within .
Come forth , I say There’s other business for thee . Come , thou tortoise When
Fine apparition My quaint Ariel , Hark in thine ear .
My lord it shall be done .
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero
Yea , as sure as I have a thought or a soul .
Thou poisonous slave , got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam , come forth
Enough , I am engaged . I will challenge him . I will kiss your hand , and so I leave you . By this hand , Claudio shall render me a dear account . As you hear of me , so think of me . Go comfort your cousin . I must say she is dead , and so , farewell .
As wicked dew as e er my mother brushed With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o er
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , And will upon the instant put thee to ’t . Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive .
My friend is dead , Tis done at your request . But let her live .
Damn her , lewd minx Oh , damn her , damn her Come , go with me apart . I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil . Now art thou my lieutenant .
I am your own for ever .
Come , come . Have with you . Wot you what , my lord Today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
They , for their truth , might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats . But come , my lord , let’s away .
Go on before . I’ll talk with this good fellow .
How now , sirrah How goes the world with thee
The better that your Lordship please to ask .
I tell thee , man , ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet . Then was I going prisoner to the TowerBy the suggestion of the queen’s allies . But now , I tell thee keep it to thyself This day those enemies are put to death , And I in better state than e er I was .
God hold it , to your Honor’s good content
Gramercy , fellow . There , drink that for me .
I thank your Honor .
Welcome , Harry what , will not this castle yield
The castle royally is mann’d , my lord , Against thy entrance .
Royally Why , it contains no king
Yes , my good lord , It doth contain a king King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone And with him are the Lord Aumerle , Lord Salisbury , Sir Stephen Scroop , besides a clergyman Of holy reverence who , I cannot learn .
O , belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle .
Noble lords , Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley Into his ruin’d ears , and thus deliver Henry Bolingbroke On both his knees doth kiss King Richard’s hand And sends allegiance and true faith of heart To his most royal person , hither come Even at his feet to lay my arms and power , Provided that my banishment repeal’d And lands restored again be freely granted If not , I’ll use the advantage of my power And lay the summer’s dust with showers of blood Rain’d from the wounds of slaughter’d Englishmen The which , how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke It is , such crimson tempest should bedrench The fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land , My stooping duty tenderly shall show . Go , signify as much , while here we march Upon the grassy carpet of this plain . Let’s march without the noise of threatening drum , That from this castle’s tatter’d battlements Our fair appointments may be well perused . Methinks King Richard and myself should meet With no less terror than the elements Of fire and water , when their thundering shock At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven . Be he the fire , I’ll be the yielding water The rage be his , whilst on the earth I rain My waters on the earth , and not on him . March on , and mark King Richard how he looks .
Here’s no knavery See , to beguile the old folks , how the young folks lay their heads together
Master , master , look about you . Who goes there , ha
Peace , Grumio . It is the rival of my love . Petruchio , stand by a while .
A proper stripling , and an amorous .
O , very well , I have perused the note . Hark you , sir I’ll have them very fairly bound , All books of love . See that at any hand , And see you read no other lectures to her . You understand me . Over and beside Signior Baptista’s liberality , I’ll mend it with a largess . Take your paper too . And let me have them very well perfum’d For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to . What will you read to her
Whate er I read to her , I’ll plead for you As for my patron , stand you so assured , As firmly as yourself were still in place , Yea , and perhaps with more successful words Than you , unless you were a scholar , sir .
O this learning , what a thing it is
Well met , my lord . I am glad to see your Honor .
I thank thee , good Sir John , with all my heart . I am in your debt for your last exercise . Come the next sabbath , and I will content you .
I’ll wait upon your Lordship
Do you know , sirrah , where Lieutenant Cassio lies
I dare not say he lies anywhere .
Why , man
What , talking with a priest , Lord Chamberlain Your friends at Pomfret , they do need the priest Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand .
He’s a soldier , and for one to say a soldier lies , ’tis stabbing .
Good faith , and when I met this holy man , The men you talk of came into my mind . What , go you toward the Tower
Go to . Where lodges he
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie .
I do , my lord , but long I shall not stay there . I shall return before your Lordship thence .
Nay , like enough , for I stay dinner there .
Can anything be made of this
I know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here , or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .
And supper too , although thou know’st it not . Come , will you go
I’ll wait upon your Lordship .
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report
I will catechize the world for him , that is , make questions , and by them answer .
Seek him , bid him come hither . Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
To do this is within the compass of man’s wit , and therefore I will attempt the doing it .
You kiss by th book .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
What is her mother
Marry , bachelor , Her mother is the lady of the house , And a good lady , and a wise and virtuous . I nursed her daughter that you talked withal . I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
Is she a Capulet O dear account My life is my foe’s debt .
Away , begone . The sport is at the best .
Ay , so I fear . The more is my unrest .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone . We have a trifling foolish banquet towards . Is it e en so Why , then , I thank you all . I thank you , honest gentlemen . Good night . More torches here Come on then , let’s to bed . Ah , sirrah , by my fay , it waxes late . I’ll to my rest .
O this woodcock , what an ass it is
Peace , sirrah
Grumio , mum God save you , Signior Gremio .
And you are well met , Signior Hortensio . Trow you whither I am going To Baptista Minola . I promised to enquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca , And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man , for learning and behavior Fit for her turn , well read in poetry And other books good ones , I warrant ye .
Tis well . And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another , A fine musician to instruct our mistress . So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca , so beloved of me .
Beloved of me , and that my deeds shall prove .
And that his bags shall prove .
Gremio , ’tis now no time to vent our love . Listen to me , and if you speak me fair , I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either .
For this , be sure , tonight thou shalt have cramps , Side stitches that shall pen thy breath up . Urchins Shall , forth at vast of night that they may work , All exercise on thee . Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging Than bees that made em .
I must eat my dinner . This island’s mine , by Sycorax my mother , Which thou takest from me . When thou camest first , Thou strok’st me and made much of me , wouldst give me Water with berries in ’t , and teach me how To name the bigger light , and how the less , That burn by day and night . And then I loved thee And showed thee all the qualities o th isle , The fresh springs , brine pits , barren place and fertile . Cursed be I that did so All the charms Of Sycorax , toads , beetles , bats , light on you For I am all the subjects that you have , Which first was mine own king . And here you sty me In this hard rock , whiles you do keep from me The rest o th island .
Thou most lying slave , Whom stripes may move , not kindness I have used thee , Filth as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child .
Oh ho , oh ho Would ’t had been done Thou didst prevent me . I had peopled else This isle with Calibans .
Is our whole dissembly appeared
Oh , a stool and a cushion for the Sexton .
Which be the malefactors
Marry , that am I and my partner .
Nay , that’s certain we have the exhibition to examine .
But which are the offenders that are to be examined Let them come before Master Constable .
Yea , marry , let them come before me . What is your name , friend
What’s your name , friend
Borachio .
Pray , write down , Borachio . Yours , sirrah
I am a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
If music be the food of love , play on . Give me excess of it that , surfeiting , The appetite may sicken , and so die . That strain again , it had a dying fall . Oh , it came o er my ear like the sweet sound , That breathes upon a bank of violets , Stealing and giving odor . Enough , no more . Tis not so sweet now as it was before . O spirit of love , how quick and fresh art thou , That , notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea , nought enters there , Of what validity and pitch soe er , But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute . So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical .
Will you go hunt , my lord
What , Curio
The hart .
Why , so I do , the noblest that I have . Oh , when mine eyes did see Olivia first , Methought she purged the air of pestilence . That instant was I turned into a hart , And my desires , like fell and cruel hounds , E er since pursue me .
See , see , King Richard doth himself appear , As doth the blushing discontented sun From out the fiery portal of the east , When he perceives the envious clouds are bent To dim his glory and to stain the track Of his bright passage to the occident .
Yet looks he like a king behold , his eye , As bright as is the eagle’s , lightens forth Controlling majesty alack , alack , for woe , That any harm should stain so fair a show
We are amazed and thus long have we stood To watch the fearful bending of thy knee ,
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king And if we be , how dare thy joints forget To pay their awful duty to our presence If we be not , show us the hand of God That hath dismissed us from our stewardship For well we know , no hand of blood and bone Can grip the sacred handle of our sceptre , Unless he do profane , steal , or usurp . And though you think that all , as you have done , Have torn their souls by turning them from us , And we are barren and bereft of friends Yet know , my master , God omnipotent , Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf Armies of pestilence and they shall strike Your children yet unborn and unbegot , That lift your vassal hands against my head And threat the glory of my precious crown . Tell Bolingbroke for yond methinks he stands That every stride he makes upon my land Is dangerous treason he is come to open The purple testament of bleeding war But ere the crown he looks for live in peace , Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers’ sons Shall ill become the flower of England’s face , Change the complexion of her maid pale peace To scarlet indignation and bedew Her pastures’ grass with faithful English blood .
Abhorrèd slave , Which any print of goodness wilt not take , Being capable of all ill I pitied thee , Took pains to make thee speak , taught thee each hour One thing or other . When thou didst not , savage , Know thine own meaning , but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish , I endowed thy purposes With words that made them known . But thy vile race , Though thou didst learn , had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with . Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock , Who hadst deserved more than a prison .
You taught me language , and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse . The red plague rid you For learning me your language
Hag seed , hence Fetch us in fuel . And be quick , thou rt best , To answer other business . Shrug’st thou , malice If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly What I command , I’ll rack thee with old cramps , Fill all thy bones with aches , make thee roar That beasts shall tremble at thy din .
No , pray thee . I must obey . His art is of such power , It would control my dam’s god , Setebos , And make a vassal of him .
So , slave , hence
Sir Richard Ratcliffe , let me tell thee this Today shalt thou behold a subject die For truth , for duty , and for loyalty .
God bless the prince from all the pack of you A knot you are of damnèd bloodsuckers .
You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter .
Dispatch . The limit of your lives is out .
O Pomfret , Pomfret O thou bloody prison , Fatal and ominous to noble peers Within the guilty closure of thy walls , Richard the Second here was hacked to death , And , for more slander to thy dismal seat , We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink .
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met , Upon agreement from us to his liking , Will undertake to woo curst Katherine , Yea , and to marry her , if her dowry please .
Now Margaret’s curse is fall n upon our heads , When she exclaimed on Hastings , you , and I , For standing by when Richard stabbed her son .
So said , so done , is well . Hortensio , have you told him all her faults
Then cursed she Richard , then cursed she Buckingham . Then cursed she Hastings . O , remember , God , To hear her prayer for them , as now for us And for my sister and her princely sons , Be satisfied , dear God , with our true blood , Which , as thou know’st , unjustly must be spilt .
I know she is an irksome brawling scold . If that be all , masters , I hear no harm .
No Say’st me so , friend What countryman
Born in Verona , old Antonio’s son . My father dead , my fortune lives for me . And I do hope good days and long to see .
O sir , such a life with such a wife were strange But if you have a stomach , to ’t , i God’s name You shall have me assisting you in all . But will you woo this wildcat
Will I live
Will he woo her Ay , or I’ll hang her .
Why came I hither but to that intent Think you a little din can daunt mine ears Have I not in my time heard lions roar Have I not heard the sea , puffed up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat Have I not heard great ordnance in the field , And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies
How now What news from her
Come hither , Nurse . What is yond gentleman
So please my lord , I might not be admitted , But from her handmaid do return this answer The element itself , till seven years heat , Shall not behold her face at ample view , But like a cloistress , she will veiled walk And water once a day her chamber round With eye offending brine all this to season A brother’s dead love , which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance .
The son and heir of old Tiberio .
What’s he that now is going out of door
O , she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother , How will she love , when the rich golden shaft Hath killed the flock of all affections else That live in her , when liver , brain , and heart , These sovereign thrones , are all supplied , and filled Her sweet perfections with one self king Away before me to sweet beds of flowers . Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers .
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .
Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia
I know not , madam .
Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes . And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are , it were enough To put him to ill thinking .
Is he not jealous
Who , he I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him .
Look where he comes .
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him . How is ’t with you , my lord
Well , my good lady . Oh , hardness to dissemble How do you , Desdemona
Write down Master Gentleman Conrade . Masters , do you serve God
Yea , sir , we hope .
Write down that they hope they serve God and write God first , for God defend but God should go before such villains Masters , it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves , and it will go near to be thought so shortly . How answer you for yourselves
Marry , sir , we say we are none .
A marvelous witty fellow , I assure you , but I will go about with him . Come you hither , sirrah , a word in your ear . Sir , I say to you it is thought you are false knaves .
Sir , I say to you we are none .
Well , stand aside . Fore God , they are both in a ale . Have you writ down that they are none
Well , my good lord .
Master Constable , you go not the way to examine . You must call forth the watch that are their accusers .
Yea , marry , that’s the eftest way . Let the watch come forth . Masters , I charge you in the Prince’s name , accuse these men .
Give me your hand . This hand is moist , my lady .
What’s he that follows here , that would not dance
It hath felt no age nor known no sorrow .
I know not .
Go ask his name . If he be married . My grave is like to be my wedding bed .
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart . Hot , hot , and moist . This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty , fasting , and prayer ,
His name is Romeo , and a Montague , The only son of your great enemy .
My only love sprung from my only hate Too early seen unknown , and known too late Prodigious birth of love it is to me , That I must love a loathèd enemy .
What’s this What’s this
A rhyme I learned even now Of one I danced withal .
Anon , anon Come , let’s away . The strangers all are gone .
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rush’d upon Thy thrice noble cousin Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand And by the honourable tomb he swears , That stands upon your royal grandsire’s bones , And by the royalties of both your bloods , Currents that spring from one most gracious head , And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt , And by the worth and honour of himself , Comprising all that may be sworn or said , His coming hither hath no further scope Than for his lineal royalties and to beg Enfranchisement immediate on his knees Which on thy royal party granted once , His glittering arms he will commend to rust , His barbed steeds to stables , and his heart To faithful service of your majesty . This swears he , as he is a prince , is just And , as I am a gentleman , I credit him .
Northumberland , say thus the king returns His noble cousin is right welcome hither And all the number of his fair demands Shall be accomplish’d without contradiction With all the gracious utterance thou hast Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends . We do debase ourselves , cousin , do we not ,
Make haste . The hour of death is expiate .
Come , Grey . Come , Vaughan . Let us all embrace . They embrace Farewell until we meet in heaven .
Have I not in a pitchèd battle heard Loud larums , neighing steeds , and trumpets clang And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire Tush , tush Fear boys with bugs .
For he fears none .
Hortensio , hark . This gentleman is happily arrived , My mind presumes , for his own good and ours .
I promised we would be contributors And bear his charge of wooing , whatsoe er .
And so we will , provided that he win her .
I would I were as sure of a good dinner .
Gentlemen , God save you . If I may be bold , Tell me , I beseech you , which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola
He that has the two fair daughters is ’t he you mean
Even he , Biondello .
Hark you , sir , you mean not her to
Come unto these yellow sands , And then take hands . Curtsied when you have , and kissed The wild waves whist . Foot it featly here and there , And , sweet sprites , bear The burden . Hark , hark
Bow wow .
The watchdogs bark .
Bow wow .
Hark , hark I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry Cock a diddle dow .
Where should this music be I th air or th earth It sounds no more , and sure , it waits upon Some god o th island . Sitting on a bank , Weeping again the king my father’s wrack , This music crept by me upon the waters , Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air . Thence I have followed it , Or it hath drawn me rather . But ’tis gone . No , it begins again .
What country , friends , is this
This is Illyria , lady .
And what should I do in Illyria My brother he is in Elysium . Perchance he is not drown’d . What think you , sailors
It is perchance that you yourself were saved .
O , my poor brother And so perchance may he be .
True , madam . And , to comfort you with chance , Assure yourself , after our ship did split , When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat , I saw your brother , Most provident in peril , bind himself , Courage and hope both teaching him the practice , To a strong mast that lived upon the sea , Where , like Arion on the dolphin’s back , I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see .
For saying so , there’s gold . Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope , Whereto thy speech serves for authority , The like of him . Know’st thou this country
Ay , madam , well , for I was bred and born Not three hours travel from this very place .
Much castigation , exercise devout , For here’s a young and sweating devil here , That commonly rebels . Tis a good hand , A frank one .
You may indeed say so , For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart .
A liberal hand . The hearts of old gave hands , But our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
I cannot speak of this . Come now , your promise .
What promise , chuck
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me . Lend me thy handkerchief .
Here , my lord .
That which I gave you .
I have it not about me .
Not
No , indeed , my lord .
That’s a fault . That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give , She was a charmer and could almost read
Now , noble peers . the cause why we are met Is to determine of the coronation . In God’s name , speak . When is the royal day
Is all things ready for the royal time
It is , and wants but nomination .
Tomorrow , then , I judge a happy day .
Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein Who is most inward with the noble duke
Your Grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
We know each other’s faces for our hearts , He knows no more of mine than I of yours , Or I of his , my lord , than you of mine . Lord Hastings , you and he are near in love .
I thank his Grace . I know he loves me well . But for his purpose in the coronation , I have not sounded him , nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein . But you , my honorable lords , may name the time , And in the duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice , Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part .
Who governs here
A noble duke , in nature As in name .
What is his name
Orsino .
Full fathom five thy father lies . Of his bones are coral made . Those are pearls that were his eyes . Nothing of him that doth fade , But doth suffer a sea change Into something rich and strange . Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell
Ding dong .
Hark , now I hear them .
Ding dong , bell .
The ditty does remember my drowned father . This is no mortal business , nor no sound That the earth owes . I hear it now above me .
Perhaps him and her , sir . What have you to do
Not her that chides , sir , at any hand , I pray .
The fringèd curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond .
I love no chiders , sir . Biondello , let’s away .
Well begun , Tranio .
What is ’t A spirit Lord , how it looks about Believe me , sir , It carries a brave form . But ’tis a spirit .
Sir , a word ere you go . Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of , yea or no
An if I be , sir , is it any offense
No , wench It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have , such . This gallant which thou seest Was in the wrack . And , but he’s something stained With grief that’s beauty’s canker , thou mightst call him A goodly person . He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find em .
No , if without more words you will get you hence .
Why , sir , I pray , are not the streets as free For me as for you
But so is not she .
For what reason , I beseech you
For this reason , if you’ll know That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio .
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio .
Softly , my masters . If you be gentlemen , Do me this right hear me with patience . Baptista is a noble gentleman , To whom my father is not all unknown , And were his daughter fairer than she is , She may more suitors have , and me for one .
In happy time here comes the duke himself .
My noble lords and cousins all , good morrow . I have been long a sleeper but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concluded .
Had you not come upon your cue , my lord , William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part I mean your voice for crowning of the king .
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder . His Lordship knows me well , and loves me well . My lord of Ely , when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there I do beseech you , send for some of them .
Marry and will , my lord , with all my heart .
Orsino . I have heard my father name him . He was a bachelor then .
And so is now , or was so very late . For but a month ago I went from hence , And then ’twas fresh in murmur as , you know , What great ones do the less will prattle of That he did seek the love of fair Olivia .
What’s she
A virtuous maid , the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since , then leaving her In the protection of his son , her brother , Who shortly also died , for whose dear love , They say , she hath abjured the company And sight of men .
Oh , that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world , Till I had made mine own occasion mellow , What my estate is .
Cousin of Buckingham , a word with you . They move aside Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business And finds the testy gentleman so hot As he will lose his head ere give consent His master’s child , as worshipfully he terms it , Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne .
Withdraw yourself awhile . I’ll go with you .
That were hard to compass , Because she will admit no kind of suit , No , not the duke’s .
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie , And young affection gapes to be his heir . That fair for which love groaned for and would die With tender Juliet matched , is now not fair . Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks . Being held a foe , he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear . And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere . But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince’s brother , was a villain .
Write down Prince John a villain . Why , this is flat perjury , to call a prince’s brother villain .
Master Constable
Pray thee , fellow , peace . I do not like thy look , I promise thee .
What heard you him say else
Marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully .
Flat burglary as ever was committed .
Yea , by Mass , that it is .
What else , fellow
And that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly , and not marry her .
The thoughts of people . She told her , while she kept it Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love , but if she lost it Or made gift of it , my father’s eye Should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt After new fancies . She , dying , gave it me And bid me , when my fate would have me wived , To give it her . I did so , and take heed on ’t , Make it a darling like your precious eye . To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition As nothing else could match .
O villain Thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this .
Is ’t possible
What else
Tis true . There’s magic in the web of it . A sibyl , that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses , In her prophetic fury sewed the work . The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk , And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens hearts .
This is all .
Indeed Is ’t true
Most veritable , therefore look to ’t well .
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t
Ha Wherefore
Why do you speak so startingly and rash
Is ’t lost Is ’t gone Speak , is ’t out o th way
Bless us
No , good my lord let’s fight with gentle words Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords .
O God , O God that e’er this tongue of mine , That laid the sentence of dread banishment On yon proud man , should take it off again With words of sooth O that I were as great As is my grief , or lesser than my name Or that I could forget what I have been , Or not remember what I must be now Swell’st thou , proud heart I’ll give thee scope to beat , Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me .
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke .
What must the king do now must he submit The king shall do it must he be deposed The king shall be contented must he lose The name of king o’ God’s name , let it go I’ll give my jewels for a set of beads , My gorgeous palace for a hermitage , My gay apparel for an almsman’s gown , My figured goblets for a dish of wood , My sceptre for a palmer’s walking staff , My subjects for a pair of carved saints And my large kingdom for a little grave , A little little grave , an obscure grave Or I’ll be buried in the king’s highway , Some way of common trade , where subjects’ feet May hourly trample on their sovereign’s head For on my heart they tread now whilst I live And buried once , why not upon my head Aumerle , thou weep’st , my tender hearted cousin We’ll make foul weather with despised tears Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn , And make a dearth in this revolting land . Or shall we play the wantons with our woes , And make some pretty match with shedding tears As thus , to drop them still upon one place , Till they have fretted us a pair of graves Within the earth and , therein laid , there lies Two kinsmen digg’d their graves with weeping eyes . Would not this ill do well Well , well , I see I talk but idly , and you laugh at me . Most mighty prince , my Lord Northumberland , What says King Bolingbroke will his majesty Give Richard leave to live till Richard die You make a leg , and Bolingbroke says ay .
Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers Then well one more may fair Bianca have . And so she shall . Lucentio shall make one , Though ParisParis was the Trojan prince who stole Helen from her Greek husband , starting the Trojan War . Paris came in hope to speed alone .
What This gentleman will out talk us all .
Sir , give him head I know he’ll prove a jade .
Hortensio , to what end are all these words
Sir , let me be so bold as ask you , Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter
No , sir , but hear I do that he hath two , The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty .
Sir , sir , the first’s for me let her go by .
Yea , leave that labor to great Hercules , And let it be more than Alcides twelve .
Sir , understand you this of me , in sooth The youngest daughter , whom you hearken for , Her father keeps from all access of suitors And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be wed . The younger then is free , and not before .
I might call him A thing divine , for nothing natural I ever saw so noble .
It goes on , I see , As my soul prompts it . Spirit , fine spirit I’ll free thee Within two days for this .
Most sure , the goddess On whom these airs attend Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island , And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here . My prime request , Which I do last pronounce , is O you wonder If you be maid or no .
No wonder , sir , But certainly a maid .
My language Heavens , I am the best of them that speak this speech , Were I but where ’tis spoken .
How The best What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee
A single thing , as I am now , that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples . He does hear me , And that he does I weep . Myself am Naples , Who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld The king my father wracked .
Alack , for mercy
Can I go forward when my heart is here Turn back , dull earth , and find thy center out .
Romeo , my cousin Romeo Romeo
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol n him home to bed .
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall . Call , good Mercutio .
Nay , I’ll conjure too Romeo Humours , madman , passion , lover Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied . Cry but Ay me Pronounce but love and dove . Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid . He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not . The ape is dead , and I must conjure him . I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes , By her high forehead and her scarlet lip , By her fine foot , straight leg , and quivering thigh , And the demesnes that there adjacent lie , That in thy likeness thou appear to us .
We have not yet set down this day of triumph . Tomorrow , in my judgement , is too sudden , For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be , were the day prolonged .
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester I have sent for these strawberries .
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning . There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit . I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he , For by his face straight shall you know his heart .
What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today
Marry , that with no man here he is offended , For were he , he had shown it in his looks .
I pray God he be not , I say .
I pray you all , tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damnèd witchcraft , and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms
There is a fair behavior in thee , captain , And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character . I prithee and I’ll pay thee bounteously Conceal me what I am , and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent . I’ll serve this duke . Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him . It may be worth thy pains , for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service . What else may hap to time I will commit . Only shape thou thy silence to my wit .
Be you his eunuch , and your mute I’ll be . When my tongue blabs , then let mine eyes not see .
I thank thee . Lead me on .
If it be so , sir , that you are the man Must stead us all , and me amongst the rest , And if you break the ice and do this feat , Achieve the elder , set the younger free For our access , whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate .
Sir , you say well , and well you do conceive . And since you do profess to be a suitor , You must , as we do , gratify this gentleman , To whom we all rest generally beholding .
And this is more , masters , than you can deny . Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away . Hero was in this manner accused , in this very manner refused , and upon the grief of this , suddenly died . Master Constable , let these men be bound and brought to Leonato’s . I will go before and show him their examination .
Come , let them be opinioned .
Sir , I shall not be slack in sign whereof , Please ye we may contrive this afternoon And quaff carouses to our mistress health And do as adversaries do in law , Strive mightily , but eat and drink as friends .
Say you
Let them be in the hands
Off , coxcomb
It is not lost , but what and if it were
O excellent motion Fellows , let’s be gone .
How
The motion’s good indeed and be it so . Petruchio , I shall be your ben venuto .
God’s my life , where’s the Sexton Let him write down the Prince’s officer coxcomb . Come , bind them . Thou naughty varlet
Away You are an ass , you are an ass
Dost thou not suspect my place Dost thou not suspect my years Oh , that he were here to write me down an ass But masters , remember that I am an ass , though it be not written down , yet forget not that I am an ass . No , thou villain , thou art full of piety , as shall be proved upon thee by good witness . I am a wise fellow and , which is more , an officer and , which is more , a householder and , which is more , as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina , and one that knows the law , go to , and a rich fellow enough , go to , and a fellow that hath had losses , and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him . Bring him away . Oh , that I had been writ down an ass
I say , it is not lost .
Fetch ’t , let me see ’t .
Why , so I can , sir , but I will not now . This is a trick to put me from my suit . Pray you , let Cassio be received again .
Yes , faith , and all his lords , the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain .
A word , good sir . I fear you have done yourself some wrong . A word .
Why speaks my father so ungently This Is the third man that e er I saw , the first That e er I sighed for . Pity move my father To be inclined my way
Oh , if a virgin , And your affection not gone forth , I’ll make you The queen of Naples .
Soft , sir One word more . One word more . I charge thee That thou attend me . Thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not , and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy to win it From me , the lord on ’t .
No , as I am a man
The tender love I bear your Grace , my lord , Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th offenders , whosoe er they be . I say , my lord , they have deservèd death .
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil . Look how I am bewitched Behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling withered up And this is Edward’s wife , that monstrous witch , Consorted with that harlot , strumpet Shore , That by their witchcraft thus have markèd me .
If they have done this deed , my noble lord
If Thou protector of this damnèd strumpet , Talk’st thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor Off with his head . Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same . Lovell and Ratcliffe , look that it be done . The rest that love me , rise and follow me .
Woe , woe for England Not a whit for me , For I , too fond , might have prevented this . Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm , And I did scorn it and disdain to fly . Three times today my foot cloth horse did stumble , And started when he looked upon the Tower , As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse . O , now I need the priest that spake to me
Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives .
Come , come , You’ll never meet a more sufficient man .
The handkerchief
A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love , Shared dangers with you
The handkerchief
In sooth , you are to blame .
Away
My lord , in the base court he doth attend To speak with you may it please you to come down .
Down , down I come like glistering Phaethon , Wanting the manage of unruly jades . In the base court Base court , where kings grow base , To come at traitors’ calls and do them grace . In the base court Come down Down , court down , king For night owls shriek where mounting larks should sing .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
Is not this man jealous
What says his majesty
This cannot anger him . Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress circle Of some strange nature , letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down . That were some spite . My invocation Is fair and honest . In his mistress name I conjure only but to raise up him .
Sorrow and grief of heart Makes him speak fondly , like a frantic man Yet he is come .
Come , he hath hid himself among these trees , To be consorted with the humorous night . Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
What a plague means my niece , to take the death of her brother thus I am sure care’s an enemy to life .
By my troth , Sir Toby , you must come in earlier o nights . Your cousin , my lady , takes great exceptions to your ill hours .
Why , let her except , before excepted .
Ay , but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order .
Confine I’ll confine myself no finer than I am . These clothes are good enough to drink in , and so be these boots too . An they be not , let them hang themselves in their own straps .
That quaffing and drinking will undo you I heard my lady talk of it yesterday , and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer .
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek
Ay , he .
He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria .
If love be blind , love cannot hit the mark . Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone . O Romeo , that she were Oh , that she were An open arse , and thou a poperin pear . Romeo , good night . I’ll to my truckle bed . This field bed is too cold for me to sleep . Come , shall we go
Go , then , for ’tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .
Stand all apart , And show fair duty to his majesty .
My gracious lord ,
Fair cousin , you debase your princely knee To make the base earth proud with kissing it Me rather had my heart might feel your love Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy . Up , cousin , up your heart is up , I know , Thus high at least , although your knee be low .
Good sister , wrong me not nor wrong yourself , To make a bondmaid and a slave of me . That I disdain . But for these other goods Unbind my hands , I’ll pull them off myself , Yea , all my raiment to my petticoat , Or what you will command me will I do , So well I know my duty to my elders .
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lovest best . See thou dissemble not .
Believe me , sister , of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other .
Minion , thou liest . Is ’t not Hortensio
If you affect him , sister , here I swear I’ll plead for you myself , but you shall have him .
Oh , then belike you fancy riches more . You will have Gremio to keep you fair .
Is it for him you do envy me so Nay , then you jest , and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while . I prithee , sister Kate , untie my hands .
There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple . If the ill spirit have so fair a house , Good things will strive to dwell with ’t .
Come , I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together . Seawater shalt thou drink . Thy food shall be The fresh brook mussles , withered roots , and husks Wherein the acorn cradled . Follow .
No . I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power .
O dear father , Make not too rash a trial of him , for He’s gentle and not fearful .
What , I say My foot my tutor Put thy sword up , traitor , Who makest a show but darest not strike , thy conscience Is so possessed with guilt . Come from thy ward , For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop .
Beseech you , father .
Hence Hang not on my garments .
If you go on thus , you will kill yourself , And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself .
I pray thee , cease thy counsel , Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve . Give not me counsel , Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine . Bring me a father that so loved his child , Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine , And bid him speak of patience . Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine , And let it answer every strain for strain , As thus for thus and such a grief for such , In every lineament , branch , shape , and form . If such a one will smile and stroke his beard , Bid sorrow wag , cry hem when he should groan , Patch grief with proverbs , make misfortune drunk With candle wasters , bring him yet to me And I of him will gather patience . But there is no such man . For , brother , men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel , but , tasting it , Their counsel turns to passion which before Would give preceptial med cine to rage , Fetter strong madness in a silken thread , Charm ache with air , and agony with words .
I now repent I told the pursuivant , As too triumphing , how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered , And I myself secure in grace and favor . O Margaret , Margaret , now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings wretched head .
Come , come , dispatch . The duke would be at dinner . Make a short shrift . He longs to see your head .
I ne er saw this before . Sure , there’s some wonder in this handkerchief , I am most unhappy in the loss of it .
O momentary grace of mortal men , Which we more hunt for than the grace of God Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep .
Tis not a year or two shows us a man . They are all but stomachs , and we all but food . To eat us hungerly , and when they are full , They belch us . Look you , Cassio and my husband
Come , come , dispatch . Tis bootless to exclaim .
There is no other way . Tis she must do ’t , And , lo , the happiness Go and importune her .
O bloody Richard Miserable England , I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon . Come , lead me to the block . Bear him my head . They smile at me that shortly shall be dead .
How now , good Cassio , what’s the news with you
Madam , my former suit . I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist , and be a member of his love Whom I , with all the office of my heart Entirely honor . I would not be delayed . If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past , nor present sorrows , Nor purposed merit in futurity , Can ransom me into his love again , But to know so must be my benefit . So shall I clothe me in a forced content , And shut myself up in some other course , To fortune’s alms .
If that be jest , then all the rest was so .
Why , how now , dame whence grows this insolence Bianca , stand aside . Poor girl , she weeps For shame , thou hilding of a devilish spirit Why dost thou wrong her that did ne er wrong thee When did she cross thee with a bitter word
Her silence flouts me , and I’ll be revenged .
What , in my sight Bianca , get thee in .
What , will you not suffer me Nay , now I see She is your treasure , she must have a husband , I must dance barefoot on her wedding day And , for your love to her , lead apes in hell . Talk not to me . I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge .
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I But who comes here
What’s that to the purpose
My gracious lord , I come but for mine own .
Your own is yours , and I am yours , and all .
No , no , ’tis all men’s office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow , But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself . Therefore give me no counsel . My griefs cry louder than advertisement .
Therein do men from children nothing differ .
I pray thee , peace . I will be flesh and blood , For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently , However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance .
Why , he has three thousand ducats a year .
Ay , but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats . He’s a very fool and a prodigal .
So far be mine , my most redoubted lord , As my true service shall deserve your love .
Well you deserve they well deserve to have , That know the strong’st and surest way to get . Uncle , give me your hands nay , dry your eyes Tears show their love , but want their remedies . Cousin , I am too young to be your father , Though you are old enough to be my heir . What you will have , I’ll give , and willing too For do we must what force will have us do . Set on towards London , cousin , is it so
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself . Make those that do offend you suffer too .
Yea , my good lord .
Then I must not say no .
Fie , that you’ll say so He plays o the viol de gamboys , and speaks three or four languages word for word without book , and hath all the good gifts of nature .
He hath indeed , almost natural , for besides that he’s a fool , he’s a great quarreler , and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling , ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave .
There thou speak’st reason . Nay , I will do so . My soul doth tell me Hero is belied , And that shall Claudio know so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her .
By this hand , they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him . Who are they
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily .
Good e en , good e en .
Good day to both of you .
Hear you , my lords
We have some haste , Leonato .
They that add , moreover , he’s drunk nightly in your company .
With drinking healths to my niece . I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria . He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o th toe like a parish top . What , wench Castiliano vulgo , for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface .
Sir Toby Belch How now , Sir Toby Belch
Sweet Sir Andrew
He jests at scars that never felt a wound .
But soft What light through yonder window breaks It is the east , and Juliet is the sun . Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , Who is already sick and pale with grief , That thou , her maid , art far more fair than she . Be not her maid since she is envious . Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it . Cast it off It is my lady . Oh , it is my love . Oh , that she knew she were She speaks , yet she says nothing . What of that Her eye discourses . I will answer it . I am too bold . Tis not to me she speaks . Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return . What if her eyes were there , they in her head The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp . Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night . See how she leans her cheek upon her hand . Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek
Ay me
Sir , have pity , I’ll be his surety .
Silence One word more Shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee . What , An advocate for an imposter Hush , Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he , Having seen but him and Caliban . Foolish wench , To th most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels .
My affections Are then most humble . I have no ambition To see a goodlier man .
Come on . Obey . Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigor in them .
So they are . My spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up . My father’s loss , the weakness which I feel , The wrack of all my friends , nor this man’s threats , To whom I am subdued , are but light to me , Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid . All corners else o th earth Let liberty make use of . Space enough Have I in such a prison .
Hark what thou else shalt do me .
Good morrow , neighbor Baptista .
Good morrow , neighbor Gremio . God save you , gentlemen
And you , good sir . Pray , have you not a daughter Called Katherina , fair and virtuous
I have a daughter , sir , called Katherina .
You are too blunt . Go to it orderly .
You wrong me , Signior Gremio . Give me leave . I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , That hearing of her beauty and her wit , Her affability and bashful modesty , Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior , Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house , to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard . And , for an entrance to my entertainment , I do present you with a man of mine , Cunning in music and the mathematics , To instruct her fully in those sciences , Whereof I know she is not ignorant . Accept of him , or else you do me wrong . His name is Litio , born in Mantua .
Come , cousin , canst thou quake and change thy color , Murder thy breath in the middle of a word , And then begin again , and stop again , As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror
Tut , I can counterfeit the deep tragedian , Speak , and look back , and pry on every side , Tremble and start at wagging of a straw , Intending deep suspicion . Ghastly looks Are at my service , like enforcèd smiles , And both are ready in their offices , At any time to grace my stratagems . But what , is Catesby gone
He is and see , he brings the mayor along .
Lord Mayor
Look to the drawbridge there
Hark , a drum
Catesby , o erlook the walls .
Some haste , my lord Well , fare you well , my lord . Are you so hasty now Well , all is one .
Nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
If he could right himself with quarreling , Some of us would lie low .
Who wrongs him
Marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou . Nay , never lay thy hand upon thy sword . I fear thee not .
Marry , beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear . In faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
Tush , tush , man , never fleer and jest at me . I speak not like a dotard nor a fool , As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young , or what would do Were I not old . Know , Claudio , to thy head , Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by , And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man . I say thou hast belied mine innocent child . Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart , And she lies buried with her ancestors , Oh , in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers , framed by thy villainy .
My villainy
Alas , thrice gentle Cassio , My advocation is not now in tune . My lord is not my lord , nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered . So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech . You must awhile be patient . What I can do I will , and more I will Than for myself I dare . Let that suffice you .
Is my lord angry
He went hence but now , And certainly in strange unquietness .
Can he be angry I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And , like the devil , from his very arm Puffed his own brother and is he angry Something of moment then , I will go meet him . There’s matter in ’t indeed , if he be angry .
I prithee , do so .
Something , sure , of state , Either from Venice , or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him , Hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things , Though great ones are their object . Tis even so , For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain . Nay , we must think men are not gods , Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal . Beshrew me much , Emilia , I was , unhandsome warrior as I am , Arraigning his unkindness with my soul , But now I find I had suborned the witness , And he’s indicted falsely .
Thine , Claudio , thine , I say .
You say not right , old man .
My lord , my lord , I’ll prove it on his body if he dare , Despite his nice fence and his active practice , His May of youth and bloom of lustihood .
Away I will not have to do with you .
Canst thou so daff me Thou hast killed my child . If thou kill’st me , boy , thou shalt kill a man .
He shall kill two of us , and men indeed , But that’s no matter . Let him kill one first . Win me and wear me Let him answer me . Come , follow me , boy . Come , sir boy , come , follow me . Sir boy , I’ll whip you from your foining fence , Nay , as I am a gentleman , I will .
Brother
Content yourself . God knows I loved my niece , And she is dead , slandered to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue . Boys , apes , braggarts , jacks , milksops
Brother Anthony
You’re welcome , sir , and he for your good sake . But for my daughter Katherine , this I know , She is not for your turn , the more my grief .
I see you do not mean to part with her , Or else you like not of my company .
Mistake me not . I speak but as I find . Whence are you , sir What may I call your name
Petruchio is my name , Antonio’s son , A man well known throughout all Italy .
I know him well . You are welcome for his sake .
Saving your tale , Petruchio , I pray Let us that are poor petitioners speak too . Bacare , you are marvelous forward .
Oh , pardon me , Signior Gremio , I would fain be doing .
I doubt it not , sir , but you will curse your wooing . Neighbor , this is a gift very grateful , I am sure of it . To express the like kindness , myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar that hath been long studying at Rheims , as cunning in Greek , Latin , and other languages as the other in music and mathematics . His name is Cambio . Pray accept his service .
What sport shall we devise here in this garden , To drive away the heavy thought of care
Madam , we’ll play at bowls .
’Twill make me think the world is full of rubs , And that my fortune rubs against the bias .
Madam , we’ll dance .
My legs can keep no measure in delight , When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief Therefore , no dancing , girl some other sport .
Madam , we’ll tell tales .
Of sorrow or of joy
Of either , madam .
Of neither , girl For of joy , being altogether wanting , It doth remember me the more of sorrow Or if of grief , being altogether had , It adds more sorrow to my want of joy For what I have I need not to repeat And what I want it boots not to complain .
Madam , I’ll sing .
’Tis well that thou hast cause But thou shouldst please me better , wouldst thou weep .
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent
Look back Defend thee Here are enemies .
God and our innocence defend and guard us
Be patient . They are friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor , The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
So dear I loved the man that I must weep . I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breathed upon this earth a Christian Made him my book , wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts . So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That , his apparent open guilt omitted I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife He lived from all attainder of suspects .
Well , well , he was the covert’st sheltered traitor That ever lived . Would you imagine , or almost believe , Were ’t not that by great preservation We live to tell it , that subtle traitor This day had plotted , in the council house To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester
Had he done so
Bless you , fair shrew .
She speaks . O , speak again , bright angel For thou art As glorious to this night , being o er my head , As is a wingèd messenger of heaven Unto the white , upturnèd , wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air .
And you too , sir .
Accost , Sir Andrew , accost .
O Romeo , Romeo Wherefore art thou Romeo Deny thy father and refuse thy name . Or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , And I’ll no longer be a Capulet .
What’s that
Shall I hear more , or shall I speak at this
My niece’s chambermaid .
Good Mistress Accost , I desire better acquaintance .
My name is Mary , sir .
Tis but thy name that is my enemy . Thou art thyself , though not a Montague . What’s Montague It is nor hand , nor foot , Nor arm , nor face , nor any other part Belonging to a man . O , be some other name What’s in a name That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet . So Romeo would , were he not Romeo called , Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title . Romeo , doff thy name , And for that name , which is no part of thee Take all myself .
I take thee at thy word . Call me but love , and I’ll be new baptized . Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel
Good Mistress Mary Accost
You mistake , knight . Accost is front her , board her , woo her , assail her .
By my troth , I would not undertake her in this company . Is that the meaning of accost
Fare you well , gentlemen .
An thou let part so , Sir Andrew , would thou mightst never draw sword again .
An you part so , mistress , I would I might never draw sword again . Fair lady , do you think you have fools in hand
Sir , I have not you by the hand .
A thousand thanks , Signior Gremio . Welcome , good Cambio . But , gentle sir , methinks you walk like a stranger . May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming
Pardon me , sir , the boldness is mine own , That being a stranger in this city here Do make myself a suitor to your daughter , Unto Bianca , fair and virtuous . Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me , In the preferment of the eldest sister . This liberty is all that I request , That , upon knowledge of my parentage , I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo And free access and favor as the rest . And toward the education of your daughters , I here bestow a simple instrument And this small packet of Greek and Latin books . BIONDELLO brings the gifts forward If you accept them , then their worth is great .
Lucentio is your name . Of whence , I pray
Of Pisa , sir , son to Vincentio .
A mighty man of Pisa . By report I know him well . You are very welcome , sir . and you the set of books . You shall go see your pupils presently . Holla , within
Be of comfort . My father’s of a better nature , sir , Than he appears by speech . This is unwonted Which now came from him .
Thou shalt be free As mountain winds . But then exactly do All points of my command .
To th syllable .
Speak not for him .
I could weep , madam , would it do you good .
And I could sing , would weeping do me good , And never borrow any tear of thee .
But stay , here come the gardeners Let’s step into the shadow of these trees . My wretchedness unto a row of pins , They’ll talk of state for every one doth so Against a change woe is forerun with woe .
Go , bind thou up yon dangling apricocks , Which , like unruly children , make their sire Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight Give some supportance to the bending twigs . Go thou , and like an executioner , Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays , That look too lofty in our commonwealth All must be even in our government . You thus employ’d , I will go root away The noisome weeds , which without profit suck The soil’s fertility from wholesome flowers .
Why should we in the compass of a pale Keep law and form and due proportion , Showing , as in a model , our firm estate , When our sea walled garden , the whole land , Is full of weeds , her fairest flowers choked up , Her fruit trees all upturned , her hedges ruin’d , Her knots disorder’d and her wholesome herbs Swarming with caterpillars
What , think you we are Turks or infidels Or that we would , against the form of law , Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death , But that the extreme peril of the case , The peace of England and our persons safety Enforced us to this execution
Now fair befall you He deserved his death , And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts .
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am . My name , dear saint , is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee . Had I it written , I would tear the word .
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore . Yet had we not determined he should die Until your Lordship came to see his end , Because , my lord , I would have had you heard The traitor speak , and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons , That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens , who haply may Misconstrue us in him , and wail his death .
But , my good lord , your Graces words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And do not doubt , right noble princes both , But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case .
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T avoid the censures of the carping world .
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue’s uttering , yet I know the sound . Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague
Neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .
How camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .
Pray heaven it be State matters , as you think , and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you .
Alas the day I never gave him cause .
But jealous souls will not be answered so . They are not ever jealous for the cause , But jealous for they’re jealous . It is a monster Begot upon itself , born on itself .
With love’s light wings did I o erperch these walls , For stony limits cannot hold love out , And what love can do , that dares love attempt . Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind
Lady , amen .
I will go seek him . Cassio , walk hereabout . If I do find him fit , I’ll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost .
I humbly thank your ladyship .
Save you , friend Cassio
Marry , but you shall have , and here’s my hand .
Now , sir , thought is free . I pray you , bring your hand to the buttery bar and let it drink .
Wherefore , sweetheart What’s your metaphor
It’s dry , sir .
Why , I think so . I am not such an ass , but I can keep my hand dry . But what’s your jest
A dry jest , sir .
Are you full of them
Ay , sir , I have them at my fingers ends . Marry , now I let go your hand , I am barren .
O knight , thou lackest a cup of canary . When did I see thee so put down
Never in your life , I think , unless you see canary put me down . Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has . But I am a great eater of beef , and I believe that does harm to my wit .
No question .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .
Alack , there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords . Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes , And but thou love me , let them find me here . My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd , wanting of thy love .
Sirrah , lead these gentlemen To my daughters , and tell them both These are their tutors . Bid them use them well .
We will go walk a little in the orchard , And then to dinner . You are passing welcome , And so I pray you all to think yourselves .
Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I cannot come to woo . You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have bettered rather than decreased . Then tell me , if I get your daughter’s love , What dowry shall I have with her to wife
After my death , the one half of my lands , And , in possession , twenty thousand crowns .
And , for that dowry , I’ll assure her of Her widowhood , be it that she survive me , In all my lands and leases whatsoever . Let specialties be therefore drawn between us , That covenants may be kept on either hand .
Ay , when the special thing is well obtained , That is , her love , for that is all in all .
Why , that is nothing . For I tell you , father , I am as peremptory as she proud minded And where two raging fires meet together , They do consume the thing that feeds their fury . Though little fire grows great with little wind , Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all . So I to her and so she yields to me , For I am rough and woo not like a babe .
Hold you content . What , man I know them , yea , And what they weigh , even to the utmost scruple Scrambling , outfacing , fashion monging boys , That lie and cog and flout , deprave and slander , Go anticly and show outward hideousness , And speak off half a dozen dang rous words How they might hurt their enemies , if they durst , And this is all .
But brother Anthony
Come , ’tis no matter . Do not you meddle . Let me deal in this .
Gentlemen both , we will not wake your patience . My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death , But , on my honor , she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof .
Beseech you , sir , be merry . You have cause , So have we all , of joy , for our escape Is much beyond our loss . Our hint of woe Is common . Every day some sailor’s wife , The masters of some merchant , and the merchant Have just our theme of woe . But for the miracle I mean our preservation few in millions Can speak like us . Then wisely , good sir , weigh Our sorrow with our comfort .
My lord , my lord
I will not hear you .
No Come , brother away I will be heard .
Prithee , peace .
He receives comfort like cold porridge .
And shall , or some of us will smart for it .
The visitor will not give him o er so .
Look he’s winding up the watch of his wit . By and by it will strike .
Sir
See , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
Now , Signior , what news
One . Tell .
When every grief is entertained that’s offered , Comes to th entertainer
Hold thy peace He that hath suffer’d this disorder’d spring Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf The weeds which his broad spreading leaves did shelter , That seem’d in eating him to hold him up , Are pluck’d up root and all by Bolingbroke , I mean the Earl of Wiltshire , Bushy , Green .
What , are they dead
Which since you come too late of our intent , Yet witness what you hear we did intend . And so , my good Lord Mayor , we bid farewell .
They are and Bolingbroke Hath seized the wasteful king . O , what pity is it That he had not so trimm’d and dress’d his land As we this garden We at time of year Do wound the bark , the skin of our fruit trees , Lest , being over proud in sap and blood , With too much riches it confound itself Had he done so to great and growing men , They might have lived to bear and he to taste Their fruits of duty superfluous branches We lop away , that bearing boughs may live Had he done so , himself had borne the crown , Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down .
What , think you then the king shall be deposed
Depress’d he is already , and deposed ’Tis doubt he will be letters came last night To a dear friend of the good Duke of York’s , That tell black tidings .
Go , after , after , cousin Buckingham . The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post . There , at your meetest vantage of the time , Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children . Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crown meaning indeed his house , Which , by the sign thereof , was termèd so . Moreover , urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust , Which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , Even where his raging eye or savage heart , Without control , lusted to make his prey . Nay , for a need , thus far come near my person Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward , noble York My princely father then had wars in France , And , by true computation of the time , Found that the issue was not his begot , Which well appearèd in his lineaments , Being nothing like the noble duke my father . Yet touch this sparingly , as ’twere far off , Because , my lord , you know my mother lives .
Well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed . But be thou armed for some unhappy words .
Ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , That shakes not , though they blow perpetually .
How now , my friend , why dost thou look so pale
For fear , I promise you , if I look pale .
What , will my daughter prove a good musician
What make you from home How is ’t with you , my most fair Bianca Indeed , sweet love , I was coming to your house .
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier . Iron may hold with her , but never lutes .
Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute
And I was going to your lodging , Cassio . What , keep a week away Seven days and nights Eight score eight hours And lovers absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times Oh weary reckoning
Why , no , for she hath broke the lute to me . I did but tell her she mistook her frets , And bowed her hand to teach her fingering , When , with a most impatient devilish spirit , Frets call you these quoth she . I’ll fume with them And with that word she struck me on the head , And through the instrument my pate made way ,
Pardon me , Bianca , I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed , But I shall , in a more continuate time , Strike off this score of absence . Sweet Bianca , Take me this work out .
O Cassio , whence came this This is some token from a newer friend To the felt absence now I feel a cause . Is ’t come to this Well , well .
Go to , woman , Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth From whence you have them . You are jealous now That this is from some mistress , some remembrance . No , in good troth , Bianca .
Why , whose is it
I know not neither , I found it in my chamber . I like the work well . Ere it be demanded , As like enough it will , I would have it copied . Take it and do ’t , and leave me for this time .
Leave you Wherefore
A dollar .
Dolor comes to him , indeed . You have spoken truer than you purposed .
Good day , my lord .
Welcome , Signior . You are almost come to part almost a fray .
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should .
Therefore , my lord
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth .
Leonato and his brother . What think’st thou Had we fought , I doubt we should have been too young for them .
Fie , what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
In a false quarrel there is no true valor . I came to seek you both .
I prithee , spare .
We have been up and down to seek thee , for we are high proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away . Wilt thou use thy wit
It is in my scabbard . Shall I draw it
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side
Well , I have done . But yet
He will be talking .
Which , of he or Adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow
The old cock .
Never any did so , though very many have been beside their wit . I will bid thee draw , as we do the minstrels draw to pleasure us .
An I thought that , I’d forswear it . I’ll ride home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
Pourquoi , my dear knight
What is pourquoi Do , or not do I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing , dancing , and bear baiting . O , had I but followed the arts
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair .
Why , would that have mended my hair
Past question , for thou seest it will not curl by nature .
As I am an honest man , he looks pale . Art thou sick , or angry
The cockerel .
Done . The wager
What , courage , man What though care killed a cat Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
By whose direction found’st thou out this place
By love , that first did prompt me to inquire . He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes . I am no pilot . Yet , wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea , I would adventure for such merchandise .
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight . Fain would I dwell on form . Fain , fain deny What I have spoke . But farewell compliment Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say ay , And I will take thy word . Yet if thou swear’st Thou mayst prove false . At lovers perjuries , They say , Jove laughs . O gentle Romeo , If thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully . Or if thou think’st I am too quickly won , I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay , So thou wilt woo . But else , not for the world . In truth , fair Montague , I am too fond , And therefore thou mayst think my havior light . But trust me , gentleman , I’ll prove more true Than those that have more coying to be strange . I should have been more strange , I must confess , But that thou overheard’st , ere I was ware , My true love’s passion . Therefore pardon me , And not impute this yielding to light love , Which the dark night hath so discovered .
Lady , by yonder blessèd moon I vow , That tips with silver all these fruit tree tops
A laughter .
A match
Though this island seem to be desert
Ha , ha , ha
But it becomes me well enough , does ’t not
Excellent . It hangs like flax on a distaff . And I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off .
Faith , I’ll home tomorrow , Sir Toby . Your niece will not be seen . Or if she be , it’s four to one she’ll none of me . The count himself here hard by woos her .
She’ll none o the count . She’ll not match above her degree , neither in estate , years , nor wit . I have heard her swear ’t . Tut , there’s life in ’t , man .
And there I stood amazèd for a while As on a pillory , looking through the lute , While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms , As had she studied to misuse me so .
Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench . I love her ten times more than e er I did . Oh , how I long to have some chat with her
Well , go with me and be not so discomfited . Proceed in practice with my younger daughter . She’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns . Signior Petruchio , will you go with us , Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you
I pray you do .
I’ll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes . Say that she rail why then I’ll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale . Say that she frown I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew . Say she be mute and will not speak a word Then I’ll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence . If she do bid me pack , I’ll give her thanks , As though she bid me stay by her a week . If she deny to wed , I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd . But here she comes and now , Petruchio , speak .
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition , nor my wish , To have him see me womaned .
Why , I pray you
Not that I love you not .
But that you do not love me . I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night .
Tis but a little way that I can bring you , For I attend here . But I’ll see you soon .
Tis very good . I must be circumstanced .
O , swear not by the moon , th inconstant moon , That monthly changes in her circle orb , Lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
What shall I swear by
Do not swear at all . Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I’ll believe thee .
If my heart’s dear love
Well , do not swear . Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight . It is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden , Too like the lightning , which doth cease to be Ere one can say It lightens . Sweet , good night . This bud of love , by summer’s ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . Good night , good night As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .
Doubt not , my lord . I’ll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself . And so , my lord , adieu .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight
If you thrive well , bring them to Baynard’s Castle , Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well learnèd bishops .
Th exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine .
I go and towards three or four o clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords .
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .
Go , Lovell , with all speed to Doctor Shaw . Go thou to Friar Penker . Bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle .
Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose , love
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight , And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes .
O , I am press’d to death through want of speaking
Thou , old Adam’s likeness , set to dress this garden , How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news What Eve , what serpent , hath suggested thee To make a second fall of cursed man Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed Darest thou , thou little better thing than earth , Divine his downfall Say , where , when , and how , Camest thou by this ill tidings speak , thou wretch .
Pardon me , madam little joy have I To breathe this news yet what I say is true . King Richard , he is in the mighty hold Of Bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh’d In your lord’s scale is nothing but himself , And some few vanities that make him light But in the balance of great Bolingbroke , Besides himself , are all the English peers , And with that odds he weighs King Richard down . Post you to London , and you will find it so I speak no more than every one doth know .
Nimble mischance , that art so light of foot , Doth not thy embassage belong to me , And am I last that knows it O , thou think’st To serve me last , that I may longest keep Thy sorrow in my breast . Come , ladies , go , To meet at London London’s king in woe . What , was I born to this , that my sad look Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke Gardener , for telling me these news of woe , Pray God the plants thou graft’st may never grow .
Good morrow , Kate for that’s your name , I hear .
Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing . They call me Katherine that do talk of me .
You lie , in faith , for you are called plain Kate , And bonny Kate , and sometimes Kate the curst , But Kate , the prettiest Kate in Christendom , Kate of Kate Hall , my super dainty Kate For dainties are all Kates and therefore , Kate , Take this of me , Kate of my consolation Hearing thy mildness praised in every town , Thy virtues spoke of , and thy beauty sounded Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife .
Moved , in good time . Let him that moved you hither Remove you hence . I knew you at the first You were a moveable .
Why , what’s a moveable
So you’re paid .
A joint stool .
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
Thou hast hit it . Come , sit on me .
Yet
Asses are made to bear , and so are you .
Yet
Women are made to bear , and so are you .
He could not miss ’t .
It must needs be of subtle , tender , and delicate temperance .
Temperance was a delicate wench .
Ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
As if it had lungs , and rotten ones .
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen .
Here is everything advantageous to life .
True . Save means to live .
Of that there’s none , or little .
But to be frank , and give it thee again . And yet I wish but for the thing I have . My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep . The more I give to thee , The more I have , for both are infinite .
How lush and lusty the grass looks How green
I hear some noise within . Dear love , adieu . Anon , good Nurse Sweet Montague , be true . Stay but a little . I will come again .
The ground indeed is tawny .
With an eye of green in ’t .
He misses not much .
O blessèd , blessèd night I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings , Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed , That it may be today read o er in Paul’s . And mark how well the sequel hangs together Eleven hours I have spent to write it over , For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me The precedent was full as long a doing , And yet within these five hours Hastings lived , Untainted , unexamined , free , at liberty . Here’s a good world the while . Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device Yet who so bold but says he sees it not Bad is the world , and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought .
Sir , I shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me . I pray you , choose another subject .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed . If that thy bent of love be honorable , Thy purpose marriage , send me word tomorrow By one that I’ll procure to come to thee Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite , And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world .
Nay , then , give him another staff . This last was broke cross .
By this light , he changes more and more . I think he be angry indeed .
If he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
Shall I speak a word in your ear
God bless me from a challenge
Madam
I come , anon . But if thou mean’st not well , I do beseech thee
Madam
I’ll stay a month longer . I am a fellow o th strangest mind i th world . I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .
You are a villain . I jest not . I will make it good how you dare , with what you dare , and when you dare . Do me right , or I will protest your cowardice . You have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you . Let me hear from you .
Art thou good at these kickshawses , knight
Well , I will meet you , so I may have good cheer .
As any man in Illyria , whatsoever he be , under the degree of my betters . And yet I will not compare with an old man .
What , a feast , a feast
What is thy excellence in a galliard , knight
I faith , I thank him . He hath bid me to a calf’s head and a capon , the which if I do not carve most curiously , say my knife’s naught . Shall I not find a woodcock too
Faith , I can cut a caper .
Sir , your wit ambles well it goes easily .
And I can cut the mutton to ’t .
And I think I have the back trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria .
Wherefore are these things hid Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before em Are they like to take dust , like Mistress Mall’s picture Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto My very walk should be a jig . I would not so much as make water but in a sink a pace . What dost thou mean Is it a world to hide virtues in I did think , by the excellent constitution of thy leg , it was formed under the star of a galliard .
Ay , ’tis strong , and it does indifferent well in a dun colored stock . Shall we set about some revels
What shall we do else Were we not born under Taurus
Will you think so
Think so , Iago
What , To kiss in private
An unauthorized kiss
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more , not meaning any harm
Naked in bed , Iago , and not mean harm It is hypocrisy against the devil . They that mean virtuously , and yet do so , The devil their virtue tempts , and they tempt heaven .
So they do nothing , ’tis a venial slip . But if I give my wife a handkerchief
What then
Why then ’tis hers , my lord , and , being hers , She may , I think , bestow ’t on any man .
She is protectress of her honor too . May she give that
Poor queen so that thy state might be no worse , I would my skill were subject to thy curse . Here did she fall a tear here in this place I’ll set a bank of rue , sour herb of grace Rue , even for ruth , here shortly shall be seen , In the remembrance of a weeping queen .
Taurus That’s sides and heart .
How now , how now What say the citizens
No , sir , it is legs and thighs . Let me see the caper . Ha , higher Ha , ha , excellent
Now , by the holy mother of our Lord , The citizens are mum , say not a word .
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children
By and by , I come . To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief . Tomorrow will I send .
So thrive my soul
A thousand times good night
A thousand times the worse to want thy light . Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books , But love from love , toward school with heavy looks .
Hist Romeo , hist Oh , for a falconer’s voice , To lure this tassel gentle back again Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of My Romeo
No , he doth but mistake the truth totally .
It is my soul that calls upon my name . How silver sweet sound lovers tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears
But the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit
As many vouched rarities are .
That our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses , being rather new dyed than stained with salt water .
If but one of his pockets could speak , would it not say he lies
Ay , or very falsely pocket up his report .
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric , at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
Twas a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen .
Not since widow Dido’s time .
Widow A pox o that How came that widow in Widow Dido
I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day . I said thou hadst a fine wit . True , said she , a fine little one . No , said I , a great wit . Right , says she , a great gross one . Nay , said I , a good wit . Just , said she , it hurts nobody . Nay , said I , the gentleman is wise . Certain , said she , a wise gentleman . Nay , said I , he hath the tongues . That I believe , said she , for he swore a thing to me on Monday night , which he forswore on Tuesday morning there’s a double tongue , there’s two tongues . Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues . Yet at last she concluded with a sigh , thou wast the proper’st man in Italy .
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not .
Yea , that she did . But yet for all that , an if she did not hate him deadly , she would love him dearly . The old man’s daughter told us all .
All , all . And , moreover , God saw him when he was hid in the garden .
But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head
Yea , and text underneath Here dwells Benedick the married man
Fare you well , boy . You know my mind . I will leave you now to your gossip like humor . You break jests as braggarts do their blades , which , God be thanked , hurt not . My lord , for your many courtesies I thank you . I must discontinue your company .
I did with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France Th unsatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy , As being got , your father then in France , His resemblance being not like the duke . Withal , I did infer your lineaments , Being the right idea of your father , Both in your form and nobleness of mind Laid open all your victories in Scotland , Your discipline in war , wisdom in peace , Your bounty , virtue , fair humility Indeed , left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse . And when mine oratory grew toward end , I bid them that did love their country’s good Cry God save Richard , England’s royal king
And did they so
No such jade as you , if me you mean .
Alas , good Kate , I will not burden thee , For knowing thee to be but young and light
Too light for such a swain as you to catch , And yet as heavy as my weight should be .
Should be should buzz
Well ta en , and like a buzzard .
O slow winged turtle , shall a buzzard take thee
Ay , for a turtle , as he takes a buzzard .
Come , come , you wasp . I faith , you are too angry .
If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
My remedy is then to pluck it out .
Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting In his tail .
In his tongue .
Whose tongue
Call forth Bagot . Now , Bagot , freely speak thy mind What thou dost know of noble Gloucester’s death , Who wrought it with the king , and who perform’d The bloody office of his timeless end .
Yours , if you talk of tales . And so farewell .
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle .
Cousin , stand forth , and look upon that man .
My Lord Aumerle , I know your daring tongue Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver’d . In that dead time when Gloucester’s death was plotted , I heard you say , ‘Is not my arm of length , That reacheth from the restful English court As far as Calais , to mine uncle’s head ’ Amongst much other talk , that very time , I heard you say that you had rather refuse The offer of an hundred thousand crowns Than Bolingbroke’s return to England Adding withal how blest this land would be In this your cousin’s death .
Princes and noble lords , What answer shall I make to this base man Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars , On equal terms to give him chastisement Either I must , or have mine honour soil’d With the attainder of his slanderous lips . There is my gage , the manual seal of death , That marks thee out for hell I say , thou liest , And will maintain what thou hast said is false In thy heart blood , though being all too base To stain the temper of my knightly sword .
Romeo
Her honor is an essence that’s not seen , They have it very oft that have it not . But for the handkerchief
By heaven , I would most gladly have forgot it . Thou saidst Oh , it comes o er my memory , As doth the raven o er the infectious house , Boding to all he had my handkerchief .
Ay , what of that
That’s not so good now .
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong Or heard him say as knaves be such abroad , Who having , by their own importunate suit , Or voluntary dotage of some mistress , Convincèd or supplied them , cannot choose But they must blab
Hath he said any thing
He hath , my lord , but be you well assured No more than he’ll unswear .
What hath he said
Why , that he did I know not what he did .
What what
Lie
With her
What if he had said widower Æneas too Good Lord , how you take it
Widow Dido said you You make me study of that . She was of Carthage , not of Tunis .
My nyas
This Tunis , sir , was Carthage .
Carthage
What o clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee
I assure you , Carthage .
By the hour of nine .
His word is more than the miraculous harp . He hath raised the wall and houses too .
I will not fail . Tis twenty year till then . I have forgot why I did call thee back .
What impossible matter will he make easy next
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
I shall forget , to have thee still stand there , Remembering how I love thy company .
Ay .
And I’ll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Why , in good time .
Tis almost morning . I would have thee gone . And yet no further than a wanton’s bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving jealous of his liberty .
Sir , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter , who is now queen .
I would I were thy bird .
Sweet , so would I . Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing . Good night , good night Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina . You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady . For my Lord Lackbeard there , he and I shall meet , and till then peace be with him .
He is in earnest .
In most profound earnest , and , I’ll warrant you , for the love of Beatrice .
And hath challenged thee
Most sincerely .
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit
He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .
But soft you , let me be . Pluck up , my heart , and be sad . Did he not say my brother was fled
Come you , sir . If justice cannot tame you , she shall ne er weigh more reasons in her balance . Nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
How now Two of my brother’s men bound Borachio one
If the duke continue these favors towards you , Cesario , you are like to be much advanced . He hath known you but three days , and already you are no stranger .
You either fear his humor or my negligence , that you call in question the continuance of his love . Is he inconstant , sir , in his favors
No , believe me .
I thank you . Here comes the count .
Who saw Cesario , ho
No . So God help me , they spake not a word But , like dumb statues or breathing stones , Stared each on other and looked deadly pale Which when I saw , I reprehended them And asked the mayor what meant this willful silence . His answer was , the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder . Then he was urged to tell my tale again Thus saith the duke . Thus hath the duke inferred But nothing spoke in warrant from himself . When he had done , some followers of mine own , At the lower end of the hall , hurled up their caps , And some ten voices cried God save King Richard And thus I took the vantage of those few . Thanks , gentle citizens and friends , quoth I . This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard And even here brake off , and came away .
On your attendance , my lord , here .
What tongueless blocks were they Would not they speak Will not the mayor then and his brethren come
Cesario , Thou know’st no less but all . I have unclasped To thee the book even of my secret soul . Therefore , good youth , address thy gait unto her Be not denied access , stand at her doors , And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience .
The mayor is here at hand . Intend some fear Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit . And look you get a prayer book in your hand And stand between two churchmen , good my lord , For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant . And be not easily won to our requests . Play the maid’s part still answer nay , and take it .
I go . An if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself , No doubt we bring it to a happy issue .
What , with my tongue in your tail Nay , come again , Good Kate . I am a gentleman .
That I’ll try .
With her , on her , what you will .
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again .
Lie with her lie on her We say lie on her when they belie her Lie with her that’s fulsome . Handkerchief confessions handkerchief To confess , and be hanged for his labor . First to be hanged , and then to confess I tremble at it . Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction . It is not words that shake me thus . Pish Noses , ears , and lips . Is ’t possible Confess Handkerchief Oh , devil
Work on , My medicine , work Thus credulous fools are caught , And many worthy and chaste dames even thus , All guiltless , meet reproach . What , ho My lord My lord , I say Othello
How now , Cassio
What’s the matter
My lord is fall n into an epilepsy . This is his second fit . He had one yesterday .
Rub him about the temples .
No , forbear . The lethargy must have his quiet course . If not , he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness . Look , he stirs . Do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
So may you lose your arms . If you strike me , you are no gentleman And if no gentleman , why then no arms .
A herald , Kate Oh , put me in thy books
What is your crest A coxcomb
A combless cock , so Kate will be my hen .
No cock of mine . You crow too like a craven .
Nay , come , Kate , come . You must not look so sour .
Bagot , forbear thou shalt not take it up .
It is my fashion , when I see a crab .
Excepting one , I would he were the best In all this presence that hath moved me so .
Why , here’s no crab , and therefore look not sour .
There is , there is .
If that thy valour stand on sympathy , There is my gage , Aumerle , in gage to thine By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand’st , I heard thee say , and vauntingly thou spakest it That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death . If thou deny’st it twenty times , thou liest And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart , Where it was forged , with my rapier’s point .
Thou darest not , coward , live to see that day .
Now by my soul , I would it were this hour .
Fitzwater , thou art damn’d to hell for this .
Aumerle , thou liest his honour is as true In this appeal as thou art all unjust And that thou art so , there I throw my gage , To prove it on thee to the extremest point Of mortal breathing seize it , if thou darest .
An if I do not , may my hands rot off And never brandish more revengeful steel Over the glittering helmet of my foe
I task the earth to the like , forsworn Aumerle And spur thee on with full as many lies As may be holloa’d in thy treacherous ear From sun to sun there is my honour’s pawn Engage it to the trial , if thou darest .
And the rarest that e er came there .
Bate , I beseech you , widow Dido .
Oh , widow Dido Ay , widow Dido .
Is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it I mean , in a sort .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast . Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest . Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
That sort was well fished for .
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense . Would I had never Married my daughter there For , coming thence , My son is lost and , in my rate , she too , Who is so far from Italy removed I ne er again shall see her . O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan , what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee
Sir , he may live . I saw him beat the surges under him , And ride upon their backs . He trod the water , Whose enmity he flung aside , and breasted The surge most swoll n that met him . His bold head Bove the contentious waves he kept , and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th shore , that o er his wave worn basis bowed , As stooping to relieve him . I not doubt He came alive to land .
Hearken after their offense , my lord .
Sure , my noble lord , If she be so abandoned to her sorrow As it is spoke , she never will admit me .
Be clamorous , and leap all civil bounds , Rather than make unprofited return .
Officers , what offense have these men done
Say I do speak with her , my lord , what then
Marry , sir , they have committed false report moreover , they have spoken untruths secondarily , they are slanders sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady thirdly , they have verified unjust things and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .
O , then unfold the passion of my love , Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith It shall become thee well to act my woes She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect .
First , I ask thee what they have done thirdly , I ask thee what’s their offense sixth and lastly , why they are committed and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .
I think not so , my lord .
Rightly reasoned , and in his own division and , by my troth , there’s one meaning well suited .
Who have you offended , masters , that you are thus bound to your answer This learned constable is too cunning to be understood . What’s your offense
Dear lad , believe it . For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man . Diana’s lip Is not more smooth and rubious . Thy small pipe Is as the maiden’s organ , shrill and sound , And all is semblative a woman’s part . I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair . Prosper well in this , And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord , To call his fortunes thine .
I’ll do my best To woo your lady Yet , a barful strife Whoe er I woo , myself would be his wife .
Sweet Prince , let me go no farther to mine answer . Do you hear me , and let this count kill me . I have deceived even your very eyes . What your wisdoms could not discover , these shallow fools have brought to light , who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero , how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s garments , how you disgraced her when you should marry her . My villainy they have upon record , which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame . The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation . And , briefly , I desire nothing but the reward of a villain .
Who sets me else by heaven , I’ll throw at all I have a thousand spirits in one breast , To answer twenty thousand such as you .
My Lord Fitzwater , I do remember well The very time Aumerle and you did talk .
’Tis very true you were in presence then And you can witness with me this is true .
As false , by heaven , as heaven itself is true .
Surrey , thou liest .
Dishonourable boy That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword , That it shall render vengeance and revenge Till thou the lie giver and that lie do lie In earth as quiet as thy father’s skull In proof whereof , there is my honour’s pawn Engage it to the trial , if thou darest .
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse If I dare eat , or drink , or breathe , or live , I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness , And spit upon him , whilst I say he lies , And lies , and lies there is my bond of faith , To tie thee to my strong correction . As I intend to thrive in this new world , Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal Besides , I heard the banish’d Norfolk say That thou , Aumerle , didst send two of thy men To execute the noble duke at Calais .
He will recover straight . When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you .
How is it , general Have you not hurt your head
Dost thou mock me
I mock you not , by heaven . Would you would bear your fortune like a man
A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast .
There’s many a beast then in a populous city , And many a civil monster .
Did he confess it
Good sir , be a man , Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked May draw with you . There’s millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar . Your case is better . Oh , ’tis the spite of hell , the fiend’s arch mock , To lip a wanton in a secure couch , And to suppose her chaste . No , let me know , And knowing what I am , I know what she shall be .
Oh , thou art wise Tis certain .
Stand you awhile apart , Confine yourself but in a patient list . Whilst you were here o erwhelmèd with your grief A passion most resulting such a man Cassio came hither . I shifted him away And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy ,
Go , go , up to the leads . The Lord Mayor knocks .
Welcome , my lord . I dance attendance here . I think the duke will not be spoke withal .
Then show it me .
Had I a glass , I would .
Now , Catesby , what says your lord to my request
What , you mean my face
Well aimed of such a young one .
Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you .
He doth entreat your Grace , my noble lord , To visit him tomorrow or next day . He is within , with two right reverend fathers , Divinely bent to meditation , And in no worldly suits would he be moved To draw him from his holy exercise .
Return , good Catesby , to the gracious duke . Tell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , No less importing than our general good , In deep designs , and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace .
I’ll signify so much unto him straight .
The gray eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels . Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious juicèd flowers . The earth , that’s nature’s mother , is her tomb . What is her burying , grave that is her womb . And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different . Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities . For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give . Nor aught so good but , strained from that fair use Revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse . Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power . For this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part Being tasted , stays all senses with the heart . Two such opposèd kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs grace and rude will .
Yet you are withered .
Tis with cares .
I care not .
Nay , hear you , Kate in sooth you ’scape not so .
I chafe you , if I tarry . Let me go .
No , not a whit . I find you passing gentle . Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen , And now I find report a very liar . For thou are pleasant , gamesome , passing courteous , But slow in speech , yet sweet as springtime flowers . Thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will , Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk . But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers , With gentle conference , soft and affable . Why does the world report that Kate doth limp
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage That Norfolk lies here do I throw down this , If he may be repeal’d , to try his honour .
These differences shall all rest under gage Till Norfolk be repeal’d repeal’d he shall be , And , though mine enemy , restored again To all his lands and signories when he’s return’d , Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial .
That honourable day shall ne’er be seen . Many a time hath banish’d Norfolk fought For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field , Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross Against black pagans , Turks , and Saracens And toil’d with works of war , retired himself To Italy and there at Venice gave His body to that pleasant country’s earth , And his pure soul unto his captain Christ , Under whose colours he had fought so long .
Why , bishop , is Norfolk dead
As surely as I live , my lord .
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom Of good old Abraham Lords appellants , Your differences shall all rest under gage Till we assign you to your days of trial .
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it .
But did my brother set thee on to this
Yea , and paid me richly for the practice of it .
He is composed and framed of treachery , And fled he is upon this villainy .
Sweet Hero , now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first .
Come , bring away the plaintiffs . By this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter . And , masters , do not forget to specify , when time and place shall serve , that I am an ass .
Here , here comes Master Signior Leonato , and the Sexton too .
Which is the villain Let me see his eyes , That , when I note another man like him , I may avoid him . Which of these is he
If you would know your wronger , look on me .
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child
No , no , he’s gone .
Sir , you may thank yourself for this great loss , That would not bless our Europe with your daughter , But rather loose her to an African , Where she at least is banished from your eye , Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t .
Prithee , peace .
Bade him anon return and here speak with me , The which he promised . Do but encave yourself , And mark the fleers , the gibes , and notable scorns That dwell in every region of his face . For I will make him tell the tale anew Where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when He hath , and is again to cope your wife . I say , but mark his gesture . Marry , patience , Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen , And nothing of a man .
Dost thou hear , Iago I will be found most cunning in my patience , But dost thou hear most bloody .
That’s not amiss , But yet keep time in all . Will you withdraw
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca , A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes . It is a creature That dotes on Cassio , as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one . He , when he hears of her , cannot refrain From the excess of laughter . Here he comes .
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad . And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles , gestures , and light behavior Quite in the wrong . How do you now , lieutenant
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us , and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience , at Which end o th beam should bow . We have lost your son , I fear , forever . Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business making Than we bring men to comfort them . The fault’s your own .
So is the dearest o th loss .
My lord Sebastian , The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in . You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster .
Very well .
And most chirurgeonly .
It is foul weather in us all , good sir , When you are cloudy .
Nay , either tell me where thou hast been , or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse . My lady will hang thee for thy absence .
Let her hang me . He that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors .
Make that good .
He shall see none to fear .
A good lenten answer . I can tell thee where that saying was born , of I fear no colors .
Where , good Mistress Mary
In the wars . And that may you be bold to say in your foolery .
Well , God give them wisdom that have it . And those that are fools , let them use their talents .
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent . Or to be turned away , is not that as good as a hanging to you
Great Duke of Lancaster , I come to thee From plume pluck’d Richard who with willing soul Adopts thee heir , and his high sceptre yields To the possession of thy royal hand Ascend his throne , descending now from him And long live Henry , fourth of that name
In God’s name , I’ll ascend the regal throne .
Marry . God forbid Worst in this royal presence may I speak , Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth . Would God that any in this noble presence Were enough noble to be upright judge Of noble Richard then true noblesse would Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong . What subject can give sentence on his king And who sits here that is not Richard’s subject Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear , Although apparent guilt be seen in them And shall the figure of God’s majesty , His captain , steward , deputy elect , Anointed , crowned , planted many years , Be judged by subject and inferior breath , And he himself not present O , forfend it , God , That in a Christian climate souls refined Should show so heinous , black , obscene a deed I speak to subjects , and a subject speaks , Stirr’d up by God , thus boldly for his king My Lord of Hereford here , whom you call king , Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford’s king And if you crown him , let me prophesy The blood of English shall manure the ground , And future ages groan for this foul act Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels , And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound Disorder , horror , fear and mutiny Shall here inhabit , and this land be call’d The field of Golgotha and dead men’s skulls . O , if you raise this house against this house , It will the woefullest division prove That ever fell upon this cursed earth . Prevent it , resist it , let it not be so , Lest child , child’s children , cry against you woe
The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
Good morrow , Father .
Ply Desdemona well , and you are sure on ’t . Now if this suit lay in Bianca’s power How quickly should you speed
Alas , poor caitiff
Benedicite . What early tongue so sweet saluteth me Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed . Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie . But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign . Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature . Or if not so , then here I hit it right Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .
Look how he laughs already
That last is true . The sweeter rest was mine .
O slanderous world Kate like the hazel twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts , and sweeter than the kernels . Oh , let me see thee walk Thou dost not halt .
I never knew woman love man so .
Go , fool , and whom thou keep’st command .
God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father No . I have forgot that name and that name’s woe .
Alas , poor rogue , I think indeed she loves me .
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait Oh , be thou Dian , and let her be Kate , And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful .
Now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .
That’s my good son . But where hast thou been , then
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again . I have been feasting with mine enemy , Where on a sudden one hath wounded me , That’s by me wounded . Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies . I bear no hatred , blessèd man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
Where did you study all this goodly speech
It is extempore , from my mother wit .
A witty mother Witless else her son .
Am I not wise
Yes , keep you warm .
Marry , so I mean , sweet Katherine , in thy bed . And therefore , setting all this chat aside , Thus in plain terms your father hath consented That you shall be my wife , your dowry greed on , And , will you , nill you , I will marry you . Now , Kate , I am a husband for your turn , For , by this light , whereby I see thy beauty , Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well , Thou must be married to no man but me . For I am he am born to tame you , Kate , And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates .
Do you hear , Cassio
Ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an Edward He is not lolling on a lewd love bed , But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtesans , But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping , to engross his idle body , But praying , to enrich his watchful soul . Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof . But sure I fear we shall not win him to it .
Marry , God defend his grace should say us nay
I fear he will . Here Catesby comes again .
Now , Catesby , what says his grace
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him , His grace not being warned thereof before . He fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .
Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him . By heaven , we come to him in perfect love , And so once more return and tell his grace .
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads , ’tis much to draw them thence , So sweet is zealous contemplation .
Now he importunes him To tell it o er . Go to , well said , well said .
She gives it out that you shall marry her . Do you intend it
Ha , ha , ha
Do ye triumph , Roman Do you triumph
I marry her What A customer Prithee bear some charity to my wit . Do not think it so unwholesome . Ha , ha , ha
So , so , so , so They laugh that win
Yea , even I alone .
No , not so , villain , thou beliest thyself . Here stand a pair of honorable men A third is fled that had a hand in it . I thank you , princes , for my daughter’s death . Record it with your high and worthy deeds . Twas bravely done , if you bethink you of it .
I know not how to pray your patience , Yet I must speak . Choose your revenge yourself . Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin . Yet sinned I not But in mistaking .
By my soul , nor I , And yet to satisfy this good old man I would bend under any heavy weight That he’ll enjoin me to .
Well have you argued , sir and , for your pains , Of capital treason we arrest you here . My Lord of Westminster , be it your charge To keep him safely till his day of trial . May it please you , lords , to grant the commons’ suit .
Fetch hither Richard , that in common view He may surrender so we shall proceed Without suspicion .
I will be his conduct .
Lords , you that here are under our arrest , Procure your sureties for your days of answer . Little are we beholding to your love , And little look’d for at your helping hands .
Alack , why am I sent for to a king , Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign’d I hardly yet have learn’d To insinuate , flatter , bow , and bend my limbs Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me To this submission . Yet I well remember The favours of these men were they not mine Did they not sometime cry , ‘all hail ’ to me So Judas did to Christ but he , in twelve , Found truth in all but one I , in twelve thousand , none . God save the king Will no man say amen Am I both priest and clerk well then , amen . God save the king although I be not he And yet , amen , if heaven do think him me . To do what service am I sent for hither
Foul weather
Very foul .
Had I plantation of this isle , my lord
He’d sow ’t with nettle seed .
Or docks , or mallows .
And were the king on ’t , what would I do
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live That were impossible but , I pray you both , Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died . And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention , Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones . Sing it tonight . Tomorrow morning come you to my house , And since you could not be my son in law , Be yet my nephew . My brother hath a daughter , Almost the copy of my child that’s dead , And she alone is heir to both of us . Give her the right you should have given her cousin , And so dies my revenge .
Scape being drunk for want of wine .
I th commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things . For no kind of traffic Would I admit . No name of magistrate . Letters should not be known . Riches , poverty , And use of service none . Contract , succession , Bourn , bound of land , tilth , vineyard none . No use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil . No occupation . All men idle , all . And women too , but innocent and pure . No sovereignty
Yet he would be king on ’t .
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning .
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor . Treason , felony , Sword , pike , knife , gun , or need of any engine , Would I not have . But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison , all abundance , To feed my innocent people .
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage , and , for turning away , let summer bear it out .
You are resolute , then
Not so , neither , but I am resolved on two points .
That if one break , the other will hold . Or , if both break , your gaskins fall .
Apt , in good faith , very apt . Well , go thy way . If Sir Toby would leave drinking , thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria .
Peace , you rogue , no more o that . Here comes my lady . Make your excuse wisely , you were best .
Wit , an ’t be thy will , put me into good fooling Those wits , that think they have thee , do very oft prove fools . And I , that am sure I lack thee , may pass for a wise man . For what says Quinapalus Better a witty fool , than a foolish wit .
God bless thee , lady
Be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift . Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet . As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage . When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I’ll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray That thou consent to marry us today .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes . Jesu Maria , what a deal of brine Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline How much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears . Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet . If e er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline . And art thou changed Pronounce this sentence then Women may fall when there’s no strength in men .
Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
And badest me bury love .
Here comes your father . Never make denial . I must and will have Katherine to my wife .
Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter
How but well , sir How but well It were impossible I should speed amiss .
Why , how now , daughter Katherine In your dumps
Call you me daughter Now , I promise you You have showed a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic , A mad cup ruffian and a swearing Jack , That thinks with oaths to face the matter out .
Father , ’tis thus yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her . If she be curst , it is for policy , For she’s not froward , but modest as the dove . She is not hot , but temperate as the morn . For patience she will prove a second Grissel , And Roman Lucrece for her chastity . And to conclude , we have greed so well together , That upon Sunday is the wedding day .
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first .
Hark , Petruchio she says she’ll see thee hanged first .
No marrying ’mong his subjects
None , man . All idle . Whores and knaves .
I would with such perfection govern , sir , T excel the Golden Age .
To do that office of thine own good will Which tired majesty did make thee offer , The resignation of thy state and crown To Henry Bolingbroke .
Save his majesty
Give me the crown . Here , cousin , seize the crown Here cousin On this side my hand , and on that side yours . Now is this golden crown like a deep well That owes two buckets , filling one another , The emptier ever dancing in the air , The other down , unseen and full of water That bucket down and full of tears am I , Drinking my griefs , whilst you mount up on high .
Long live Gonzalo
I thought you had been willing to resign .
And do you mark me , sir
Prithee , no more . Thou dost talk nothing to me .
My crown I am but still my griefs are mine You may my glories and my state depose , But not my griefs still am I king of those .
I do well believe your highness , and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen , who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing .
Part of your cares you give me with your crown .
Take the fool away .
Do you not hear , fellows Take away the lady .
Twas you we laughed at .
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down . My care is loss of care , by old care done Your care is gain of care , by new care won The cares I give I have , though given away They tend the crown , yet still with me they stay .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
I pray thee , chide not . Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow . The other did not so .
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you . So you may continue and laugh at nothing still .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell . But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I’ll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households rancor to pure love .
What a blow was there given
Oh , let us hence . I stand on sudden haste .
An it had not fallen flat long .
Go to , you’re a dry fool . I’ll no more of you . Besides , you grow dishonest .
Wisely and slow . They stumble that run fast .
Why the cry goes that you shall marry her .
Prithee say true
I am a very villain else .
Have you scored me Well .
This is the monkey’s own giving out . She is persuaded I will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .
Iago beckons me . Now he begins the story .
She was here even now . She haunts me in every place . I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck
Crying O dear Cassio as it were . His gesture imports it .
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me , so shakes , and pulls me Ha , ha , ha
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber . Oh , I see that nose of yours , but not that dog I shall throw it to .
Well , I must leave her company .
Before me Look , where she comes .
You are gentlemen of brave mettle . You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
Two faults , madonna , that drink and good counsel will amend . For give the dry fool drink , then is the fool not dry . Bid the dishonest man mend himself . If he mend , he is no longer dishonest . If he cannot , let the botcher mend him . Anything that’s mended is but patched . Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue . If that this simple syllogism will serve , so . If it will not , what remedy As there is no true cuckold but calamity , so beauty’s a flower . The lady bade take away the fool . Therefore , I say again , take her away .
Sir , I bade them take away you .
Misprision in the highest degree Lady , Cucullus non facit monachum that’s as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain . Good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
Can you do it
Dexterously , good madonna .
See where his Grace stands , ’tween two clergymen .
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince , To stay him from the fall of vanity And , see , a book of prayer in his hand , True ornaments to know a holy man . Famous Plantagenet , most gracious prince , Lend favorable ears to our requests , And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal .
My lord , there needs no such apology . I do beseech your Grace pardon me , Who , earnest in the service of my God , Deferred the visitation of my friends . But , leaving this , what is your Grace’s pleasure
Even that , I hope , which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungoverned isle .
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city’s eye , And that you come to reprehend my ignorance .
You have , my lord . Would it might please your Grace , On our entreaties , to amend your fault .
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land
O noble sir Your overkindness doth wring tears from me . I do embrace your offer and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio .
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming . Tonight I take my leave . This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret , Who I believe was packed in all this wrong , Hired to it by your brother .
No , by my soul , she was not , Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me , But always hath been just and virtuous In any thing that I do know by her .
Moreover , sir , which indeed is not under white and black , this plaintiff here , the offender , did call me ass . I beseech you , let it be remembered in his punishment . And also the watch heard them talk of one Deformed . They say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in God’s name , the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard hearted and will lend nothing for God’s sake . Pray you , examine him upon that point .
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth , and I praise God for you .
There’s for thy pains .
Is this your speeding Nay , then , good night our part .
Be patient , gentlemen . I choose her for myself . If she and I be pleased , what’s that to you Tis bargained ’twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company . I tell you , ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me . O , the kindest Kate She hung about my neck , and kiss on kiss She vied so fast , protesting oath on oath , That in a twink she won me to her love . O , you are novices Tis a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew . Give me thy hand , Kate . I will unto Venice To buy apparel gainst the wedding day . Provide the feast , father , and bid the guests . I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine .
I know not what to say , but give me your hands . God send you joy , Petruchio . Tis a match .
Amen , say we . We will be witnesses .
Father , and wife , and gentlemen , adieu . I will to Venice . Sunday comes apace . We will have rings , and things , and fine array , And kiss me , Kate . We will be married o Sunday .
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly
Faith , gentlemen , now I play a merchant’s part , And venture madly on a desperate mart .
Tis such another fitchew . Marry , a perfumed one . What do you mean by this haunting of me
Let the devil and his dam haunt you What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now I was a fine fool to take it . I must take out the work A likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there This is some minx’s token , and I must take out the work There , give it your hobby horse . Wheresoever you had it , I’ll take out no work on ’t .
How now , my sweet Bianca How now , how now
By heaven , that should be my handkerchief
If you’ll come to supper tonight , you may . If you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
After her , after her .
Make your proof .
I must , she’ll rail in the street else .
I must catechise you for it , madonna . Good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
Well , sir , for want of other idleness , I’ll bide your proof .
Will you sup there
Yes , I intend so .
Good madonna , why mournest thou
Well , I may chance to see you , for I would very fain speak with you .
Prithee come , will you
Go to Say no more .
Good fool , for my brother’s death .
I think his soul is in hell , madonna .
I know his soul is in heaven , fool .
The more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven . Take away the fool , gentlemen .
What think you of this fool , Malvolio Doth he not mend
Yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him . Infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
God send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
How say you to that , Malvolio
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal . I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
Where the devil should this Romeo be Came he not home tonight
Not to his father’s . I spoke with his man .
Why , that same pale hard hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father’s house .
A challenge , on my life .
Romeo will answer it .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .
Nay , he will answer the letter’s master , how he dares , being dared .
Alas , poor Romeo He is already dead , stabbed with a white wench’s black eye , shot through the ear with a love song , the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow boy’s butt shaft . And is he a man to encounter Tybalt
Why , what is Tybalt
More than Prince of Cats . Oh , he’s the courageous captain of compliments . He fights as you sing prick song , keeps time , distance , and proportion . He rests his minim rests one , two , and the third in your bosom . The very butcher of a silk button , a duelist , a duelist , a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause . Ah , the immortal passado , the punto reverso , the hai
We would so , and then go a batfowling .
Nay , good my lord , be not angry .
No , I warrant you . I will not adventure my discretion so weakly . Will you laugh me asleep , for I am very heavy
Go sleep , and hear us .
What , all so soon asleep I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts . I find They are inclined to do so .
Please you , sir , Do not omit the heavy offer of it . It seldom visits sorrow . When it doth , It is a comforter .
We two , my lord , Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety .
Thank you . Wondrous heavy .
Are you contented to resign the crown
Know , then , it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat , the throne majestical , The sceptered office of your ancestors , Your state of fortune , and your due of birth , The lineal glory of your royal house , To the corruption of a blemished stock , Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts , Which here we waken to our country’s good , The noble isle doth want her proper limbs Her face defaced with scars of infamy , Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants , And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion Which to recure , we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land , Not as Protector , steward , substitute , Or lowly factor for another’s gain , But as successively , from blood to blood , Your right of birth , your empery , your own . For this , consorted with the citizens , Your very worshipful and loving friends , And by their vehement instigation , In this just suit come I to move your Grace .
Ay , no no , ay for I must nothing be Therefore no no , for I resign to thee . Now mark me , how I will undo myself I give this heavy weight from off my head And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand , The pride of kingly sway from out my heart With mine own tears I wash away my balm , With mine own hands I give away my crown , With mine own tongue deny my sacred state , With mine own breath release all duty’s rites All pomp and majesty I do forswear My manors , rents , revenues I forego My acts , decrees , and statutes I deny God pardon all oaths that are broke to me God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee Make me , that nothing have , with nothing grieved , And thou with all pleased , that hast all achieved Long mayst thou live in Richard’s seat to sit , And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit God save King Harry , unking’d Richard says , And send him many years of sunshine days What more remains
I cannot tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition . If not to answer , you might haply think Tongue tied ambition , not replying , yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , Which fondly you would here impose on me . If to reprove you for this suit of yours , So seasoned with your faithful love to me , Then on the other side I checked my friends . Therefore , to speak , and to avoid the first , And then , in speaking , not to incur the last , Definitively thus I answer you Your love deserves my thanks , but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request . First , if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth , Yet so much is my poverty of spirit , So mighty and so many my defects , That I would rather hide me from my greatness , Being a bark to brook no mighty sea , Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered . But , God be thanked , there is no need of me , And much I need to help you , were there need . The royal tree hath left us royal fruit , Which , mellowed by the stealing hours of time , Will well become the seat of majesty , And make , no doubt , us happy by his reign . On him I lay what you would lay on me , The right and fortune of his happy stars , Which God defend that I should wring from him .
What a strange drowsiness possesses them
God save the foundation
It is the quality o th climate .
Go , I discharge thee of thy prisoner , and I thank thee .
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship , which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself , for the example of others . God keep your Worship I wish your Worship well . God restore you to health I humbly give you leave to depart , and if a merry meeting may be wished , God prohibit it Come , neighbor .
Until tomorrow morning , lords , farewell .
Farewell , my lords . We look for you tomorrow .
We will not fail .
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero .
Bring you these fellows on . We’ll talk with Margaret , How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow .
has no more brain than a stone . Look you now , he’s out of his guard already . Unless you laugh and minister occasion to him , he is gagged . I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools zanies .
Oh , you are sick of self love , Malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite . To be generous , guiltless , and of free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets . There is no slander in an allowed fool , though he do nothing but rail . Nor no railing in a known discreet man , though he do nothing but reprove .
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools
Madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .
From the Count Orsino , is it
I know not , madam . Tis a fair young man , and well attended .
Who of my people hold him in delay
Sir Toby , madam , your kinsman .
Fetch him off , I pray you . He speaks nothing but madman . Fie on him
The what
The pox of such antic , lisping , affecting fantasmines , these new tuners of accents By Jesu , a very good blade A very tall man A very good whore Why , is not this a lamentable thing , grandsire , that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies , these fashion mongers , these pardon me’s , who stand so much on the new form , that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench Oh , their bones , their bones
Here comes Romeo , here comes Romeo .
Without his roe , like a dried herring . O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in . Laura to his lady was but a kitchen wench marry , she had a better love to berhyme her Dido a dowdy , Cleopatra a gypsy , Helen and Hero hildings and harlots , Thisbe a grey eye or so , but not to the purpose . Signior Romeo , bonjour There’s a French salutation to your French slop . You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink I find not Myself disposed to sleep .
Nor I . My spirits are nimble . They fell together all , as by consent . They dropped , as by a thunderstroke . What might , Worthy Sebastian , O , what might No more . And yet methinks I see it in thy face , What thou shouldst be . Th occasion speaks thee , and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head .
What , art thou waking
Do you not hear me speak
I do , and surely It is a sleepy language , and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep . What is it thou didst say This is a strange repose , to be asleep With eyes wide open , standing , speaking , moving , And yet so fast asleep .
Noble Sebastian , Thou let’st thy fortune sleep die , rather wink’st Whiles thou art waking .
Thou dost snore distinctly . There’s meaning in thy snores .
Twas a commodity lay fretting by you . Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas .
The gain I seek is quiet in the match .
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch . But now , Baptista , to your younger daughter . Now is the day we long have lookèd for . I am your neighbor , and was suitor first .
And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess .
Youngling , thou canst not love so dear as I .
Graybeard , thy love doth freeze .
But thine doth fry . Skipper , stand back . Tis age that nourisheth .
But youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth .
Content you , gentlemen . I will compound this strife . Tis deeds must win the prize , and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca’s love . Say , Signior Gremio , what can you assure her
How shall I murder him , Iago
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
O Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was that mine
Yours by this hand . And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife She gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
I would have him nine years a killing . A fine woman A fair woman A sweet woman
Nay , you must forget that .
Ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live . No , my heart is turned to stone . I strike it and it hurts my hand . Oh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks .
Nay , that’s not your way .
Hang her I do but say what she is . So delicate with her needle , an admirable musician . Oh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear Of so high and plenteous wit and invention
She’s the worse for all this .
Go you , Malvolio . If it be a suit from the count , I am sick , or not at home . What you will , to dismiss it .
Now you see , sir , how your fooling grows old , and people dislike it .
Thou hast spoke for us , madonna , as if thy eldest son should be a fool , whose skull Jove cram with brains , for here he comes one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater .
By mine honor , half drunk . What is he at the gate , cousin
A gentleman .
A gentleman What gentleman
Tis a gentleman here a plague o these pickle herring How now , sot
Good Sir Toby
Cousin , cousin , how have you come so early by this lethargy
Pray thee , sweet Mistress Margaret , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice .
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty
In so high a style , Margaret , that no man living shall come over it , for in most comely truth thou deservest it .
To have no man come over me Why , shall I always keep below stairs
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth it catches .
And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils , which hit but hurt not .
A most manly wit , Margaret , it will not hurt a woman . And so , I pray thee , call Beatrice . I give thee the bucklers .
Give us the swords we have bucklers of our own .
If you use them , Margaret , you must put in the pikes with a vice , and they are dangerous weapons for maids .
Well , I will call Beatrice to you , who I think hath legs .
First , as you know , my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold , Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry , In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns , In cypress chests my arras counterpoints , Costly apparel , tents , and canopies , Fine linen , Turkey cushions bossed with pearl , Valance of Venice gold in needlework , Pewter and brass , and all things that belong To house or housekeeping . Then , at my farm I have a hundred milch kine to the pail , Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , And all things answerable to this portion . Myself am struck in years , I must confess , And if I die tomorrow this is hers , If whilst I live she will be only mine .
Sir , list to me I am my father’s heir and only son . If I may have your daughter to my wife , I’ll leave her houses three or four as good , Within rich Pisa walls , as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua , Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land , all which shall be her jointure . What , have I pinched you , Signior Gremio
Two thousand ducats by the year of land What , have I choked you with an argosy
I am more serious than my custom . You Must be so too if heed me , which to do Trebles thee o er .
Well , I am standing water .
I’ll teach you how to flow .
Do so . To ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me .
Oh , If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it How , in stripping it , You more invest it Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth .
Lechery I defy lechery . There’s one at the gate .
Ay , marry , what is he
Let him be the devil , an he will , I care not . Give me faith , say I . Well , it’s all one .
Prithee , say on . The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee , and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield .
Thus , sir Although this lord of weak remembrance this , Who shall be of as little memory When he is earthed hath here almost persuade the king his son’s alive , Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned And he that sleeps here swims .
Good morrow to you both . What counterfeit did I give you
The slip , sir , the slip . Can you not conceive
Pardon , good Mercutio , my business was great , and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .
That’s as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
Meaning to curtsy
Thou hast most kindly hit it .
A most courteous exposition .
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
Pink for flower .
Right .
What’s a drunken man like , fool
Oh , a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition
Ay , too gentle .
Like a drowned man , a fool and a madman . One draught above heat makes him a fool , the second mads him , and a third drowns him .
No more , but that you read These accusations and these grievous crimes Committed by your person and your followers Against the state and profit of this land That , by confessing them , the souls of men May deem that you are worthily deposed .
Nay , that’s certain . But yet the pity of it , Iago O Iago , the pity of it , Iago
If you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend , for if it touch not you it comes near nobody .
I will chop her into messes Cuckold me
Oh , ’tis foul in her .
With mine officer
That’s fouler .
Get me some poison , Iago , this night . I’ll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This night , Iago
My lord , this argues conscience in your Grace , But the respects thereof are nice and trivial , All circumstances well considerèd . You say that Edward is your brother’s son So say we too , but not by Edward’s wife . For first was he contract to Lady Lucy Your mother lives a witness to that vow And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona , sister to the king of France . These both put off , a poor petitioner , A care crazed mother to a many sons , A beauty waning and distressèd widow , Even in the afternoon of her best days , Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy . By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward , whom our manners term the Prince . More bitterly could I expostulate , Save that , for reverence to some alive , I give a sparing limit to my tongue . Then , good my lord , take to your royal self This proffered benefit of dignity , If not to bless us and the land withal , Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal , true derivèd course .
Do it not with poison . Strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
Good , good , the justice of it pleases Very good
And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker . You shall hear more by midnight .
Excellent good .
Go thou and seek the crowner , and let him sit o my coz . For he’s in the third degree of drink , he’s drowned . Go look after him .
Must I do so and must I ravel out My weaved up folly Gentle Northumberland , If thy offences were upon record , Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst , There shouldst thou find one heinous article , Containing the deposing of a king And cracking the strong warrant of an oath , Mark’d with a blot , damn’d in the book of heaven Nay , all of you that stand and look upon , Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself , Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates Have here deliver’d me to my sour cross , And water cannot wash away your sin .
He is but mad yet , madonna , and the fool shall look to the madman .
My lord , dispatch read o’er these articles .
Mine eyes are full of tears , I cannot see And yet salt water blinds them not so much But they can see a sort of traitors here . Nay , if I turn mine eyes upon myself , I find myself a traitor with the rest For I have given here my soul’s consent To undeck the pompous body of a king Made glory base and sovereignty a slave , Proud majesty a subject , state a peasant .
Madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you . I told him you were sick . He takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you . I told him you were asleep . He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you . What is to be said to him , lady He’s fortified against any denial .
Gremio , ’tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies , besides two galliasses , And twelve tight galleys . These I will assure her , And twice as much whate er thou offer’st next .
Nay , I have offered all , I have no more , And she can have no more than all I have . If you like me , she shall have me and mine .
Why , then the maid is mine from all the world , By your firm promise . Gremio is outvied .
I must confess your offer is the best , And , let your father make her the assurance , She is your own else , you must pardon me . If you should die before him , where’s her dower
That’s but a cavil he is old , I young .
And may not young men die as well as old
Well , gentlemen , I am thus resolved On Sunday next , you know My daughter Katherina is to be married . Now , on the Sunday following , shall Bianca Be bride to you , if you make this assurance . If not , to Signior Gremio . And so I take my leave , and thank you both .
Why , then is my pump well flowered .
Sure wit , follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump , that when the single sole of it is worn , the jest may remain , after the wearing solely singular .
O single soled jest , solely singular for the singleness .
Come between us , good Benvolio . My wits faints .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I’ll cry a match .
Nay , if our wits run the wild goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five . Was I with you there for the goose
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
Nay , good goose , bite not .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting . It is a most sharp sauce .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose
Oh , here’s a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad
My lord ,
No lord of thine , thou haught insulting man , Nor no man’s lord I have no name , no title , No , not that name was given me at the font , But ’tis usurp’d alack the heavy day , That I have worn so many winters out , And know not now what name to call myself O that I were a mockery king of snow , Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke , To melt myself away in water drops Good king , great king , and yet not greatly good , An if my word be sterling yet in England , Let it command a mirror hither straight , That it may show me what a face I have , Since it is bankrupt of his majesty .
Go some of you and fetch a looking glass .
Read o’er this paper while the glass doth come .
Fiend , thou torment’st me ere I come to hell
Urge it no more , my Lord Northumberland .
The commons will not then be satisfied .
They shall be satisfied I’ll read enough , When I do see the very book indeed Where all my sins are writ , and that’s myself .
I stretch it out for that word broad , which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
Adieu , good neighbor .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love Now art thou sociable . Now art thou Romeo . Now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature , for this driveling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole .
Now I fear thee not . Sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table . Tut , a toy An old Italian fox is not so kind , my boy .
Stop there , stop there .
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair .
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide Yet I have faced it with a card of ten . Tis in my head to do my master good . I see no reason but supposed Lucentio Must get a father , called supposed Vincentio And that’s a wonder . Fathers commonly Do get their children . But in this case of wooing , A child shall get a sire , if I fail not of my cunning .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
Oh , thou art deceived . I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
Here’s goodly gear .
A sail , a sail
Two , two a shirt and a smock .
Peter
What trumpet is that same
I warrant something from Venice . Tis Lodovico , this , comes from the duke . See , your wife’s with him .
Save you , worthy general
With all my heart , sir .
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures .
And what’s the news , good cousin Lodovico
I am very glad to see you , signior . Welcome to Cyprus .
I thank you . How does lieutenant Cassio
Lives , sir .
I have no hope That he’s undrowned .
Oh , out of that no hope What great hope have you No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond , But doubt discovery there . Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned
He’s gone .
Then , tell me , Who’s the next heir of Naples
Claribel .
She that is Queen of Tunis she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man’s life she that from Naples Can have no note , unless the sun were post The man i th moon’s too slow till newborn chins Be rough and razorable she that from whom We all were sea swallowed , though some cast again , And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what’s past is prologue , what to come In yours and my discharge .
What stuff is this How say you Tis true , my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis , So is she heir of Naples , ’twixt which regions There is some space .
A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out , How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis ,
And therefore will come .
The god of love , That sits above , And knows me , and knows me , How pitiful I deserve I mean in singing . But in loving , Leander the good swimmer , Troilus the first employer of panders , and a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmongers , whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse , why , they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love . Marry , I cannot show it in rhyme . I have tried . I can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn , horn a hard rhyme for , school , fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings . No , I was not born under a rhyming planet , nor I cannot woo in festival terms .
Sweet Beatrice , wouldst thou come when I called thee
Yea , Signior , and depart when you bid me .
Oh , stay but till then
Then is spoken . Fare you well now . And yet , ere I go , let me go with that I came , which is , with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio .
Only foul words , and thereupon I will kiss thee .
Cousin , there’s fall n between him and my lord An unkind breach , but you shall make all well .
Are you sure of that
My lord
This fail you not to do , as you will
Anon
My fan , Peter .
Good , Peter , to hide her face , for her fan’s the fairer face .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
God ye good e en , fair gentlewoman .
Is it good e en
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
Out upon you What a man are you
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .
By my troth , it is well said . For himself to mar , quoth he Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him . I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
You say well .
Give me the glass , and therein will I read . No deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck So many blows upon this face of mine , And made no deeper wounds O flattering glass , Like to my followers in prosperity , Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men was this the face That , like the sun , did make beholders wink Was this the face that faced so many follies , And was at last out faced by Bolingbroke A brittle glory shineth in this face As brittle as the glory is the face
For there it is , crack’d in a hundred shivers . Mark , silent king , the moral of this sport , How soon my sorrow hath destroy’d my face .
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy’d The shadow or your face .
Say that again . The shadow of my sorrow ha let’s see ’Tis very true , my grief lies all within And these external manners of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul There lies the substance and I thank thee , king , For thy great bounty , that not only givest Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause . I’ll beg one boon , And then be gone and trouble you no more . Shall I obtain it
Do , good my lord . Your citizens entreat you .
Refuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love .
O , make them joyful . Grant their lawful suit .
Alas , why would you heap this care on me I am unfit for state and majesty . I do beseech you , take it not amiss I cannot , nor I will not , yield to you .
If you refuse it , as in love and zeal Loath to depose the child , your brother’s son As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle , kind , effeminate remorse , Which we have noted in you to your kindred And equally indeed to all estates Yet know whe er you accept our suit or no , Your brother’s son shall never reign our king , But we will plant some other in the throne , To the disgrace and downfall of your house . And in this resolution here we leave you . Come , citizens . Zounds , I’ll entreat no more .
Tell him he shall not speak with me .
Has been told so , and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post , and be the supporter to a bench , but he’ll speak with you .
What kind o man is he
Why , of mankind .
What manner of man
Of very ill manner . He’ll speak with you , will you or no .
Of what personage and years is he
Not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before ’tis a peascod , or a codling when ’tis almost an apple . Tis with him in standing water , between boy and man . He is very well favored , and he speaks very shrewishly . One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him .
Let him approach . Call in my gentlewoman .
Gentlewoman , my lady calls .
Fiddler , forbear . You grow too forward , sir . Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katherina welcomed you withal
Give me my veil . Come , throw it o er my face . We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy .
But , wrangling pedant , this is The patroness of heavenly harmony . Then give me leave to have prerogative , And when in music we have spent an hour , Your lecture shall have leisure for as much .
Preposterous ass , that never read so far To know the cause why music was ordained . Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain Then give me leave to read philosophy And , while I pause , serve in your harmony .
Sirrah , I will not bear these braves of thine .
Why , gentlemen , you do me double wrong To strive for that which resteth in my choice . I am no breeching scholar in the schools . I’ll not be tied to hours nor pointed times But learn my lessons as I please myself . And , to cut off all strife , here sit we down .
Yea , is the worst well Very well took , i faith , wisely , wisely .
If you be he , sir , I desire some confidence with you .
She will indite him to some supper .
A bawd , a bawd , a bawd So ho
What hast thou found
No hare , sir , unless a hare , sir , in a Lenten pie that is , something stale and hoar ere it be spent .

Romeo , will you come to your father’s We’ll to dinner , thither .
I will follow you .
He did not call , he’s busy in the paper . Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio
A most unhappy one . I would do much T atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .
Fire and brimstone
My lord
Are you wise
What , is he angry
Maybe the letter moved him , For , as I think , they do command him home , Deputing Cassio in his government .
Trust me , I am glad on ’t .
Indeed
My lord
I am glad to see you mad .
Name it , fair cousin .
Why , sweet Othello
Devil
I have not deserved this .
‘Fair cousin’ I am greater than a king For when I was a king , my flatterers Were then but subjects being now a subject , I have a king here to my flatterer . Being so great , I have no need to beg .
Yet ask .
And shall I have
You shall .
Then give me leave to go .
Whither
Whither you will , so I were from your sights .
Go , some of you convey him to the Tower .
O , good convey conveyers are you all , That rise thus nimbly by a true king’s fall .
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down Our coronation lords , prepare yourselves .
Foul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome . Therefore I will depart unkissed .
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit . But I must tell thee plainly , Claudio undergoes my challenge , and either I must shortly hear from him , or I will subscribe him a coward . And I pray thee now tell me , for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
A woeful pageant have we here beheld .
The woe’s to come the children yet unborn . Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn .
Take you your instrument , play you the whiles . His lecture will be done ere you have tuned .
You’ll leave his lecture when I am in tune
Tune your instrument .
Where left we last
Here , madam Hic ibat Simois , hic est Sigeia tellus , Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis .
Conster them .
Hic ibat , as I told you before , Simois , I am Lucentio , hic est , son unto Vincentio of Pisa , Sigeia tellus , disguised thus to get your love , Hic steterat , and that Lucentio that comes a wooing , Priami is my man Tranio , regia , bearing my port , celsa senis , that we might beguile the old pantaloon .
Madam , my instrument’s in tune .
Let’s hear . O fie The treble jars .
Spit in the hole , man , and tune again .
For them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them . But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me
You holy clergymen , is there no plot To rid the realm of this pernicious blot
Suffer love A good epithet I do suffer love indeed , for I love thee against my will .
The honorable lady of the house , which is she
Speak to me . I shall answer for her . Your will
Most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty I pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for I never saw her . I would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , I have taken great pains to con it . Good beauties , let me sustain no scorn . I am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
Whence came you , sir
I can say little more than I have studied , and that question’s out of my part . Good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that I may proceed in my speech .
Are you a comedian
No , my profound heart . And yet , by the very fangs of malice I swear , I am not that I play . Are you the lady of the house
If I do not usurp myself , I am .
In spite of your heart , I think . Alas , poor heart , if you spite it for my sake , I will spite it for yours , for I will never love that which my riend hates .
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably .
Most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve . But this is from my commission . I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message .
Farewell , ancient lady . Farewell , lady , lady , lady .
And let Sebastian wake . Say this were death That now hath seized them . Why , they were no worse Than now they are . There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps , lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo . I myself could make A chough of as deep chat . Oh , that you bore The mind that I do , what a sleep were this For your advancement Do you understand me
Methinks I do .
I pray you , sir , what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero .
True . And look how well my garments sit upon me , Much feater than before . My brother’s servants Were then my fellows . Now they are my men .
It appears not in this confession . There’s not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself .
But , for your conscience
An old , an old instance , Beatrice , that lived in the lime of good neighbors . If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps .
And how long is that , think you
Ay , sir . Where lies that If ’twere a kibe , Twould put me to my slipper . But I feel not This deity in my bosom . Twenty consciences , That stand ’twixt me and Milan , candied be they And melt ere they molest Here lies your brother , No better than the earth he lies upon , If he were that which now he’s like that’s dead Whom I , with this obedient steel , three inches of it , Can lay to bed for ever whiles you , doing thus , To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel , this Sir Prudence , who
O , do not swear , my lord of Buckingham
Call them again , sweet prince . Accept their suit . If you deny them , all the land will rue it .
Will you enforce me to a world of cares Call them again . I am not made of stones , But penetrable to your kind entreaties , Albeit against my conscience and my soul .
An he speak any thing against me , I’ll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks . And if I cannot , I’ll find those that shall . Scurvy knave I am none of his flirt gills . I am none of his skains mates . And thou must stand by , too , and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure
Cousin of Buckingham and sage , grave men , Since you will buckle fortune on my back , To bear her burden , whe er I will or no , I must have patience to endure the load But if black scandal or foul faced reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition , Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof , For God doth know , and you may partly see , How far I am from the desire of this .
I saw no man use you at his pleasure . If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you . I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .
God bless your Grace We see it and will say it .
In saying so , you shall but say the truth .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers . Scurvy knave Pray you , sir , a word . And as I told you , my young lady bid me inquire you out . What she bade me say , I will keep to myself . But first let me tell ye , if ye should lead her into a fool’s paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say . For the gentlewoman is young , and therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman , and very weak dealing .
My lord , this would not be believed in Venice , Though I should swear I saw ’t . Tis very much . Make her amends , she weeps .
Now let me see if I can conster it . Hic ibat Simois , I know you not , hic est Sigeia tellus , I trust you not , Hic steterat Priami , take heed he hear us not , regia , presume not , celsa senis , despair not .
Oh , devil , devil If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears , Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile . Out of my sight
Madam , ’tis now in tune .
I will not stay to offend you .
All but the base .
Truly , an obedient lady . I do beseech your lordship , call her back .
How fiery and forward our pedant is Now , for my life , the knave doth court my love . Pedascule , I’ll watch you better yet .
Mistress
In time I may believe , yet I mistrust .
My lord
Mistrust it not , for sure Aeacides Was Ajax , called so from his grandfather .
What would you with her , sir
I must believe my master else , I promise you , I should be arguing still upon that doubt . But let it rest . Now , Litio , to you . Good master , take it not unkindly , pray , That I have been thus pleasant with you both .
Who , I , my lord
You may go walk , and give me leave awhile . My lessons make no music in three parts .
Ay , you did wish that I would make her turn . Sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , And turn again . And she can weep , sir , weep . And she’s obedient , as you say , obedient , Very obedient . Proceed you in your tears . Concerning this , sir Oh , well painted passion I am commanded home . Get you away , I’ll send for you anon . Sir , I obey the mandate And will return to Venice . Hence , avaunt
Come to what is important in ’t . I forgive you the praise .
Alas , I took great pains to study it , and ’tis poetical .
It is the more like to be feigned . I pray you , keep it in . I heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you . If you be not mad , be gone . If you have reason , be brief . Tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue .
Will you hoist sail , sir Here lies your way .
No , good swabber , I am to hull here a little longer . Some mollification for your giant , sweet lady .
Tell me your mind .
I am a messenger .
Sure , you have some hideous matter to deliver , when the courtesy of it is so fearful . Speak your office .
It alone concerns your ear . I bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage . I hold the olive in my hand . My words are as full of peace as matter .
Yet you began rudely . What are you What would you
Should not upbraid our course . For all the rest , They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk . They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour .
Thy case , dear friend , Shall be my precedent . As thou got’st Milan , I’ll come by Naples . Draw thy sword . One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest . And I the king shall love thee .
Draw together . And when I rear my hand , do you the like , To fall it on Gonzalo .
O , but one word .
While you here do snoring lie , Open eyed conspiracy His time doth take . If of life you keep a care , Shake off slumber and beware . Awake , awake
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress . I protest unto thee
Good heart , and i faith , I will tell her as much . Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse Thou dost not mark me .
I will tell her , sir , that you do protest , which , as I take it , is a gentlemanlike offer .
Bid her devise Some means to come to shrift this afternoon . And there she shall at Friar Lawrence cell Be shrived and married . Here is for thy pains .
No , truly , sir . Not a penny .
Go to . I say you shall .
This afternoon , sir Well , she shall be there .
And stay , good Nurse . Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night . Farewell . Be trusty , and I’ll quit thy pains . Farewell . Commend me to thy mistress .
Then I salute you with this royal title Long live Richard , England’s worthy king
Amen .
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned
Even when you please , since you will have it so .
Tomorrow , then , we will attend your Grace , And so most joyfully we take our leave .
Come , let us to our holy task again . Farewell , my cousin . Farewell , gentle friends .
My lord , Before I freely speak my mind herein , You shall not only take the sacrament To bury mine intents , but also to effect Whatever I shall happen to devise . I see your brows are full of discontent , Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears Come home with me to supper and I’ll lay A plot shall show us all a merry day .
Question why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum . Therefore is it most expedient for the wise , if Don Worm , his conscience , find no impediment to the contrary , to be the trumpet of his own virtues , as I am to myself . So much for praising myself , who , I myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy . An now tell me , how doth your cousin
Very ill .
And how do you
Very ill , too .
Serve God , love me , and mend . There will I leave you too , for here comes one in haste .
Madam , you must come to your uncle . Yonder’s old coil at home . It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused , the Prince and Claudio mightily abused , and Don John is the author of all , who is fled and gone . Will you come presently
Will you go hear this news , Signior
I will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes and moreover , I will go with thee to thy uncle’s .
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment . What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead . To your ears , divinity . To any other’s , profanation .
Give us the place alone . We will hear this divinity .
Now , sir , what is your text
Most sweet lady
A comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it . Where lies your text
In Orsino’s bosom .
In his bosom In what chapter of his bosom
To answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
Oh , I have read it . It is heresy . Have you no more to say
Good madam , let me see your face .
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face You are now out of your text . But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture . Look you , sir , such a one I was this present . Is ’t not well done
And watch withal , for , but I be deceived , Our fine musician groweth amorous .
Madam , before you touch the instrument , To learn the order of my fingering I must begin with rudiments of art , To teach you gamut in a briefer sort , More pleasant , pithy , and effectual Than hath been taught by any of my trade . And there it is in writing , fairly drawn .
Why , I am past my gamut long ago .
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio .
Gamut I am , the ground of all accord A re , to plead Hortensio’s passion B mi , Bianca , take him for thy lord , C fa ut , that loves with all affection D sol re , one clef , two notes have I E la mi , show pity , or I die . Call you this gamut Tut , I like it not . Old fashions please me best . I am not so nice To change true rules for old inventions .
Who meets us here My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester Now , for my life , she’s wandering to the Tower , On pure heart’s love , to greet the tender prince . Daughter , well met .
God give your Graces both A happy and a joyful time of day .
As much to you , good sister . Whither away
No farther than the Tower , and , as I guess , Upon the like devotion as yourselves , To gratulate the gentle princes there .
Kind sister , thanks . We’ll enter all together .
And in good time here the lieutenant comes . Master Lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , How doth the prince and my young son of York
Right well , dear madam . By your patience , I may not suffer you to visit them . The king hath strictly charged the contrary .
This way the king will come this is the way To Julius Caesar’s ill erected tower , To whose flint bosom my condemned lord Is doom’d a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke Here let us rest , if this rebellious earth Have any resting for her true king’s queen .
But soft , but see , or rather do not see , My fair rose wither yet look up , behold , That you in pity may dissolve to dew , And wash him fresh again with true love tears . Ah , thou , the model where old Troy did stand , Thou map of honour , thou King Richard’s tomb , And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn , Why should hard favour’d grief be lodged in thee , When triumph is become an alehouse guest
Join not with grief , fair woman , do not so , To make my end too sudden learn , good soul , To think our former state a happy dream From which awaked , the truth of what we are Shows us but this I am sworn brother , sweet , To grim Necessity , and he and I Will keep a league till death . Hie thee to France And cloister thee in some religious house Our holy lives must win a new world’s crown , Which our profane hours here have stricken down .
Cassio shall have my place . And , sir , tonight I do entreat that we may sup together . You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus . Goats and monkeys
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake Whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce
He is much changed .
Are his wits safe Is he not light of brain
He’s that he is . I may not breathe my censure What he might be . If what he might he is not , I would to heaven he were
What Strike his wife
Faith , that was not so well . Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst
Is it his use Or did the letters work upon his blood And new create his fault
Is this the monument of Leonato
It is , my lord .
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies . Death , in guerdon of her wrongs , Gives her fame which never dies . So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame .
Hang thou there upon the tomb , Praising her when I am dumb . Now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn . Pardon , goddess of the night , Those that slew thy virgin knight , For the which with songs of woe Round about her tomb they go . Midnight , assist our moan . Help us to sigh and groan Heavily , heavily . Graves , yawn and yield your dead , Till death be utterèd , Heavily , heavily .
Then let us both be sudden .
Now , good angels preserve the king
Why , how now Ho , awake
Now God in heaven bless thee Hark you , sir .
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse
Why are you drawn Wherefore this ghastly looking
Is your man secret Did you ne er hear say , Two may keep counsel , putting one away
Warrant thee , my man’s as true as steel .
What’s the matter
Whiles we stood here securing your repose , Even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls , or rather lions . Did ’t not wake you It struck mine ear most terribly .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady . Lord , Lord when ’twas a little prating thing . Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him . I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man . But , I’ll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world . Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter
Mistress , your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister’s chamber up . You know tomorrow is the wedding day .
Ay , Nurse , what of that Both with an R .
Farewell , sweet masters both . I must be gone .
I heard nothing .
Faith , mistress , then I have no cause to stay .
Ah , mocker , that’s the dog’s name . R is for the No , I know it begins with some other letter , and she hath the prettiest sententious of it , of you and rosemary , that it would do you good to hear it .
Oh , ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear , To make an earthquake Sure , it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions .
Heard you this , Gonzalo
Commend me to thy lady .
Upon mine honor , sir , I heard a humming , And that a strange one too , which did awake me . I shaked you , sir , and cried . As mine eyes opened , I saw their weapons drawn . There was a noise , That’s verily . Tis best we stand upon our guard , Or that we quit this place . Let’s draw our weapons .
But I have cause to pry into this pedant . Methinks he looks as though he were in love . Yet if thy thoughts , Bianca , be so humble To cast thy wand ring eyes on every stale , Seize thee that list If once I find thee ranging , Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing .
Excellently done , if God did all .
Tis in grain , sir . Twill endure wind and weather .
Tis beauty truly blent , whose red and white Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on . Lady , you are the cruel’st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy .
O , sir , I will not be so hard hearted . I will give out divers schedules of my beauty . It shall be inventoried , and every particle and utensil labeled to my will as , item , two lips indifferent red item , two grey eyes , with lids to them item , one neck , one chin , and so forth . Were you sent hither to praise me
I see you what you are , you are too proud . But , if you were the devil , you are fair . My lord and master loves you . Oh , such love Could be but recompensed though you were crowned The nonpareil of beauty .
How does he love me
With adorations , fertile tears , With groans that thunder love , with sighs of fire .
Your lord does know my mind . I cannot love him . Yet I suppose him virtuous , know him noble , Of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth .
Ay , a thousand times . Peter
Anon
Before and apace .
The king Who’s that
I mean , the Lord Protector .
The Lord protect him from that kingly title Hath he set bounds between their love and me I am their mother . Who shall bar me from them
I am their father’s mother . I will see them .
Their aunt I am in law , in love their mother . Then bring me to their sights . I’ll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee , on my peril .
No , madam , no . I may not leave it so . I am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence , And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker on , of two fair queens . Come , madam , you must straight to Westminster , There to be crownèd Richard’s royal queen .
Ah , cut my lace asunder , That my pent heart may have some scope to beat , Or else I swoon with this dead killing news
Despiteful tidings O , unpleasing news
Be of good cheer , mother . How fares your Grace
What , is my Richard both in shape and mind Transform’d and weaken’d hath Bolingbroke deposed Thine intellect hath he been in thy heart The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw , And wounds the earth , if nothing else , with rage To be o’erpower’d and wilt thou , pupil like , Take thy correction mildly , kiss the rod , And fawn on rage with base humility , Which art a lion and a king of beasts
A king of beasts , indeed if aught but beasts , I had been still a happy king of men . Good sometime queen , prepare thee hence for France Think I am dead and that even here thou takest , As from my death bed , thy last living leave . In winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid And ere thou bid good night , to quit their griefs , Tell thou the lamentable tale of me And send the hearers weeping to their beds For why , the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accent of thy moving tongue And in compassion weep the fire out And some will mourn in ashes , some coal black , For the deposing of a rightful king .
Alas , alas It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known . You shall observe him , And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech . Do but go after And mark how he continues .
I am sorry that I am deceived in him .
Lead off this ground , and let’s make further search For my poor son .
Heavens keep him from these beasts For he is , sure , i th island .
Lead away .
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done . So , King , go safely on to seek thy son .
Now , unto thy bones good night Yearly will I do this rite .
Good morrow , masters . Put your torches out . The wolves have preyed , and look , the gentle day , Before the wheels of Phoebus , round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey . Thanks to you all , and leave us . Fare you well .
Good morrow , masters . Each his several way .
Come , let us hence , and put on other weeds , And then to Leonato’s we will go .
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed ’s Than this for whom we rendered up this woe .
Signior Lucentio , this is the pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married , And yet we hear not of our son in law . What will be said What mockery will it be , To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage What says Lucentio to this shame of ours
O Dorset , speak not to me . Get thee gone . Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels . Thy mother’s name is ominous to children . If thou wilt outstrip death , go , cross the seas , And live with Richmond , from the reach of hell . Go , hie thee , hie thee from this slaughterhouse , Lest thou increase the number of the dead And make me die the thrall of Margaret’s curse , Nor mother , wife , nor England’s counted queen .
Full of wise care is this your counsel , madam . Take all the swift advantage of the hours . You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf , to meet you on the way . Be not ta en tardy by unwise delay .
O ill dispersing wind of misery O my accursèd womb , the bed of death A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world , Whose unavoided eye is murderous .
Come , madam , come . I in all haste was sent .
And I in all unwillingness will go . O , would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red hot steel to sear me to the brains Anointed let me be with deadly venom , And die ere men can say , God save the Queen .
Go , go , poor soul , I envy not thy glory . To feed my humor , wish thyself no harm .
No shame but mine . I must , forsooth , be forced To give my hand , opposed against my heart , Unto a mad brain rudesby , full of spleen , Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure . I told you , I , he was a frantic fool , Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior , And , to be noted for a merry man , He’ll woo a thousand , point the day of marriage , Make friends , invite , and proclaim the banns , Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed . Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say , Lo , there is mad Petruchio’s wife , If it would please him come and marry her
Patience , good Katherine , and Baptista too . Upon my life , Petruchio means but well , Whatever fortune stays him from his word Though he be blunt , I know him passing wise Though he be merry , yet withal he’s honest .
My lord , the mind of Bolingbroke is changed You must to Pomfret , not unto the Tower . And , madam , there is order ta’en for you With all swift speed you must away to France .
Northumberland , thou ladder wherewithal The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne , The time shall not be many hours of age More than it is ere foul sin gathering head Shalt break into corruption thou shalt think , Though he divide the realm and give thee half , It is too little , helping him to all And he shall think that thou , which know’st the way To plant unrightful kings , wilt know again , Being ne’er so little urged , another way To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne . The love of wicked men converts to fear That fear to hate , and hate turns one or both To worthy danger and deserved death .
My guilt be on my head , and there an end . Take leave and part for you must part forthwith .
Doubly divorced Bad men , you violate A twofold marriage , ’twixt my crown and me , And then betwixt me and my married wife . Let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me And yet not so , for with a kiss ’twas made . Part us , Northumberland I toward the north , Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime My wife to France from whence , set forth in pomp , She came adorned hither like sweet May , Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse . In half an hour she promised to return . Perchance she cannot meet him . That’s not so . Oh , she is lame Love’s heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills . Therefore do nimble pinioned doves draw love And therefore hath the wind swift Cupid wings . Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day’s journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come . Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball . My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me . But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
O God , she comes . O honey Nurse , what news Hast thou met with him Send thy man away .
In voices well divulged , free , learned , and valiant And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person . But yet I cannot love him He might have took his answer long ago .
Peter , stay at the gate .
If I did love you in my master’s flame , With such a suffering , such a deadly life , In your denial I would find no sense I would not understand it .
Why , what would you
Now , good sweet Nurse O Lord , why look’st thou sad Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily . If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house . Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night . Halloo your name to the reverberate hills And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out Olivia Oh , you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth , But you should pity me .
You might do much . What is your parentage
Above my fortunes , yet my state is well . I am a gentleman .
Get you to your lord . I cannot love him . Let him send no more Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it . Fare you well . I thank you for your pains . Spend this for me .
All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs , fens , flats , on Prosper fall and make him By inchmeal a disease His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse . But they’ll nor pinch , Fright me with urchin shows , pitch me i th mire , Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way , unless he bid em . But For every trifle are they set upon me , Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me , And after bite me , then like hedgehogs which Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall . Sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness .
Lo , now , lo Here comes a spirit of his , and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly . I’ll fall flat . Perchance he will not mind me .
Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all . And another storm brewing , I hear it sing i th wind . Yond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor . If it should thunder as it did before , I know not where to hide my head . Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls .
You have seen nothing then
Nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
Yes , you have seen Cassio and she together .
But then I saw no harm , and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them .
What , did they never whisper
Never , my lord .
Nor send you out o th way
Never .
To fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing
Never , my lord .
That’s strange .
I durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , Lay down my soul at stake . If you think other Remove your thought , it doth abuse your bosom . If any wretch have put this in your head Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse For if she be not honest , chaste , and true There’s no man happy . The purest of their wives Is foul as slander .
Would Katherine had never seen him , though
Go , girl . I cannot blame thee now to weep , For such an injury would vex a very saint , Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor .
Master , master News , old news , and such news as you never heard of
Is it new and old too How may that be
Why , is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming
Is he come
Why , no , sir .
What then
He is coming .
When will he be here
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
But say , what to thine old news
Did I not tell you she was innocent
So are the Prince and Claudio , who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated . But Margaret was in some fault for this , Although against her will , as it appears In the true course of all the question .
Well , I am glad that all things sort so well .
And so am I , being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it .
Well , daughter , and you gentlewomen all , Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , And when I send for you , come hither masked . The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me . You know your office , brother . You must be father to your brother’s daughter , And give her to young Claudio .
Which I will do with confirmed countenance .
Friar , I must entreat your pains , I think .
To do what , Signior
What have we here A man or a fish Dead or alive A fish . He smells like a fish , a very ancient and fish like smell , a kind of not of the newest poor john . A strange fish Were I in England now , as once I was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver . There would this monster make a man . Any strange beast there makes a man . When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian . Legged like a man and his fins like arms Warm , o my troth . I do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
Alas , the storm is come again My best way is to creep under his gaberdine . There is no other shelter hereabouts . Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows . I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
The master , the swabber , the boatswain , and I , The gunner and his mate Loved Mall , Meg , and Marian , and Margery , But none of us cared for Kate . For she had a tongue with a tang ,
Bid her come hither . Go .
She says enough , yet she’s a simple bawd That cannot say as much . This is a subtle whore , A closet , lock and key , of villainous secrets . And yet she’ll kneel and pray , I have seen her do ’t .
My lord , what is your will
Pray , chuck , come hither .
What is your pleasure
Let me see your eyes . Look in my face .
What horrible fancy’s this
Some of your function , mistress , Leave procreants alone and shut the door . Cough or cry hem if any body come . Your mystery , your mystery Nay , dispatch
Upon my knee , what doth your speech import I understand a fury in your words , But not the words .
Why , what art thou
No Why When he that is my husband now Came to me , as I followed Henry’s corse , When scarce the blood was well washed from his hands Which issued from my other angel husband And that dear saint which then I weeping followed O , when , I say , I looked on Richard’s face , This was my wish be thou , quoth I , accursed For making me , so young , so old a widow And , when thou wedd’st , let sorrow haunt thy bed And be thy wife , if any be so mad , More miserable by the life of thee Than thou hast made me by my dear lord’s death . Lo , ere I can repeat this curse again , Within so small a time my woman’s heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words And proved the subject of mine own soul’s curse , Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest , For never yet one hour in his bed Did I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep , But with his timorous dreams was still awaked . Besides , he hates me for my father Warwick , And will , no doubt , shortly be rid of me .
Poor heart , adieu . I pity thy complaining .
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours .
Farewell , thou woeful welcomer of glory .
Adieu , poor soul that tak’st thy leave of it .
And must we be divided must we part
Ay , hand from hand , my love , and heart from heart .
Banish us both and send the king with me .
That were some love but little policy .
Then whither he goes , thither let me go .
So two , together weeping , make one woe . Weep thou for me in France , I for thee here Better far off than near , be ne’er the near . Go , count thy way with sighs I mine with groans .
So longest way shall have the longest moans .
Twice for one step I’ll groan , the way being short , And piece the way out with a heavy heart . Come , come , in wooing sorrow let’s be brief , Since , wedding it , there is such length in grief One kiss shall stop our mouths , and dumbly part Thus give I mine , and thus take I thy heart .
Give me mine own again ’twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart . So , now I have mine own again , be gone , That I might strive to kill it with a groan .
We make woe wanton with this fond delay Once more , adieu the rest let sorrow say .
I am no fee’d post , lady . Keep your purse . My master , not myself , lacks recompense . Love make his heart of flint that you shall love , And let your fervor , like my master’s , be Placed in contempt . Farewell , fair cruelty .
What is your parentage Above my fortunes , yet my state is well . I am a gentleman . I’ll be sworn thou art Thy tongue , thy face , thy limbs , actions , and spirit , Do give thee fivefold blazon . Not too fast Soft , soft Unless the master were the man . How now Even so quickly may one catch the plague Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes . Well , let it be . What ho , Malvolio
Here , madam , at your service .
Run after that same peevish messenger , The county’s man . He left this ring behind him , Would I or not . Tell him I’ll none of it . OLIVIA hands him a ring Desire him not to flatter with his lord , Nor hold him up with hopes . I am not for him . If that the youth will come this way tomorrow , I’ll give him reasons for ’t . Hie thee , Malvolio .
I am aweary . Give me leave awhile . Fie , how my bones ache What a jaunt have I
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news . Nay , come , I pray thee , speak . Good , good Nurse , speak .
Jesu , what haste Can you not stay awhile Do you not see that I am out of breath
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse . Is thy news good , or bad Answer to that . Say either , and I’ll stay the circumstance . Let me be satisfied . Is ’t good or bad
Well , you have made a simple choice . You know not how to choose a man . Romeo No , not he , though his face be better than any man’s , yet his leg excels all men’s , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare . He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I’ll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb . Go thy ways , wench . Serve God . What , have you dined at home
No , no . But all this did I know before . What says he of our marriage What of that
Lord , how my head aches What a head have I It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces . My back a t other side . Ah , my back , my back Beshrew your heart for sending me about , To catch my death with jaunting up and down
Would cry to a sailor , Go hang She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch , Yet a tailor might scratch her where er she did itch . Then to sea , boys , and let her go hang This is a scurvy tune too . But here’s my comfort .
Do not torment me . Oh
What’s the matter Have we devils here Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind , ha I have not ’scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs . Or it hath been said , As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground , and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at nostrils .
The spirit torments me . Oh
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got , as I take it , an ague . Where the devil should he learn our language I will give him some relief if it be but for that . If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him , he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather .
Do not torment me , prithee . I’ll bring my wood home faster .
He’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest . He shall taste of my bottle . If he have never drunk wine afore , it will go near to remove his fit . If I can recover him and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him . He shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .
Why , Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin , a pair of old breeches thrice turned , a pair of boots that have been candle cases , one buckled , another laced an old rusty sword ta en out of the town armory , with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped , with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred , besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine , troubled with the lampass , infected with the fashions , full of wingdalls , sped with spavins , rayed with yellows , past cure of the fives , stark spoiled with the staggers , begnawn with the bots , swayed in the back and shoulder shotten , near legged before and with a half checked bit and a headstall of sheeps leather , which , being restrained to keep him from stumbling , hath been often burst , and now repaired with knots , one girth six times pieced , and a woman’s crupper of velour , which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs , and here and there pieced with packthread .
To bind me or undo me , one of them . Signior Leonato , truth it is , good Signior , Your niece regards me with an eye of favor .
That eye my daughter lent her ’tis most true .
And I do with an eye of love requite her .
The sight whereof I think you had from me , From Claudio and the Prince . But what’s your will
Your answer , sir , is enigmatical . But for my will , my will is your goodwill May stand with ours , this day to be conjoined In the state of honorable marriage In which , good Friar , I shall desire your help .
My heart is with your liking .
And my help . Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
Who comes with him
O , sir , his lackey , for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose on the other , gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humor of forty fancies pricked in ’t for a feather . A monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey .
Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion , Yet oftentimes he goes but mean appareled .
I am glad he’s come , howsoe er he comes .
Good morrow to this fair assembly .
Good morrow , Prince good morrow , Claudio . We here attend you . Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother’s daughter
I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope .
Thou dost me yet but little hurt . Thou wilt anon , I know it by thy trembling . Now Prosper works upon thee .
Come on your ways . Open your mouth . Here is that which will give language to you , cat . Open your mouth . This will shake your shaking , I can tell you , and that soundly . You cannot tell who’s your friend . Open your chaps again .
I should know that voice . It should be But he is drowned , and these are devils . Oh , defend me
Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster . His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend . His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract . If all the wine in my bottle will recover him , I will help his ague . Come . CALIBAN drinks Amen I will pour some in thy other mouth .
Stephano
Doth thy other mouth call me Mercy , mercy This is a devil , and no monster . I will leave him . I have no long spoon .
Stephano If thou beest Stephano , touch me and speak to me . For I am Trinculo be not afeard thy good friend Trinculo .
My lord , you told me you would tell the rest , When weeping made you break the story off , of our two cousins coming into London .
Where did I leave
At that sad stop , my lord , Where rude misgovern’d hands from windows’ tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head .
Then , as I said , the duke , great Bolingbroke , Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed Which his aspiring rider seem’d to know , With slow but stately pace kept on his course , Whilst all tongues cried ‘God save thee , Bolingbroke ’ You would have thought the very windows spake , So many greedy looks of young and old Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage , and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once ‘Jesu preserve thee welcome , Bolingbroke ’ Whilst he , from the one side to the other turning , Bareheaded , lower than his proud steed’s neck , Bespake them thus ‘I thank you , countrymen ’ And thus still doing , thus he pass’d along .
If thou beest Trinculo , come forth . I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs . If any be Trinculo’s legs , these are they .
I faith , I am sorry that thou art not well . Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous Where is your mother
Where is my mother Why , she is within . Where should she be How oddly thou repliest Your love says , like an honest gentleman , Where is your mother
O God’s lady dear , Are you so hot Marry , come up , I trow . Is this the poultice for my aching bones Henceforward do your messages yourself .
Here’s such a coil . Come , what says Romeo
Have you got leave to go to shrift today
I have .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell . There stays a husband to make you a wife . Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks . They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news . Hie you to church . I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark . I am the drudge and toil in your delight , But you shall bear the burden soon at night . Go . I’ll to dinner . Hie you to the cell .
Your wife , my lord . Your true and loyal wife .
Come , swear it , damn thyself . Lest , being like one of heaven , the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee . Therefore be double damned , Swear thou art honest
Heaven doth truly know it .
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
To whom , my lord With whom How am I false
Ah , Desdemona , away , away , away
Alas the heavy day , why do you weep Am I the motive of these tears , my lord If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back , Lay not your blame on me . If you have lost him , Why , I have lost him too .
Had it pleased heaven To try me with affliction , had they rained All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head , Steeped me in poverty to the very lips , Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes , I should have found in some place of my soul A drop of patience . But , alas , to make me
Why , sir , he comes not .
Didst thou not say he comes
Who That Petruchio came
Ay , that Petruchio came .
No , sir , I say his horse comes , with him on his back .
Why , that’s all one .
Nay , by Saint Jamy , I hold you a penny , A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many .
Come , where be these gallants Who’s at home
You are welcome , sir .
And yet I come not well .
And yet you halt not .
Not so well appareled as I wish you were .
Go thou to sanctuary , and good thoughts possess thee . I to my grave , where peace and rest lie with me . Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen , And each hour’s joy wracked with a week of teen .
Stay , yet look back with me unto the Tower . Pity , you ancient stones , those tender babes Whom envy hath immured within your walls Rough cradle for such little pretty ones . Rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow For tender princes , use my babies well . So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell .
Call her forth , brother . Here’s the friar ready .
Good morrow , Benedick . Why , what’s the matter That you have such a February face , So full of frost , of storm and cloudiness
I think he thinks upon the savage bull . Tush , fear not , man . We’ll tip thy horns with gold , And all Europa shall rejoice at thee As once Europa did at lusty Jove When he would play the noble beast in love .
Bull Jove , sir , had an amiable low , And some such strange bull leapt your father’s cow And got a calf in that same noble feat Much like to you , for you have just his bleat .
For this I owe you . Here comes other reck nings .
Which is the lady I must seize upon
This same is she , and I do give you her .
Why , then she’s mine . Sweet , let me see your face .
No , that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her .
Madam , I will .
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind . Fate , show thy force . Ourselves we do not owe . What is decreed must be , and be this so .
Hie to high fortune Honest Nurse , farewell .
Were it better I should rush in thus But where is Kate Where is my love How does my father Gentles , methinks you frown . And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument , Some comet or unusual prodigy
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day . First were we sad , fearing you would not come , Now sadder that you come so unprovided . Fie , doff this habit , shame to your estate , An eyesore to our solemn festival .
And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detained you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourself .
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear . Sufficeth I am come to keep my word , Though in some part enforcèd to digress , Which , at more leisure , I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal . But where is Kate I stay too long from her . The morning wears . Tis time we were at church .
See not your bride in these unreverent robes . Go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
Not I , believe me . Thus I’ll visit her .
But thus , I trust , you will not marry her .
Give me your hand before this holy friar . I am your husband , if you like of me .
And when I lived , I was your other wife , And when you loved , you were my other husband .
Another Hero
Nothing certainer . One Hero died defiled , but I do live , And surely as I live , I am a maid .
The former Hero Hero that is dead
She died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death . Meantime let wonder seem familiar , And to the chapel let us presently .
Soft and fair , Friar . Which is Beatrice
I answer to that name . What is your will
Do not you love me
Why no , no more than reason .
Why then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived . They swore you did .
Do not you love me
Alack , poor Richard where rode he the whilst
As in a theatre , the eyes of men , After a well graced actor leaves the stage , Are idly bent on him that enters next , Thinking his prattle to be tedious Even so , or with much more contempt , men’s eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard no man cried ‘God save him ’ No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home But dust was thrown upon his sacred head Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off , His face still combating with tears and smiles , The badges of his grief and patience , That had not God , for some strong purpose , steel’d The hearts of men , they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him . But heaven hath a hand in these events , To whose high will we bound our calm contents . To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now , Whose state and honour I for aye allow .
Here comes my son Aumerle .
Aumerle that was But that is lost for being Richard’s friend , And , madam , you must call him Rutland now I am in parliament pledge for his truth And lasting fealty to the new made king .
Good sooth , even thus . Therefore , ha done with words To me she’s married , not unto my clothes . Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements , Twere well for Kate and better for myself . But what a fool am I to chat with you , When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss
He hath some meaning in his mad attire . We will persuade him , be it possible , To put on better ere he go to church .
I’ll after him , and see the event of this .
But sir , to love concerneth us to add Her father’s liking , which to bring to pass , As I before unparted to your worship , I am to get a man whate er he be It skills not much , we’ll fit him to our turn And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa And make assurance here in Padua Of greater sums than I have promisèd . So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent .
Will you stay no longer , nor will you not that I go with you
By your patience , no . My stars shine darkly over me . The malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours . Therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone . It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you .
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
No , sooth , sir . My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy . But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in . Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself . You must know of me then , Antonio , my name is Sebastian , which I called Roderigo . My father was that Sebastian of Messaline , whom I know you have heard of . He left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour . If the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended But you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
Alas the day
Thou art very Trinculo indeed How camest thou to be the siege of this mooncalf Can he vent Trinculos
I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke . But art thou not drowned , Stephano I hope now thou art not drowned . Is the storm overblown I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm . And art thou living , Stephano O Stephano , two Neapolitans ’scaped
Prithee , do not turn me about . My stomach is not constant .
These be fine things , an if they be not sprites . That’s a brave god and bears celestial liquor . I will kneel to him .
How didst thou ’scape How camest thou hither Swear by this bottle how thou camest hither . I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o erboard , by this bottle , which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore .
I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject , for the liquor is not earthly .
Here . Swear then how thou escapedst .
Swum ashore , man , like a duck . I can swim like a duck , I’ll be sworn .
Here , kiss the book . Though thou canst swim like a duck , thou art made like a goose .
Troth , no , no more than reason .
Why then , my cousin , Margaret , and Ursula Are much deceived , for they did swear you did .
They swore that you were almost sick for me .
They swore that you were well nigh dead for me .
So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after hours with sorrow chide us not .
Tis no such matter . Then you do not love me
No , truly , but in friendly recompense .
Amen , amen . But come what sorrow can , It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight . Do thou but close our hands with holy words , Then love devouring death do what he dare It is enough I may but call her mine .
Come , cousin , I am sure you love the gentleman .
These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die , like fire and powder , Which , as they kiss , consume . The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite . Therefore love moderately . Long love doth so . Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her , For here’s a paper written in his hand , A halting sonnet of his own pure brain , Fashioned to Beatrice .
Here comes the lady . Oh , so light a foot Will ne er wear out the everlasting flint . A lover may bestride the gossamers That idles in the wanton summer air , And yet not fall . So light is vanity .
And here’s another , Writ in my cousin’s hand , stol n from her pocket , Containing her affection unto Benedick .
A miracle Here’s our own hands against our hearts . Come , I will have thee , but , by this light , I take thee for pity .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
I would not deny you , but , by this good day , I yield upon great persuasion , and partly to save your life , for I was told you were in a consumption .
Peace I will stop your mouth .
The fixèd figure for the time of scorn To point his slow and moving finger at Yet could I bear that too , well , very well . But there where I have garnered up my heart , Where either I must live or bear no life , The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up to be discarded thence Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there , Patience , thou young and rose lipped cherubin , Ay , there , look grim as hell
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
Oh , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , That quicken even with blowing . O thou weed , Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne er been born
Alas , what ignorant sin have I committed
Was this fair paper , this most goodly book , Made to write whore upon What committed Committed O thou public commoner I should make very forges of my cheeks That would to cinders burn up modesty Did I but speak thy deeds . What committed Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks , The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth And will not hear ’t . What committed Impudent strumpet
By heaven , you do me wrong
Stand all apart . Cousin of Buckingham .
My gracious sovereign .
O Stephano , hast any more of this
Give me thy hand .
The whole butt , man . My cellar is in a rock by th seaside where my wine is hid . How now , mooncalf How does thine ague
Hast thou not dropped from heaven
Thus high , by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated . But shall we wear these glories for a day , Or shall they last and we rejoice in them
Out o th moon , I do assure thee . I was the man i the moon when time was .
Still live they , and forever let them last .
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee . My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
Ah , Buckingham , now do I play the touch , To try if thou be current gold indeed . Young Edward lives think now what I would speak .
Come , swear to that , kiss the book . I will furnish it anon with new contents , swear .
Say on , my loving lord .
Why , Buckingham , I say I would be king ,
By this good light , this is a very shallow monster . I afeard of him A very weak monster . The man i th moon A most poor credulous monster . Well drawn , monster , in good sooth
Why so you are , my thrice renownèd lord .
I’ll show thee every fertile inch o th island . And I will kiss thy foot . I prithee , be my god .
Ha Am I king Tis so but Edward lives .
True , noble prince .
By this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster . When ’s god’s asleep , he’ll rob his bottle .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music’s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament . They are but beggars that can count their worth . But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work . For , by your leaves , you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one .
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly , Twere good , methinks , to steal our marriage , Which , once performed , let all the world say no , I’ll keep mine own despite of all the world .
That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business . We’ll overreach the graybeard , Gremio , The narrow prying father , Minola , The quaint musician , amorous Litio , All for my master’s sake , Lucentio .
Signior Gremio , came you from the church
As willingly as e er I came from school .
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home
A bridegroom , say you Tis a groom indeed , A grumbling groom , and that the girl shall find .
Curster than she Why , ’tis impossible .
Why , he’s a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
Why , she’s a devil , a devil , the devil’s dam .
A lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful . But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that , yet thus far I will boldly publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair . She is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
Pardon me , sir , your bad entertainment .
O good Antonio , forgive me your trouble .
If you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
If you will not undo what you have done that is , kill him whom you have recovered desire it not . Fare you well at once . My bosom is full of kindness , and I am yet so near the manners of my mother , that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me . I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court . Farewell .
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee I have many enemies in Orsino’s court , Else would I very shortly see thee there . But , come what may , I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport , and I will go .
How dost thou , Benedick , the married man
I’ll tell thee what , Prince a college of wit crackers cannot flout me out of my humor . Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram No . If a man will be beaten with brains , he shall wear nothing handsome about him . In brief , since I do purpose to marry , I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it , and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it . For man is a giddy thing , and this is my conclusion . For thy part , Claudio , I did think to have beaten thee , but in that thou art like to be my kinsman , live unbruised , and love my cousin .
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice , that I might have cudgeled thee out of thy single life , to make thee a double dealer , which out of question , thou wilt be , if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee .
Come , come , we are friends . Let’s have a dance ere we are married , that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives heels .
We’ll have dancing afterward .
First , of my word Therefore play , music . Prince , thou art sad . Get thee a wife , get thee a wife . There is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn .
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live true noble prince Cousin , thou wast not wont to be so dull . Shall I be plain I wish the bastards dead , And I would have it suddenly performed . What sayest thou now Speak suddenly . Be brief .
Your Grace may do your pleasure .
Tut , tut , thou art all ice thy kindness freezes . Say , have I thy consent that they shall die
Give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , Before I positively speak in this . I will resolve you herein presently .
The king is angry . See , he gnaws his lip .
I will converse with iron witted fools And unrespective boys . None are for me That look into me with considerate eyes . High reaching Buckingham grows circumspect . Boy
My lord
Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death
Are you not a strumpet
No , as I am a Christian . If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet , I am none .
What , not a whore
No , as I shall be saved .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let’s retire . The day is hot the Capulets , abroad And if we meet we shall not ’scape a brawl , For now , these hot days , is the mad blood stirring .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says God send me no need of thee and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
Am I like such a fellow
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
And what to
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other . Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast . Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes . What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling . Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun . Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling
Tut , she’s a lamb , a dove , a fool to him I’ll tell you , Sir Lucentio when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife , Ay , by gogs wouns quoth he , and swore so loud That , all amazed , the priest let fall the book , And as he stooped again to take it up , The mad brained bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book , and book and priest . Now take them up , quoth he , if any list .
What said the wench when he rose again
Trembled and shook , for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him . But after many ceremonies done , He calls for wine . A health quoth he , as if He had been aboard , carousing to his mates After a storm quaffed off the muscatel And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face , Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking . This done , he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo . And I , seeing this , came thence for very shame , And after me , I know , the rout is coming . Such a mad marriage never was before .
Is ’t possible
Oh , heaven forgive us
Hark , hark I hear the minstrels play .
I cry you mercy , then , I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello . You , mistress , That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell
You , you , ay , you We have done our course . There’s money for your pains . I pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .
Alas , what does this gentleman conceive How do you , madam How do you , my good lady
Faith , half asleep .
Good madam , what’s the matter with my lord
I’ll kiss thy foot . I’ll swear myself thy subject .
Come on then . Down , and swear .
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy headed monster . A most scurvy monster . I could find in my heart to beat him
Come , kiss .
But that the poor monster’s in drink . An abominable monster
I’ll show thee the best springs . I’ll pluck thee berries . I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough . A plague upon the tyrant that I serve I’ll bear him no more sticks , but follow thee , Thou wondrous man .
A most ridiculous monster , to make a wonder of a poor drunkard .
I prithee , let me bring thee where crabs grow . And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts , Show thee a jay’s nest , and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset . I’ll bring thee To clustering filberts , and sometimes I’ll get thee Young scamels from the rock . Wilt thou go with me
I prithee now , lead the way without any more talking . Trinculo , the king and all our company else being drowned , we will inherit here . Here , bear my bottle . Fellow Trinculo , we’ll fill him by and by again .
Welcome , my son who are the violets now That strew the green lap of the new come spring
Madam , I know not , nor I greatly care not God knows I had as lief be none as one .
Well , bear you well in this new spring of time , Lest you be cropp’d before you come to prime . What news from Oxford hold those jousts and triumphs
For aught I know , my lord , they do .
You will be there , I know .
If God prevent not , I purpose so .
What seal is that , that hangs without thy bosom Yea , look’st thou pale let me see the writing .
My lord , ’tis nothing .
No matter , then , who see it I will be satisfied let me see the writing .
I do beseech your grace to pardon me It is a matter of small consequence , Which for some reasons I would not have seen .
Which for some reasons , sir , I mean to see . I fear , I fear ,
What should you fear ’Tis nothing but some bond , that he is enter’d into For gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day .
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia
The fee simple O simple
Even now , sir . On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither .
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
She returns this ring to you , sir . You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself . She adds , moreover , that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him . And one thing more , that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs , unless it be to report your lord’s taking of this . Receive it so .
By my heel , I care not .
She took the ring of me . I’ll none of it .
Follow me close , for I will speak to them . Gentlemen , good e en . A word with one of you .
Come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is it should be so returned . If it be worth stooping for , there it lies in your eye . If not , be it his that finds it .
And but one word with one of us Couple it with something . Make it a word and a blow .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
I left no ring with her . What means this lady Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her She made good view of me , indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , For she did speak in starts distractedly . She loves me , sure The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger .
Could you not take some occasion without giving
Mercutio , thou consort’st with Romeo .
I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit . Gold were as good as twenty orators , And will , no doubt , tempt him to anything .
With who
Why , with my lord , madam .
Who is thy lord
He that is yours , sweet lady .
What is his name
His name , my lord , is Tyrrel .
I partly know the man . Go , call him hither , boy
I have none . Do not talk to me , Emilia . I cannot weep , nor answers have I none , But what should go by water . Prithee , tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets . Remember , And call thy husband hither .
Here’s a change indeed
The deep revolving witty Buckingham No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me , untired , And stops he now for breath Well , be it so .
How now , Lord Stanley , what’s the news
Tis meet I should be used so , very meet . How have I been behaved that he might stick The small’st opinion on my least misuse
Know , my long lord , The marquess Dorset , as I hear , is fled To Richmond , in the parts where he abides .
What is your pleasure , madam How is ’t with you
I cannot tell . Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks . He might have chid me so , for , in good faith , I am a child to chiding .
Come hither , Catesby . Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick . I will take order for her keeping close . Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , Whom I will marry straight to Clarence daughter . The boy is foolish , and I fear not him . Look how thou dream’st I say again , give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die . About it , for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me .
What is the matter , lady
Gentlemen and friends , I thank you for you I know you think to dine with me today And have prepared great store of wedding cheer , But so it is , my haste doth call me hence , And therefore here I mean to take my leave .
Is ’t possible you will away tonight
I must away today , before night come . Make it no wonder . If you knew my business , You would entreat me rather go than stay . And , honest company , I thank you all , That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient , sweet and virtuous wife . Dine with my father , drink a health to me , For I must hence , and farewell to you all .
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner .
It may not be .
Let me entreat you .
It cannot be .
Farewell , master Farewell , farewell .
Let me entreat you .
A howling monster , a drunken monster .
No more dams I’ll make for fish , Nor fetch in firing At requiring , Nor scrape trencher , nor wash dish . Ban , Ban , Ca caliban Has a new master . Get a new man . Freedom , high day , high day , freedom , freedom , high day , freedom
I am content .
O brave monster Lead the way .
Are you content to stay
My lord , your brother John is ta en in flight And brought with armed men back to Messina .
Think not on him till tomorrow . I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him . Strike up , pipers .
Consort What , dost thou make us minstrels An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords . Here’s my fiddlestick . Here’s that shall make you dance . Zounds , consort
We talk here in the public haunt of men . Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart . Here all eyes gaze on us .
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze . I will not budge for no man’s pleasure , I .
Well , peace be with you , sir . Here comes my man .
But I’ll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery . Marry , go before to field , he’ll be your follower . Your worship in that sense may call him man .
Romeo , the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this thou art a villain .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting . Villain am I none . Therefore , farewell . I see thou know’st me not .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me . Therefore turn and draw .
Bound to himself what doth he with a bond That he is bound to Wife , thou art a fool . Boy , let me see the writing .
I do beseech you , pardon me I may not show it .
I will be satisfied let me see it , I say .
Treason foul treason Villain traitor slave
What is the matter , my lord
Ho who is within there
Saddle my horse . God for his mercy , what treachery is here
Why , what is it , my lord
Give me my boots , I say saddle my horse . Now , by mine honour , by my life , by my troth , I will appeach the villain .
What is the matter
Peace , foolish woman .
I will not peace . What is the matter , Aumerle .
Good mother , be content it is no more Than my poor life must answer .
Thy life answer
Bring me my boots I will unto the king .
None of my lord’s ring Why , he sent her none . I am the man . If it be so , as ’tis , Poor lady , she were better love a dream . Disguise , I see thou art a wickedness , Wherein the pregnant enemy does much . How easy is it for the proper false In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms Alas , our frailty is the cause , not we , For such as we are made of , such we be . How will this fadge My master loves her dearly , And I , poor monster , fond as much on him , And she , mistaken , seems to dote on me . What will become of this As I am man , My state is desperate for my master’s love . As I am woman , now , alas the day , What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe O time , thou must untangle this , not I . It is too hard a knot for me to untie
Strike him , Aumerle . Poor boy , thou art amazed . Hence , villain never more come in my sight .
Give me my boots , I say .
Why , York , what wilt thou do Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own Have we more sons or are we like to have Is not my teeming date drunk up with time And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age , And rob me of a happy mother’s name Is he not like thee is he not thine own
Thou fond mad woman , Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament , And interchangeably set down their hands , To kill the king at Oxford .
He shall be none We’ll keep him here then what is that to him
Away , fond woman were he twenty times my son , I would appeach him .
Hadst thou groan’d for him As I have done , thou wouldst be more pitiful . But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect That I have been disloyal to thy bed , And that he is a bastard , not thy son Sweet York , sweet husband , be not of that mind He is as like thee as a man may be , Not like to me , or any of my kin , And yet I love him .
Alas , Iago , my lord hath so bewhored her , Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her , That true hearts cannot bear it .
Am I that name , Iago
What name , fair lady
Such as she says my lord did say I was .
He called her whore . A beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callet .
Why did he so
I do not know . I am sure I am none such .
Do not weep , do not weep . Alas the day
Hath she forsook so many noble matches , Her father and her country , and her friends , To be called whore Would it not make one weep
It is my wretched fortune .
Beshrew him for ’t How comes this trick upon him
Nay , heaven doth know .
I will be hanged , if some eternal villain , Some busy and insinuating rogue , Some cogging , cozening slave , to get some office , Have not devised this slander . I will be hanged else
I must be married to my brother’s daughter , Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass . Murder her brothers , and then marry her Uncertain way of gain . But I am in So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin . Tear falling pity dwells not in this eye .
Is thy name Tyrrel
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
Art thou indeed
Prove me , my gracious sovereign .
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine
Please you . But I had rather kill two enemies .
Why then , thou hast it . Two deep enemies , Foes to my rest , and my sweet sleep’s disturbers , Are they that I would have thee deal upon . Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
Let me have open means to come to them , And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them .
Thou sing’st sweet music . Hark , come hither , Tyrrel .
Go , by this token . Rise , and lend thine ear .
I am content you shall entreat me stay , But yet not stay , entreat me how you can .
Now , if you love me , stay .
Grumio , my horse .
Ay , sir , they be ready . The oats have eaten the horses .
Nay , then , Do what thou canst , I will not go today , No , nor tomorrow , not till I please myself . The door is open , sir . There lies your way . You may be jogging whiles your boots are green . For me , I’ll not be gone till I please myself . Tis like you’ll prove a jolly surly groom , That take it on you at the first so roundly .
O Kate , content thee . Prithee , be not angry .
I will be angry . What hast thou to do Father , be quiet . He shall stay my leisure .
Ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work .
Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner . I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist .
They shall go forward , Kate , at thy command . Obey the bride , you that attend on her . Go to the feast , revel and domineer , Carouse full measure to her maidenhead , Be mad and merry , or go hang yourselves . But for my bonny Kate , she must with me . Nay , look not big , nor stamp , nor stare , nor fret I will be master of what is mine own . She is my goods , my chattels she is my house , My household stuff , my field , my barn , My horse , my ox , my ass , my anything . And here she stands , touch her whoever dare . I’ll bring mine action on the proudest he That stops my way in Padua . Grumio , Draw forth thy weapon , we are beset with thieves . Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man . Fear not , sweet wench , they shall not touch thee , Kate . I’ll buckler thee against a million .
Make way , unruly woman
I do protest I never injured thee , But love thee better than thou canst devise , Till thou shalt know the reason of my love . And so , good Capulet which name I tender As dearly as my own be satisfied .
After , Aumerle mount thee upon his horse Spur post , and get before him to the king , And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee . I’ll not be long behind though I be old , I doubt not but to ride as fast as York And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardon’d thee . Away , be gone
O calm dishonourable , vile submission Alla stoccata carries it away . Tybalt , you ratcatcher , will you walk
What wouldst thou have with me
Good King of Cats , nothing but one of your nine lives , that I mean to make bold withal , and , as you shall use me hereafter , dry beat the rest of the eight . Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
I am for you .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
Come , sir , your passado .
Draw , Benvolio . Beat down their weapons . Gentlemen , for shame Forbear this outrage . Tybalt , Mercutio The Prince expressly hath Forbidden bandying in Verona streets . Hold , Tybalt Good Mercutio
There be some sports are painful , and their labor Delight in them sets off . Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone . And most poor matters Point to rich ends . This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious , but The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead And makes my labors pleasures . Oh , she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed , And he’s composed of harshness . I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up , Upon a sore injunction . My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work , and says such baseness Had never like executor . I forget , But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors , Most busiest when I do it .
Alas now , pray you , Work not so hard . I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile Pray , set it down and rest you . When this burns , Twill weep for having wearied you . My father Is hard at study . Pray now , rest yourself . He’s safe for these three hours .
There is no more but so . Say it is done , And I will love thee and prefer thee for it .
Nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones .
I will dispatch it straight .
Went they not quickly , I should die with laughing .
Of all mad matches never was the like .
Mistress , what’s your opinion of your sister
My lord , I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in .
That , being mad herself , she’s madly mated .
Well , let that rest . Dorset is fled to Richmond .
I warrant him , Petruchio is Kated .
I hear the news , my lord .
Neighbors and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table , You know there wants no junkets at the feast .
Stanley , he is your wife’s son . Well , look unto it .
My lord , I claim the gift , my due by promise , For which your honor and your faith is pawned Th earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promisèd I shall possess .
Stanley , look to your wife . If she convey Letters to Richmond , you shall answer it .
What says your Highness to my just request
Cease to persuade , my loving Proteus Home keeping youth have ever homely wits . Were ’t not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honored love , I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad Than , living dully sluggardized at home , Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness . But since thou lov’st , love still and thrive therein , Even as I would when I to love begin .
Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine , adieu Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel . Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger , If ever danger do environ thee , Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers , For I will be thy beadsman , Valentine .
And on a love book pray for my success
Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee .
That’s on some shallow story of deep love , How young Leander crossed the Hellespont .
Approach , Sir Andrew . Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes , and diluculo surgere , thou know’st ,
Nay , my troth , I know not . But I know to be up late is to be up late .
A false conclusion . I hate it as an unfilled can . To be up after midnight and to go to bed then , is early , so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes . Does not our life consist of the four elements
Faith , so they say , but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking .
Thou rt a scholar . Let us therefore eat and drink . Marian , I say A stoup of wine
Here comes the fool , i faith .
How now , my hearts Did you never see the picture of We Three
Welcome , ass . Now let’s have a catch .
Fie , there is no such man . It is impossible .
If any such there be , heaven pardon him
A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones Why should he call her whore Who keeps her company What place What time What form What likelihood The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave , Some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow . O heavens , that such companions thou’dst unfold , And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th west
Speak within door .
Oh , fie upon them Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor .
You are a fool . Go to .
Alas Iago , What shall I do to win my lord again Good friend , go to him . For , by this light of heaven , I know not how I lost him . Here I kneel If e er my will did trespass gainst his love , Either in discourse of thought or actual deed , Or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense , Delighted them , or any other form , Or that I do not yet , and ever did ,
Away , Tybalt .
I am hurt . A plague o both your houses I am sped . Is he gone and hath nothing
What , art thou hurt
Ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch . Marry , ’tis enough . Where is my page Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
Courage , man . The hurt cannot be much .
No , ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door , but ’tis enough , ’twill serve . Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man . I am peppered , I warrant , for this world . A plague o both your houses Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic Why the devil came you between us I was hurt under your arm .
I thought all for the best .
O most dear mistress , The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do .
If you’ll sit down , I’ll bear your logs the while . Pray , give me that . I’ll carry it to the pile .
No , precious creature . I had rather crack my sinews , break my back , Than you should such dishonor undergo While I sit lazy by .
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son ’Tis full three months since I did see him last If any plague hang over us , ’tis he . I would to God , my lords , he might be found Inquire at London , ’mongst the taverns there , For there , they say , he daily doth frequent , With unrestrained loose companions , Even such , they say , as stand in narrow lanes , And beat our watch , and rob our passengers Which he , young wanton and effeminate boy , Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew .
My lord , some two days since I saw the prince , And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford .
It would become me As well as it does you , and I should do it With much more ease , for my good will is to it And yours it is against .
Poor worm , thou art infected This visitation shows it .
You look wearily .
And what said the gallant
His answer was , he would unto the stews , And from the common’st creature pluck a glove , And wear it as a favour and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger .
As dissolute as desperate yet through both I see some sparks of better hope , which elder years May happily bring forth . But who comes here
Lucentio , you shall supply the bridegroom’s place , And let Bianca take her sister’s room .
No , noble mistress . Tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night . I do beseech you Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers What is your name
Shall sweet Bianca practice how to bride it
She shall , Lucentio . Come , gentlemen , let’s go .
By my troth , the fool has an excellent breast . I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg , and so sweet a breath to sing , as the fool has . In sooth , thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus , of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus . Twas very good , i faith . I sent thee sixpence for thy leman . Hadst it
Miranda . O my father , I have broke your hest to say so
I did impeticos thy gratillity , for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock . My lady has a white hand , and the Myrmidons are no bottle ale houses .
Excellent Why , this is the best fooling when all is done . Now , a song .
Come on . There is sixpence for you . Let’s have a song .
There’s a testril of me too . If one knight give a
Would you have a love song or a song of good life
A love song , a love song .
Ay , ay . I care not for good life .
O mistress mine , where are you roaming O , stay and hear Your true love’s coming , That can sing both high and low Trip no further , pretty sweeting . Journeys end in lovers meeting , Every wise man’s son doth know .
Admired Miranda Indeed the top of admiration , worth What’s dearest to th world Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
That’s a deep story of a deeper love , For he was more than over shoes in love .
’Tis true for you are over boots in love , And yet you never swam the Hellespont .
Over the boots Nay , give me not the boots .
No , I will not , for it boots thee not .
What
To be in love , where scorn is bought with groans , Coy looks with heartsore sighs , one fading moment’s mirth With twenty watchful , weary , tedious nights . If haply won , perhaps a hapless gain If lost , why then a grievous labour won However , but a folly bought with wit , Or else a wit by folly vanquishèd .
So , by your circumstance , you call me fool .
So , by your circumstance , I fear you’ll prove .
’Tis love you cavil at . I am not Love .
Love is your master , for he masters you And he that is so yokèd by a fool Methinks , should not be chronicled for wise .
Yet writers say , as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells , so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of all .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint . A plague o both your houses They have made worms meat of me . I have it , And soundly too . Your houses
This gentleman , the Prince’s near ally , My very friend , hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf . My reputation stained With Tybalt’s slander . Tybalt , that an hour Hath been my kinsman O sweet Juliet , Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor’s steel
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds , Which too untimely here did scorn the earth .
This day’s black fate on more days doth depend . This but begins the woe others must end .
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Alive in triumph and Mercutio slain Away to heaven , respective lenity , And fire eyed fury be my conduct now . Now , Tybalt , take the villain back again That late thou gavest me , for Mercutio’s soul Is but a little way above our heads , Staying for thine to keep him company . Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
I do remember me , Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king , When Richmond was a little peevish boy . A king , perhaps
My lord
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .
How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me , I being by , that I should kill him
This shall determine that .
My lord , your promise for the earldom
Richmond When last I was at Exeter , The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont , at which name I started , Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond .
Romeo , away , be gone The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain . Stand not amazed . The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken . Hence , be gone , away
My Lord
Oh , I am fortune’s fool
Why dost thou stay
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he
There lies that Tybalt .
Up , sir , go with me . I charge thee in the Prince’s name , obey .
Ay , what’s o clock
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me .
Well , but what’s o clock
Upon the stroke of ten .
Well , let it strike .
Why let it strike
And ever will though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement love him dearly , Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much , And his unkindness may defeat my life , But never taint my love . I cannot say whore , It does abhor me now I speak the word . To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me .
I pray you , be content , ’tis but his humor . The business of the state does him offence , And he does chide with you .
If ’twere no other
Tis but so , I warrant .
Hark , how these instruments summon to supper . The messengers of Venice stays the meat . Go in , and weep not . All things shall be well .
How now , Roderigo
I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me .
What in the contrary
And writers say , as the most forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow , Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turned to folly , blasting in the bud , Losing his verdure even in the prime , And all the fair effects of future hopes . But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee That art a votary to fond desire Once more adieu My father at the road Expects my coming , there to see me shipped .
Every day thou daff’st me with some device , Iago , and rather , as it seems to me now , keep’st from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope .
And thither will I bring thee , Valentine .
Sweet Proteus , no . Now let us take our leave . To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love , and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend And I likewise will visit thee with mine .
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan
As much to you at home And so , farewell
He after honor hunts , I after love . He leaves his friends to dignify them more I leave myself , my friends , and all , for love . Thou , Julia , thou hast metamorphosed me , Made me neglect my studies , lose my time , War with good counsel , set the world at naught Made wit with musing weak , heart sick with thought .
Fie , fie on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways Was ever man so beaten Was ever man so rayed Was ever man so weary I am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them . Now , were not I a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere I should come by a fire to thaw me . But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself . For , considering the weather , a taller man than I will take cold . Holla , ho Curtis
Who is that calls so coldly
A piece of ice . If thou doubt it , thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck . A fire , good Curtis .
Is my master and his wife coming , Grumio
Oh , ay , Curtis , ay , and therefore fire , fire . Cast on no water .
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported
Excellent good , i faith .
Good , good .
What is love Tis not hereafter . Present mirth hath present laughter . What’s to come is still unsure . In delay there lies no plenty . Then come kiss me , sweet and twenty . Youth’s a stuff will not endure .
A mellifluous voice , as I am true knight .
A contagious breath .
Very sweet and contagious , i faith .
To hear by the nose , it is dulcet in contagion . But shall we make the welkin dance indeed Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver Shall we do that
An you love me , let’s do ’t . I am dog at a catch .
By r lady , sir , and some dogs will catch well .
Th harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear . For several virtues Have I liked several women . Never any With so full soul but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed And put it to the foil . But you , O you , So perfect and so peerless , are created Of every creature’s best .
Most certain . Let our catch be Thou Knave .
Hold thy peace , thou knave , knight I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave , knight .
I do not know One of my sex , no woman’s face remember Save , from my glass , mine own . Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you , good friend , And my dear father . How features are abroad I am skill less of , but , by my modesty , The jewel in my dower , I would not wish Any companion in the world but you , Nor can imagination form a shape Besides yourself to like of . But I prattle Something too wildly , and my father’s precepts I therein do forget .
I am in my condition A prince , Miranda I do think , a king I would , not so and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh fly blow my mouth . Hear my soul speak . The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service , there resides To make me slave to it , and for your sake Am I this patient log man .
Do you love me
O heaven , O earth , bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event
Where is the king
What means our cousin , that he stares and looks So wildly
God save your grace I do beseech your majesty , To have some conference with your grace alone .
Withdraw yourselves , and leave us here alone .
What is the matter with our cousin now
For ever may my knees grow to the earth , My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak .
Intended or committed was this fault If on the first , how heinous e’er it be , To win thy after love I pardon thee .
Then give me leave that I may turn the key , That no man enter till my tale be done .
Have thy desire .
My liege , beware look to thyself Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there .
Villain , I’ll make thee safe .
Stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear .
She was , good Curtis , before this frost . But thou knowest winter tames man , woman and beast , for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself , fellow Curtis .
Away , you three inch fool I am no beast .
Am I but three inches Why , thy horn is a foot , and so long am I , at the least . But wilt thou make a fire , or shall I complain on thee to our mistress , whose hand , she being now at hand , thou shalt soon feel , to thy cold comfort , for being slow in thy hot office
I prithee , good Grumio , tell me , how goes the world
A cold world , Curtis , in every office but thine , and therefore fire Do thy duty , and have thy duty , for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death .
There’s fire ready . And therefore , good Grumio , the news .
Why , Jack , boy Ho , boy and as much news as wilt thou .
Come , you are so full of cony catching
Why , therefore fire , for I have caught extreme cold . Where’s the cook Is supper ready , the house trimmed , rushes strewed , cobwebs swept , the servingmen in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding garment on Be the Jacks fair within , the Jills fair without , the carpets laid , and everything in order
If I speak true If hollowly , invert What best is boded me to mischief I Beyond all limit of what else i th world Do love , prize , honor you .
Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave . Begin , Fool . It begins Hold thy peace .
I shall never begin if I hold my peace .
Good , i faith . Come , begin .
What a caterwauling do you keep here If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors , never trust me .
My lady’s a Cataian . We are politicians , Malvolio’s a Peg a Ramsey , and There dwelt a man in Babylon , lady , lady
Beshrew me , the knight’s in admirable fooling .
Ay , he does well enough if he be disposed , and so do I too . He does it with a better grace , but I do it more natural .
O the twelfth day of December
For the love o God , peace
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of .
Fair encounter Of two most rare affections Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between em
Wherefore weep you
At mine unworthiness , that dare not offer What I desire to give , and much less take What I shall die to want . But this is trifling , And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows . Hence , bashful cunning , And prompt me , plain and holy innocence I am your wife if you will marry me . If not , I’ll die your maid . To be your fellow You may deny me , but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no .
My mistress , dearest , and I thus humble ever .
My husband , then
Ay , with a heart as willing As bondage e er of freedom . Here’s my hand .
And mine , with my heart in ’t . And now farewell Till half an hour hence .
Sir Proteus , save you Saw you my master
But now he parted hence , to embark for Milan .
Twenty to one , then , he is shipped already , And I have played the sheep in losing him .
Indeed , a sheep doth very often stray , An if the shepherd be a while away .
You conclude that my master is a shepherd , then , and I a sheep
I do .
Where are the vile beginners of this fray
Why then , my horns are his horns , whether I wake or sleep .
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl . There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
A silly answer , and fitting well a sheep .
Tybalt , my cousin O my brother’s child O Prince O cousin Husband Oh , the blood is spilled Of my dear kinsman Prince , as thou art true , For blood of ours shed blood of Montague . O cousin , cousin
This proves me still a sheep .
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray
True and thy master a shepherd .
Tybalt here slain , whom Romeo’s hand did slay . Romeo , that spoke him fair , bade him bethink How nice the quarrel was and urged withal Your high displeasure . All this uttered With gentle breath , calm look , knees humbly bowed , Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace , but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast , Who , all as hot , turns deadly point to point , And , with a martial scorn , with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends It back to Tybalt , whose dexterity , Retorts it . Romeo , he cries aloud , Hold , friends Friends , part and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And ’twixt them rushes underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .
Nay , that I can deny by a circumstance .
It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another .
The shepherd seeks the sheep , and not the sheep the shepherd but I seek my master , and my master seeks not me . Therefore I am no sheep .
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep . Thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee . Therefore thou art a sheep .
Such another proof will make me cry Baa .
But dost thou hear Gav’st thou my letter to Julia
Ay , sir . I , a lost mutton , gave your letter to her , a laced mutton , and she , a laced mutton , gave me , a lost mutton , nothing for my labor .
Here’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons .
If the ground be overcharged , you were best stick her .
Nay , in that you are astray ’twere best pound you .
I will indeed no longer endure it , nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered .
Because that , like a jack , thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation . I am not in the giving vein today .
Will you hear me , Roderigo
Why then , resolve me whether you will or no .
I have heard too much , and your words and performances are no kin together .
Thou troublest me I am not in the vein .
You charge me most unjustly .
And is it thus Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt Made I him king for this O , let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock , while my fearful head is on
With naught but truth . I have wasted myself out of my means . The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress . You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but I find none .
Well , go to . Very well .
Very well , go to I cannot go to , man , nor ’tis not very well . Nay , I think it is scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it .
Open the door , secure , foolhardy king Shall I for love speak treason to thy face Open the door , or I will break it open .
What is the matter , uncle speak Recover breath tell us how near is danger , That we may arm us to encounter it .
Peruse this writing here , and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show .
Remember , as thou read’st , thy promise pass’d I do repent me read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand .
It was , villain , ere thy hand did set it down . I tore it from the traitor’s bosom , king Fear , and not love , begets his penitence Forget to pity him , lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart .
O heinous , strong and bold conspiracy O loyal father of a treacherous son Thou sheer , immaculate and silver fountain , From when this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defiled himself Thy overflow of good converts to bad , And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing son .
Very well .
I tell you ’tis not very well . I will make myself known to Desdemona . If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation . If not , assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you .
You have said now .
Ay , and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to ’t they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain . And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly . This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
My masters , are you mad Or what are you Have you no wit , manners , nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night Do you make an alehouse of my lady’s house , that you squeak out your coziers catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice Is there no respect of place , persons , nor time in you
We did keep time , sir , in our catches . Sneck up
He is a kinsman to the Montague . Affection makes him false . He speaks not true . Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life . I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give . Romeo slew Tybalt . Romeo must not live .
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio . Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
Sir Toby , I must be round with you . My lady bade me tell you , that , though she harbors you as her kinsman , she’s nothing allied to your disorders . If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors , you are welcome to the house . If not , an it would please you to take leave of her , she is very willing to bid you farewell .
Farewell , dear heart , since I must needs be gone .
Nay , good Sir Toby .
His eyes do show his days are almost done .
Not Romeo , Prince , he was Mercutio’s friend . His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .
Nay , sir , less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter .
You mistake . I mean the pound a pinfold .
And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence . I have an interest in your hearts proceeding . My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a bleeding . But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine . I will be deaf to pleading and excuses . Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none . Let Romeo hence in haste , Else , when he’s found , that hour is his last . Bear hence this body and attend our will . Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
From a pound to a pin Fold it over and over , ’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover .
Is ’t even so
But what said she
But I will never die .
Ay .
Sir Toby , there you lie .
Nod ay why , that’s noddy .
This is much credit to you .
You mistook , sir . I say she did nod , and you ask me if she did nod , and I say , Ay .
And that set together is noddy .
Now you have taken the pains to set it together , take it for your pains .
No , no , you shall have it for bearing the letter .
Well , I perceive I must be fain to bear with you .
Why , sir , how do you bear with me
Marry , sir , the letter , very orderly , having nothing but the word noddy for my pains .
Beshrew me , but you have a quick wit .
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse .
The tyrannous and bloody act is done , The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of . Dighton and Forrest , whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery , Albeit they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , Melted with tenderness and mild compassion , Wept like two children in their deaths sad story . O thus quoth Dighton , lay those gentle babes . Thus , thus , quoth Forrest , girdling one another Within their alabaster innocent arms . Their lips were four red roses on a stalk , And in their summer beauty kissed each other . A book of prayers on their pillow lay , Which once , quoth Forrest , almost changed my mind , But O , the devil There the villain stopped When Dighton thus told on We smotherèd The most replenishèd sweet work of nature That from the prime creation e er she framed . Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse They could not speak and so I left them both To bear this tidings to the bloody king .
Come , come , open the matter in brief . What said she
Open your purse , that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered .
And here he comes . All health , my sovereign lord .
Kind Tyrrel , am I happy in thy news
Well , sir , here is for your pains . What said she
Truly , sir , I think you’ll hardly win her .
Why , couldst thou perceive so much from her
Sir , I could perceive nothing at all from her , no , not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter . And being so hard to me that brought your mind , I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind . Give her no token but stones , for she’s as hard as steel .
What said she Nothing
All ready . And therefore , I pray thee , news .
First , know my horse is tired , my master and mistress fallen out .
How
Out of their saddles into the dirt , and thereby hangs a tale .
Let’s ha ’t , good Grumio .
Lend thine ear .
Here .
There
This ’tis to feel a tale , not to hear a tale .
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale . And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list ning . Now I begin Imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress
Both of one horse
What’s that to thee
A thousand thousand
So glad of this as they I cannot be , Who are surprised withal . But my rejoicing At nothing can be more . I’ll to my book , For yet ere supper time must I perform Much business appertaining .
Gallop apace , you fiery footed steeds , Toward Phoebus lodging . Such a wagoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west And bring in cloudy night immediately . Spread thy close curtain , love performing night , That runaways eyes may wink , and Romeo Leap to these arms , untalked of and unseen . Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night . Come , civil night , Thou sober suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods . Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty . Come , night . Come , Romeo . Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back . Come , gentle night , come , loving , black browed night , Give me my Romeo . And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun . Oh , I have bought the mansion of a love , But not possessed it , and though I am sold , Not yet enjoyed . So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them .
Why , now I see there’s mettle in thee , and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before . Give me thy hand , Roderigo . Thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair .
It hath not appeared .
I grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment . But , Roderigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which I have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean purpose , courage and valor this night show it . If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .
Well , what is it Is it within reason and compass
Sir , there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place .
Is that true Why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .
Shall I bid him go
Oh , no , he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona , unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio .
What an if you do
How do you mean , removing of him
Shall I bid him go , and spare not
Why , by making him uncapable of Othello’s place knocking out his brains .
O no , no , no , no , you dare not .
Out o tune , sir . You lie . Art any more than a steward Dost thou think , because thou art virtuous , there shall be no more cakes and ale
And that you would have me to do
Yes , by Saint Anne , and ginger shall be hot i the mouth too .
So shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd And he shall spend mine honour with his shame , As thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold . Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies , Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies Thou kill’st me in his life giving him breath , The traitor lives , the true man’s put to death .
Thou rt i the right . Go , sir , rub your chain with crumbs . A stoup of wine , Maria
What ho , my liege for God’s sake , let me in .
Mistress Mary , if you prized my lady’s favor at anything more than contempt , you would not give means for this uncivil rule . She shall know of it , by this hand .
What shrill voiced suppliant makes this eager cry
A woman , and thy aunt , great king ’tis I . Speak with me , pity me , open the door . A beggar begs that never begg’d before .
Our scene is alter’d from a serious thing , And now changed to ‘The Beggar and the King . ’ My dangerous cousin , let your mother in I know she is come to pray for your foul sin .
Go shake your ears
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a hungry , to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
Do ’t , knight . I’ll write thee a challenge . Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
If thou do pardon , whosoever pray , More sins for this forgiveness prosper may . This fester’d joint cut off , the rest rest sound This let alone will all the rest confound .
O king , believe not this hard hearted man Love loving not itself none other can .
Why , a horse .
Tell thou the tale But hadst thou not crossed me , thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell , and she under her horse . Thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place , how she was bemoiled , how he left her with the horse upon her , how he beat me because her horse stumbled , how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me , how he swore , how she prayed that never prayed before , how I cried , how the horses ran away , how her bridle was burst , how I lost my crupper , with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion , and thou return unexperienced to thy grave .
By this reck ning he is more shrew than she .
Ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home . But what talk I of this Call forth Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest . Let their heads be slickly combed , their blue coats brushed , and their garters of an indifferent knit . Let them curtsy with their left legs , and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse tail till they kiss their hands . Are they all ready
They are .
Call them forth .
Do you hear , ho you must meet my master to countenance my mistress .
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness , be happy then , For it is done .
But did’st thou see them dead
I did , my lord .
And buried , gentle Tyrrel
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them , But where , to say the truth , I do not know .
Come to me , Tyrrel , soon at after supper , When thou shalt tell the process of their death . Meantime , but think how I may do thee good , And be inheritor of thy desire . Farewell till then .
I humbly take my leave .
The son of Clarence have I pent up close , His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage , The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom , And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight . Now , for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth , my brother’s daughter , And by that knot looks proudly on the crown , To her go I , a jolly thriving wooer .
Sweet Sir Toby , be patient for tonight . Since the youth of the count’s was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet . For Monsieur Malvolio , let me alone with him . If I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation , do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed . I know I can do it .
Possess us , possess us , tell us something of him .
Marry , sir , sometimes he is a kind of puritan .
O , if I thought that , I’d beat him like a dog
What , for being a puritan Thy exquisite reason , dear knight
I have no exquisite reason for ’t , but I have reason good enough .
The devil a puritan that he is , or anything constantly , but a time pleaser an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself , so crammed , as he thinks , with excellencies , that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him . And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
What wilt thou do
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love , wherein by the color of his beard , the shape of his leg , the manner of his gait , the expressure of his eye , forehead , and complexion , he shall find himself most feelingly personated .
Why , she hath a face of her own .
Who knows not that
Thou , it seems , that calls for company to countenance her .
I call them forth to credit her .
Why , she comes to borrow nothing of them .
Welcome home , Grumio .
How now , Grumio
What , Grumio
Fellow Grumio
How now , old lad
Welcome , you How now , you What , you Fellow , you And thus much for greeting . Now , my spruce companions , is all ready , and all things neat
All things is ready . How near is our master
E en at hand , alighted by this . And therefore be not Cock’s passion , silence I hear my master .
Oh , here comes my Nurse , And she brings news , and every tongue that speaks But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence . Now , Nurse , what news What hast thou there The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch
Ay , ay , the cords .
Tell not me . When the butt is out , we will drink water . Not a drop before . Therefore bear up and board em . Servant monster , drink to me .
Ay me , what news Why dost thou wring thy hands
Servant monster The folly of this island . They say there’s but five upon this isle . We are three of them . If th other two be brained like us , the state totters .
Drink , servant monster , when I bid thee . Thy eyes are almost set in thy head .
Ah , welladay He’s dead , he’s dead , he’s dead We are undone , lady , we are undone Alack the day He’s gone , he’s killed , he’s dead
Where should they be set else He were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
Can heaven be so envious
My man monster hath drowned his tongue in sack . For my part , the sea cannot drown me . I swam , ere I could recover the shore , five and thirty leagues off and on . By this light , thou shalt be my lieutenant , monster , or my standard .
Romeo can , Though heaven cannot . O Romeo , Romeo Who ever would have thought it Romeo
Your lieutenant , if you list . He’s no standard .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus This torture should be roared in dismal hell . Hath Romeo slain himself Say thou but ay , And that bare vowel I shall poison more Than the death darting eye of cockatrice . I am not I if there be such an I , Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer ay . If he be slain , say ay , or if not , no . Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
We’ll not run , Monsieur Monster .
I saw the wound , I saw it with mine eyes God save the mark here on his manly breast . A piteous corse , a bloody piteous corse . Pale , pale as ashes , all bedaubed in blood , All in gore blood . I swoonèd at the sight .
Nor go neither . But you’ll lie like dogs , and yet say nothing neither .
Ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right . He sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will I go to him . He knows not yet of his honorable fortune . If you will watch his going thence you may take him at your pleasure . I will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us . Come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me . I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him . It is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste . About it
I will hear further reason for this .
And you shall be satisfied .
No , not so much as Take this for thy pains . To testify your bounty , I thank you , you have testerned me in requital whereof , henceforth carry your letters yourself . And so , sir , I’ll commend you to my master .
Go , go , begone , to save your ship from wreck , Which cannot perish having thee aboard , Being destined to a drier death on shore .
I must go send some better messenger . I fear my Julia would not deign my lines , Receiving them from such a worthless post .
I can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
Excellent I smell a device .
I have ’t in my nose too .
He shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she’s in love with him .
My purpose is , indeed , a horse of that color .
And your horse now would make him an ass .
Ass , I doubt not .
Oh , ’twill be admirable
Sport royal , I warrant you . I know my physic will work with him . I will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter . Observe his construction of it . For this night , to bed , and dream on the event . Farewell .
Good night , Penthesilea .
Before me , she’s a good wench .
She’s a beagle , true bred , and one that adores me . What o that
I was adored once too .
My lord
Good or bad news , that thou com’st in so bluntly
Bad news , my lord . Morton is fled to Richmond , And Buckingham , backed with the hardy Welshmen , Is in the field , and still his power increaseth .
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash levied strength . Come , I have learned that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay Delay leads impotent and snail paced beggary Then fiery expedition be my wing , Jove’s Mercury , and herald for a king . Go , muster men . My counsel is my shield . We must be brief when traitors brave the field .
Thou frantic woman , what dost thou make here Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
Sweet York , be patient . Hear me , gentle liege .
Rise up , good aunt .
Not yet , I thee beseech For ever will I walk upon my knees , And never see day that the happy sees , Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy , By pardoning Rutland , my transgressing boy .
Unto my mother’s prayers I bend my knee .
Against them both my true joints bended be . Ill mayst thou thrive , if thou grant any grace
Pleads he in earnest look upon his face His eyes do drop no tears , his prayers are in jest His words come from his mouth , ours from our breast He prays but faintly and would be denied We pray with heart and soul and all beside His weary joints would gladly rise , I know Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow His prayers are full of false hypocrisy Ours of true zeal and deep integrity . Our prayers do out pray his then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have .
Let’s to bed , knight . Thou hadst need send for more money .
If I cannot recover your niece , I am a foul way out .
Send for money , knight . If thou hast her not i the end , call me Cut .
If I do not , never trust me , take it how you will .
Come , come , I’ll go burn some sack . Tis too late to go to bed now . Come , knight . Come , knight .
Where be these knaves What , no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse Where is Nathaniel , Gregory , Philip
Here , here , sir Here , sir
Here , sir Here , sir Here , sir Here , sir You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms What , no attendance No regard No duty Where is the foolish knave I sent before
O , break , my hear , poor bankrupt , break at once To prison , eyes , ne er look on liberty . Vile earth , to earth resign . End motion here , And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had O courteous Tybalt Honest gentleman That ever I should live to see thee dead .
What storm is this that blows so contrary Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead My dearest cousin and my dearer lord Then , dreadful trumpet , sound the general doom For who is living if those two are gone
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banishèd . Romeo that killed him he is banishèd .
O God , did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood
It did , it did . Alas the day , it did .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave Beautiful tyrant Fiend angelical Dove feathered raven , wolvish ravening lamb Despisèd substance of divinest show , Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st . A damnèd saint , an honorable villain O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound Oh , that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace
I do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
Oh , pardon me , ’twill do me good to walk .
Madam , good night . I humbly thank your ladyship .
Your honor is most welcome .
Here , sir , as foolish as I was before .
Will you walk , sir O Desdemona
You peasant swain You whoreson malt horse drudge Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee
Nathaniel’s coat , sir , was not fully made , And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i th heel . There was no link to color Peter’s hat , And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing . There were none fine but Adam , Rafe , and Gregory . The rest were ragged , old , and beggarly . Yet , as they are , here are they come to meet you .
Go , rascals , go , and fetch my supper in .
Singing Where is the life that late I led Where are those Sit down , Kate , and welcome . Soud , soud , soud , soud
My lord
Get you to bed on th instant , I will be returned Forthwith . Dismiss your attendant there , look ’t be done .
I will , my lord .
How goes it now He looks gentler than he did .
But say , Lucetta , now we are alone , Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
Ay , madam , so you stumble not unheedfully .
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me , In thy opinion which is worthiest love
Please you repeat their names , I’ll show my mind According to my shallow simple skill .
What think’st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour
As of a knight well spoken , neat , and fine But , were I you , he never should be mine .
What think’st thou of the rich Mercatio
Well of his wealth , but of himself , so so .
What think’st thou of the gentle Proteus
Lord , Lord , to see what folly reigns in us
How now What means this passion at his name
Pardon , dear madam , ’tis a passing shame That I , unworthy body as I am , Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen .
Good aunt , stand up .
Why not on Proteus , as of all the rest
So now prosperity begins to mellow And drop into the rotten mouth of death . Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies . A dire induction am I witness to , And will to France , hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter , black , and tragical . Withdraw thee , wretched Margaret . Who comes here
Then thus , of many good I think him best .
Nay , do not say , ‘stand up ’ Say , ‘pardon’ first , and afterwards ‘stand up . ’ And if I were thy nurse , thy tongue to teach , ‘Pardon’ should be the first word of thy speech . I never long’d to hear a word till now Say ‘pardon , ’ king let pity teach thee how The word is short , but not so short as sweet No word like ‘pardon’ for kings’ mouths so meet .
Your reason
Speak it in French , king say , ‘pardonne moi . ’
Ah , my poor princes Ah , my tender babes , My unblown flowers , new appearing sweets , If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual , Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother’s lamentation .
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy Ah , my sour husband , my hard hearted lord , That set’st the word itself against the word Speak ‘pardon’ as ’tis current in our land The chopping French we do not understand . Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce , Pity may move thee ‘pardon’ to rehearse .
Hover about her say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night .
Good aunt , stand up .
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe wearied tongue is still and mute . Edward Plantagenet , why art thou dead
I do not sue to stand Pardon is all the suit I have in hand .
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet Edward for Edward pays a dying debt .
I pardon him , as God shall pardon me .
He says he will return incontinent , And hath commanded me to go to bed And bid me to dismiss you .
Dismiss me
It was his bidding . Therefore , good Emilia , Give me my nightly wearing , and adieu . We must not now displease him .
Mooncalf , speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good mooncalf .
How does thy honor Let me lick thy shoe . I’ll not serve him . He’s not valiant .
Thou liest , most ignorant monster . I am in case to justle a constable . Why , thou deboshed fish , thou , was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie , being but half a fish and half a monster
Lo , how he mocks me Wilt thou let him , mylord
Lord , quoth he That a monster should be such a natural
Lo , lo , again Bite him to death , I prithee .
Trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head . If you prove a mutineer , the next tree . The poor monster’s my subject and he shall not suffer indignity .
I thank my noble lord . Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee
Marry , will I . Kneel and repeat it . I will stand , and so shall Trinculo .
Give me some music . Now , good morrow , friends . Now , good Cesario , but that piece of song , That old and antique song we heard last night . Methought it did relieve my passion much , More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy paced times Come , but one verse .
He is not here , so please your lordship , that should sing it .
Who was it
Feste , the jester , my lord , a fool that the lady Olivia’s father took much delight in . He is about the house .
Seek him out , and play the tune the while .
Come hither , boy . If ever thou shalt love , In the sweet pangs of it remember me For such as I am , all true lovers are , Unstaid and skittish in all motions else Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved . How dost thou like this tune
It gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is throned .
Why , when , I say Nay , good sweet Kate , be merry . Off with my boots , you rogues You villains , when
Sings It was the friar of orders gray , As he forth walkèd on his way A servant tries to take off PETRUCHIO’s boots . Out , you rogue You pluck my foot awry . Take that , and mend the plucking off the other . Strikes him Be merry , Kate . Some water , here , what , ho Where’s my spaniel Troilus Sirrah , get you hence And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither .
One , Kate , that you must kiss and be acquainted with . Where are my slippers Shall I have some water
Come , Kate , and wash , and welcome heartily . You whoreson villain Will you let it fall Strikes him
Patience , I pray you Twas a fault unwilling .
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee Yet am I sick for fear speak it again Twice saying ‘pardon’ doth not pardon twain , But makes one pardon strong .
With all my heart I pardon him .
A god on earth thou art .
But for our trusty brother in law and the abbot , With all the rest of that consorted crew , Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels . Good uncle , help to order several powers To Oxford , or where’er these traitors are They shall not live within this world , I swear , But I will have them , if I once know where . Uncle , farewell and , cousin too , adieu Your mother well hath pray’d , and prove you true .
Come , my old son I pray God make thee new .
There’s no trust , No faith , no honesty in men . All perjured , All forsworn , all naught , all dissemblers . Ah , where’s my man Give me some aqua vitae . These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old . Shame come to Romeo
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish He was not born to shame . Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned . Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband Ah , poor my lord , what tongue shall smooth thy name , When I , thy three hours wife , have mangled it But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin That villain cousin would have killed my husband . Back , foolish tears , back to your native spring . Your tributary drops belong to woe , Which you , mistaking , offer up to joy . My husband lives , that Tybalt would have slain , And Tybalt’s dead , that would have slain my husband . All this is comfort . Wherefore weep I then Some word there was , worser than Tybalt’s death , That murdered me . I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners minds . Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banishèd .
A whoreson , beetle headed , flap eared knave Come , Kate , sit down . I know you have a stomach . Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I What’s this Mutton
Ay .
Who brought it
I .
Tis burnt , and so is all the meat . What dogs are these Where is the rascal cook How durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not There , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all Throws the meat , & c . about the stage You heedless joltheads and unmannered slaves What , do you grumble I’ll be with you straight .
I pray you , husband , be not so disquiet . The meat was well , if you were so contented .
I tell thee , Kate , ’twas burnt and dried away . And I expressly am forbid to touch it , For it engenders choler , planteth anger And better ’twere that both of us did fast , Since of ourselves , ourselves are choleric , Than feed it with such over roasted flesh . Be patient , tomorrow ’t shall be mended , And , for this night , we’ll fast for company .
Didst thou not mark the king , what words he spake , ‘Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear ’ Was it not so
These were his very words .
‘Have I no friend ’ quoth he he spake it twice , And urged it twice together , did he not
He did .
And speaking it , he wistly look’d on me , And who should say , ‘I would thou wert the man’ That would divorce this terror from my heart ’ Meaning the king at Pomfret . Come , let’s go I am the king’s friend , and will rid his foe .
Thou dost speak masterly . My life upon ’t , young though thou art , thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves . Hath it not , boy
A little , by your favor .
What kind of woman is’t
Of your complexion .
She is not worth thee , then . What years , i faith
About your years , my lord .
Too old by heaven . Let still the woman take An elder than herself . So wears she to him , So sways she level in her husband’s heart . For , boy , however we do praise ourselves , Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm , More longing , wavering , sooner lost and worn , Than women’s are .
I think it well , my lord .
Then let thy love be younger than thyself , Or thy affection cannot hold the bent . For women are as roses , whose fair flower Being once displayed , doth fall that very hour .
And so they are . Alas , that they are so , To die even when they to perfection grow
As I told thee before , I am subject to a tyrant , a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island .
Thou liest .
Thou liest , thou jesting monkey , thou I would my valiant master would destroy thee . I do not lie .
Trinculo , if you trouble him any more in ’s tale , by this hand , I will supplant some of your teeth .
Why , I said nothing .
Mum , then , and no more . Proceed .
I have no other but a woman’s reason I think him so because I think him so .
I say , by sorcery he got this isle . From me he got it . If thy greatness will Revenge it on him for I know thou darest , But this thing dare not
That’s most certain .
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee .
How now shall this be compassed Canst thou bring me to th party
Yea , yea , my lord . I’ll yield him thee asleep , Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head .
Thou liest . Thou canst not .
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
Ay . Would you had never seen him
Ay , if you thought your love not cast away .
Come , I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .
Why , he of all the rest hath never moved me .
So would not I . My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness , his checks , his frowns Prithee , unpin me have grace and favor .
Peter , didst ever see the like
Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye .
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
He kills her in her own humor .
All’s one . Good Father , how foolish are our minds If I do die before thee , prithee , shroud me In one of these same sheets .
His little speaking shows his love but small .
Where is he
Come , come You talk
In her chamber , Making a sermon of continency to her , And rails and swears and rates , that she , poor soul , Knows not which way to stand , to look , to speak , And sits as one new risen from a dream . Away , away , for he is coming hither
That banishèd , that one word banishèd Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts . Tybalt’s death Was woe enough , if it had ended there . Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said Tybalt’s dead , Thy father or thy mother , nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death , Romeo is banishèd . To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead . Romeo is banishèd . There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word’s death . No words can that woe sound . Where is my father and my mother , Nurse
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse . Will you go to them I will bring you thither .
Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And ’tis my hope to end successfully . My falcon now is sharp and passing empty , And , till she stoop , she must not be full gorged , For then she never looks upon her lure . Another way I have to man my haggard , To make her come and know her keeper’s call .
Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all .
They do not love that do not show their love .
O , they love least that let men know their love .
I would I knew his mind .
My mother had a maid called Barbary , She was in love , and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her . She had a song of Willow , An old thing ’twas , but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it . That song tonight Will not go from my mind . I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary . Prithee , dispatch .
Shall I go fetch your nightgown
No , unpin me here . This Lodovico is a proper man .
I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself , I cannot do it yet I’ll hammer it out . My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul , My soul the father and these two beget A generation of still breeding thoughts , And these same thoughts people this little world , In humours like the people of this world , For no thought is contented . The better sort , As thoughts of things divine , are intermix’d With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word As thus , ‘Come , little ones , ’ and then again , ‘It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye . ’ Thoughts tending to ambition , they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world , my ragged prison walls , And , for they cannot , die in their own pride . Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves , Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame , That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease , Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like . Thus play I in one person many people , And none contented sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar , And so I am then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I king’d again and by and by Think that I am unking’d by Bolingbroke , And straight am nothing but whate’er I be , Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased , till he be eased With being nothing . Music do I hear
A very handsome man .
He speaks well .
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
Wilt thou , O God , fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
When holy Harry died , and my sweet son .
Dead life , blind sight , poor mortal living ghost , Woe’s scene , world’s shame , grave’s due by life usurped , Brief abstract and record of tedious days , Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth , Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood .
Ah , that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave As thou canst yield a melancholy seat , Then would I hide my bones , not rest them here . O , who hath any cause to mourn but we
If ancient sorrow be most reverend , Give mine the benefit of seigniory , And let my griefs frown on the upper hand . If sorrow can admit society , Tell o er your woes again by viewing mine . I had an Edward till a Richard killed him I had a husband till a Richard killed him . Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him .
I had a Richard too , and thou did’st kill him I had a Rutland too thou holp’st to kill him .
Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo’s banishment . Take up those cords . Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled . He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden widowèd . Come , cords . Come , Nurse . I’ll to my wedding bed . And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead
Hie to your chamber . I’ll find Romeo To comfort you . I wot well where he is . Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night . I’ll to him . He is hid at Lawrence cell .
Peruse this paper , madam .
To Julia . Say , from whom
That the contents will show .
Say , say , who gave it thee
Sir Valentine’s page and sent , I think , from Proteus . He would have given it you , but I , being in the way , Did in your name receive it . Pardon the fault , I pray .
Now , by my modesty , a goodly broker Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines To whisper and conspire against my youth Now trust me , ’tis an office of great worth , And you an officer fit for the place . There , take the paper . See it be returned , Or else return no more into my sight .
What a pied ninny’s this Thou scurvy patch I do beseech thy greatness , give him blows And take his bottle from him . When that’s gone , He shall drink naught but brine , for I’ll not show him Where the quick freshes are .
Trinculo , run into no further danger . Interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , I’ll turn my mercy out o doors and make a stockfish of thee .
Why , what did I I did nothing . I’ll go farther off .
Didst thou not say he lied
Thou liest .
As you like this , give me the lie another time .
I did not give the lie . Out o your wits and hearing too A pox o your bottle This can sack and drinking do . A murrain on your monster , and the devil take your fingers
Ha , ha , ha
Now , forward with your tale . Prithee , stand farther off .
Beat him enough . After a little time , I’ll beat him too .
Stand farther . Come , proceed .
That is , to watch her , as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient . She ate no meat today , nor none shall eat . Last night she slept not , nor tonight she shall not . As with the meat , some undeservèd fault I’ll find about the making of the bed , And here I’ll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets . Ay , and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her . And , in conclusion , she shall watch all night , And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl , And with the clamor keep her still awake . This is a way to kill a wife with kindness , And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humor . He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak ’tis charity to show .
Ha , ha keep time how sour sweet music is , When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of men’s lives . And here have I the daintiness of ear To cheque time broke in a disorder’d string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke . I wasted time , and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbering clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes , the outward watch , Whereto my finger , like a dial’s point , Is pointing still , in cleansing them from tears . Now sir , the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans , which strike upon my heart , Which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans Show minutes , times , and hours but my time Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy , While I stand fooling here , his Jack o’ the clock . This music mads me let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits , In me it seems it will make wise men mad . Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For ’tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this all hating world .
O , find him Give this ring to my true knight , And bid him come to take his last farewell .
O , fellow , come , the song we had last night . Mark it , Cesario , it is old and plain The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it . It is silly sooth , And dallies with the innocence of love , Like the old age .
Are you ready , sir
Ay prithee , sing .
Come away , come away , death , And in sad cypress let me be laid . Fly away , fly away breath , I am slain by a fair cruel maid . My shroud of white , stuck all with yew , O , prepare it My part of death , no one so true Did share it . Not a flower , not a flower sweet On my black coffin let there be strown . Not a friend , not a friend greet My poor corpse , where my bones shall be thrown . A thousand thousand sighs to save , Lay me , O , where Sad true lover never find my grave , To weep there
There’s for thy pains .
Is ’t possible , friend Litio , that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio I tell you , sir , she bears me fair in hand .
Sir , to satisfy you in what I have said , Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching . They stand aside
Now , mistress , profit you in what you read
What , master , read you First resolve me that .
I read that I profess , The Art to Love .
And may you prove , sir , master of your art .
While you , sweet dear , prove mistress of my heart
Quick proceeders , marry Now , tell me , I pray , You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio .
O despiteful love Unconstant womankind I tell thee , Litio , this is wonderful
Thou hadst a Clarence too , and Richard killed him Then forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death That dog , that had his teeth before his eyes , To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood That excellent grand tyrant of the earth , That reigns in gallèd eyes of weeping souls That foul defacer of God’s handiwork Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves . O upright , just , and true disposing God , How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body And makes her pew fellow with others moan
O Harry’s wife , triumph not in my woes God witness with me , I have wept for thine .
Bear with me , I am hungry for revenge , And now I cloy me with beholding it . Thy Edward he is dead , that killed my Edward , Thy other Edward dead , to quit my Edward Young York , he is but boot , because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss . Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward , And the beholders of this frantic play , Th adulterate Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey , Untimely smothered in their dusky graves . Richard yet lives , hell’s black intelligencer , Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither . But at hand , at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end . Earth gapes , hell burns , fiends roar , saints pray , To have him suddenly conveyed from hence . Cancel his bond of life , dear God I pray , That I may live to say , The dog is dead .
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate .
Will ye be gone
That you may ruminate .
And yet I would I had o’erlooked the letter . It were a shame to call her back again And pray her to a fault for which I chid her . What fool is she , that knows I am a maid And would not force the letter to my view Since maids , in modesty , say no to that Which they would have the profferer construe ay . Fie , fie , how wayward is this foolish love That , like a testy babe , will scratch the nurse And presently , all humbled , kiss the rod How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence , When willingly I would have had her here How angerly I taught my brow to frown , When inward joy enforced my heart to smile My penance is to call Lucetta back And ask remission for my folly past . What ho Lucetta
What would your ladyship
Mistake no more . I am not Litio , Nor a musician as I seem to be , But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentlema And makes a god of such a cullion . Know , sir , that I am called Hortensio .
Signior Hortensio , I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca , And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness , I will with you , if you be so contented , Forswear Bianca and her love for ever .
See how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio , Here is my hand , and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more , but do forswear her As one unworthy all the former favors That I have fondly flattered her withal .
And here I take the like unfeignèd oath Never to marry with her , though she would entreat . Fie on her See how beastly she doth court him
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow , Ere three days pass , which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard . And so farewell , Signior Lucentio . Kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , Shall win my love , and so I take my leave , In resolution as I swore before .
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree , Sing all a green willow . Her hand on her bosom , her head on her knee , Sing willow , willow , willow . The fresh streams ran by her , and murmured her moans , Sing willow , willow , willow . Her salt tears fell from her , and softened the stones Sing willow , willow , willow Lay by these Willow , willow Prithee , hie thee , he’ll come anon Sing all a green willow must be my garland . Let nobody blame him , his scorn I approve Nay , that’s not next Hark Who is ’t that knocks
It’s the wind .
I called my love false love but what said he then Sing willow , willow , willow . If I court more women you’ll couch with more men So , get thee gone , good night . Mine eyes do itch , Doth that bode weeping
Tis neither here nor there .
I have heard it said so . Oh , these men , these men Dost thou in conscience think tell me , Emilia That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind
There be some such , no question .
Romeo , come forth . Come forth , thou fearful man . Affliction is enamoured of thy parts , And thou art wedded to calamity .
Father , what news What is the Prince’s doom What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand That I yet know not
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company . I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom .
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom
A gentler judgment vanished from his lips Not body’s death , but body’s banishment .
Ha , banishment Be merciful , say death , For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death . Do not say banishment .
Hence from Verona art thou banishèd . Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself . Hence banishèd is banished from the world , And world’s exile is death . Then banishèd ,
Why , as I told thee , ’tis a custom with him , I th afternoon to sleep . There thou mayst brain him , Having first seized his books or with a log Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake Or cut his weasand with thy knife . Remember First to possess his books , for without them He’s but a sot , as I am , nor hath not One spirit to command . They all do hate him As rootedly as I . Burn but his books . He has brave utensils for so he calls them Which when he has a house , he’ll deck withal . And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter . He himself Calls her a nonpareil . I never saw a woman , But only Sycorax my dam and she . But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least .
Is it so brave a lass
Ay , lord . She will become thy bed , I warrant . And bring thee forth brave brood .
Monster , I will kill this man . His daughter and I will be king and queen save our graces and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys . Dost thou like the plot , Trinculo
Excellent .
Give me thy hand . I am sorry I beat thee . But while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
Within this half hour will he be asleep . Wilt thou destroy him then
No pains , sir . I take pleasure in singing , sir .
I’ll pay thy pleasure then .
Truly , sir , and pleasure will be paid , one time or another .
Give me now leave to leave thee .
Now , the melancholy god protect thee , and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta , for thy mind is a very opal . I would have men of such constancy put to sea , that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere , for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing . Farewell .
Let all the rest give place .
Mistress Bianca , bless you with such grace As longeth to a lover’s blessèd case Nay , I have ta en you napping , gentle love , And have forsworn you with Hortensio .
Tranio , you jest . But have you both forsworn me
Mistress , we have .
Once more , Cesario , Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty . Tell her my love , more noble than the world , Prizes not quantity of dirty lands The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her , Tell her , I hold as giddily as fortune But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
Then we are rid of Litio .
But if she cannot love you , sir
I faith , he’ll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day .
God give him joy
Ay , and he’ll tame her .
He says so , Tranio
Faith , he is gone unto the taming school .
The taming school What , is there such a place
Ay , mistress , and Petruchio is the master , That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue .
Hail , royal prince
Thanks , noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear . What art thou and how comest thou hither , Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live
I was a poor groom of thy stable , king , When thou wert king who , travelling towards York , With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal master’s face . O , how it yearn’d my heart when I beheld In London streets , that coronation day , When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary , That horse that thou so often hast bestrid , That horse that I so carefully have dress’d
Rode he on Barbary Tell me , gentle friend , How went he under him
So proudly as if he disdain’d the ground .
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him . Would he not stumble would he not fall down , Since pride must have a fall , and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back Forgiveness , horse why do I rail on thee , Since thou , created to be awed by man , Wast born to bear I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burthen like an ass , Spurr’d , gall’d and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke .
Is ’t near dinner time
I would it were , That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid .
What is ’t that you took up so gingerly
Nothing .
Why didst thou stoop , then
To take a paper up that I let fall .
And is that paper nothing
Nothing concerning me .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
O , thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider , that foul bunch backed toad
Then let it lie for those that it concerns .
Why , would not you
Madam , it will not lie where it concerns , Unless it have a false interpreter .
No , by this heavenly light
I called thee then vain flourish of my fortune . I called thee then poor shadow , painted queen , The presentation of but what I was , The flattering index of a direful pageant , One heaved a high , to be hurled down below , A mother only mocked with two fair babes , A dream of what thou wast , a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot , A sign of dignity , a breath , a bubble , A queen in jest , only to fill the scene . Where is thy husband now Where be thy brothers Where are thy two sons Wherein dost thou joy Who sues and kneels and says God save the queen Where be the bending peers that flattered thee Where be the thronging troops that followed thee Decline all this , and see what now thou art For happy wife , a most distressèd widow For joyful mother , one that wails the name For queen , a very caitiff crowned with care For she that scorned at me , now scorned of me For she being feared of all , now fearing one For she commanding all , obeyed of none . Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time , Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more , being what thou art . Thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke , From which even here I slip my weary head And leave the burthen of it all on thee . Farewell , York’s wife , and queen of sad mischance . These English woes will make me smile in France .
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme .
Nor I neither , by this heavenly light . I might do ’t as well i th dark .
That I might sing it , madam , to a tune , Give me a note your ladyship can set .
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
As little by such toys as may be possible . Best sing it to the tune of Light o’ Love .
The world’s a huge thing . It is a great price for a small vice .
It is too heavy for so light a tune .
In troth , I think thou wouldst not .
Heavy Belike it hath some burden then
In troth , I think I should , and undo ’t when I had done . Marry , I would not do such a thing for a joint ring , nor for measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition . But for the whole world Why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch I should venture purgatory for ’t .
Ay , and melodious were it , would you sing it .
Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong For the whole world .
And why not you
Why the wrong is but a wrong i th world , and having the world for your labor , ’tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .
I do not think there is any such woman .
Yes , a dozen , and as many to th vantage as would store the world they played for . But I do think it is their husbands faults If wives do fall . Say that they slack their duties
O master , master , I have watched so long That I am dog weary , but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn .
What is he , Biondello
Master , a marcantant , or a pedant , I know not what , but formal in apparel , In gait and countenance surely like a father .
And what of him , Tranio
If he be credulous and trust my tale , I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio And give assurance to Baptista Minola As if he were the right Vincentio . Take in your love , and then let me alone .
God save you , sir .
And you , sir . You are welcome . Travel you far on , or are you at the farthest
Sir , at the farthest for a week or two , But then up farther , and as far as Rome , And so to Tripoli , if God lend me life .
Is death mistermed . Calling death banishment , Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness Thy fault our law calls death , but the kind Prince , Taking thy part , hath rushed aside the law , And turned that black word death to banishment . This is dear mercy , and thou seest it not .
Tis torture and not mercy . Heaven is here , Where Juliet lives , and every cat and dog And little mouse , every unworthy thing , Live here in heaven and may look on her , But Romeo may not . More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo . They may seize On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand And steal immortal blessing from her lips , Who even in pure and vestal modesty , Still blush , as thinking their own kisses sin . But Romeo may not . He is banishèd . Flies may do this , but I from this must fly . They are free men , but I am banishèd . And sayst thou yet that exile is not death Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne er so mean , But banishèd to kill me Banishèd O Friar , the damnèd use that word in hell . Howling attends it . How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word banishèd
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
I cannot be so answer’d .
Sooth , but you must . Say that some lady , as perhaps there is , Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia . You cannot love her . You tell her so . Must she not then be answered
There is no woman’s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart . No woman’s heart So big , to hold so much . They lack retention . Alas , their love may be called appetite , No motion of the liver , but the palate , That suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea , And can digest as much . Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia .
Ay , but I know
What dost thou know
Too well what love women to men may owe . In faith , they are as true of heart as we . My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be , perhaps , were I a woman , I should your lordship .
And what’s her history
I cannot reach so high .
Let’s see your song . How now , minion
Ay , on mine honor .
This will I tell my master .
Thou makest me merry . I am full of pleasure . Let us be jocund . Will you troll the catch You taught me but whilere
At thy request , monster , I will do reason , any reason . Come on , Trinculo , let us sing . Flout em and scout em , And scout em and flout em . Thought is free .
That’s not the tune .
What is this same
This is the tune of our catch , played by the picture of Nobody .
If thou beest a man , show thyself in thy likeness . If thou beest a devil , take ’t as thou list .
O , forgive me my sins
He that dies pays all debts . I defy thee Mercy upon us
Art thou afeard
Fellow , give place here is no longer stay .
If thou love me , ’tis time thou wert away .
Keep tune there still so you will sing it out . And yet methinks I do not like this tune .
You do not
No , madam , ’tis too sharp .
You , minion , are too saucy .
Nay , now you are too flat , And mar the concord with too harsh a descant . There wanteth but a mean to fill your song .
The mean is drowned with your unruly bass .
Indeed , I bid the base for Proteus .
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me . Here is a coil with protestation
Go , get you gone , and let the papers lie . You would be fing’ring them to anger me .
She makes it strange , but she would be best pleased To be so angered with another letter .
Nay , would I were so angered with the same
What my tongue dares not , that my heart shall say .
My lord , will’t please you to fall to
Taste of it first , as thou art wont to do .
My lord , I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton , who lately came from the king , commands the contrary .
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee Patience is stale , and I am weary of it .
Help , help , help
How now what means death in this rude assault Villain , thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument .
Go thou , and fill another room in hell .
That hand shall burn in never quenching fire That staggers thus my person . Exton , thy fierce hand Hath with the king’s blood stain’d the king’s own land . Mount , mount , my soul thy seat is up on high Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward , here to die .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word Adversity’s sweet milk , philosophy To comfort thee though thou art banishèd .
Yet banishèd Hang up philosophy Unless philosophy can make a Juliet , Displant a town , reverse a prince’s doom , It helps not , it prevails not . Talk no more .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel . Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murderèd , Doting like me , and like me banishèd , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .
Arise . One knocks . Good Romeo , hide thyself .
And pour our treasures into foreign laps , Or else break out in peevish jealousies , Throwing restraint upon us . Or say they strike us , Or scant our former having in despite . Why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , Yet have we some revenge . Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them . They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour , As husbands have . What is it that they do When they change us for others Is it sport I think it is . And doth affection breed it I think it doth . Is ’t frailty that thus errs It is so too . And have not we affections , Desires for sport , and frailty , as men have Then let them use us well , else let them know , The ills we do , their ills instruct us so .
Good night , good night . Heaven me such uses send , Not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend
O , thou well skilled in curses , stay awhile , And teach me how to curse mine enemies .
Forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days Compare dead happiness with living woe Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were , And he that slew them fouler than he is . Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse . Revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
My words are dull . O , quicken them with thine
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine .
Why should calamity be full of words
Windy attorneys to their clients woes , Airy succeeders of intestate joys , Poor breathing orators of miseries , Let them have scope , though what they will impart Help nothing else , yet do they ease the heart .
If so , then be not tongue tied . Go with me , And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered .
The trumpet sounds . Be copious in exclaims .
A blank , my lord . She never told her love , But let concealment , like a worm i the bud , Feed on her damask cheek . She pined in thought , And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like patience on a monument , Smiling at grief . Was not this love indeed We men may say more , swear more , but indeed Our shows are more than will , for still we prove Much in our vows , but little in our love .
No , monster , not I .
O hateful hands , to tear such loving words Injurious wasps , to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings I’ll kiss each several paper for amends . Look , here is writ kind Julia . Unkind Julia As in revenge of thy ingratitude , I throw thy name against the bruising stones , Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain .
And here is writ love wounded Proteus . Poor wounded name My bosom as a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss . But twice or thrice was Proteus written down . Be calm , good wind , blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter , Except mine own name that some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged , fearful , hanging rock And throw it thence into the raging sea Lo , here in one line is his name twice writ , Poor forlorn Proteus , passionate Proteus , To the sweet Julia . That I’ll tear away And yet I will not , sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names . Thus will I fold them , one upon another . Now kiss , embrace , contend , do what you will .
But died thy sister of her love , my boy
As full of valour as of royal blood Both have I spill’d O would the deed were good For now the devil , that told me I did well , Says that this deed is chronicled in hell . This dead king to the living king I’ll bear Take hence the rest , and give them burial here .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .
Hark , how they knock Who’s there Romeo , arise . Thou wilt be taken . Stay awhile . Stand up .
Be not afeard . The isle is full of noises , Sounds , and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not . Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears , and sometime voices That , if I then had waked after long sleep , Will make me sleep again . And then , in dreaming , The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me , that when I waked I cried to dream again .
Run to my study . By and by God’s will , What simpleness is this I come , I come .
Who knocks so hard Whence come you What’s your will
Let me come in , and you shall know my errand . I come from Lady Juliet .
I am all the daughters of my father’s house , And all the brothers too and yet I know not . Sir , shall I to this lady
This will prove a brave kingdom to me , where I shall have my music for nothing .
Ay , that’s the theme . To her in haste . Give her this jewel . Say My love can give no place , bide no denay .
When Prospero is destroyed .
That shall be by and by . I remember the story .
The sound is going away . Let’s follow it , and after do our work .
Lead , monster we’ll follow . I would I could see this taborer . He lays it on .
Wilt come I’ll follow , Stephano .
Welcome then .
What countryman , I pray
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady’s lord Where’s Romeo
Of Mantua .
Of Mantua , sir Marry , God forbid And come to Padua , careless of your life
My life , sir how , I pray For that goes hard .
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua . Know you not the cause Your ships are stayed at Venice , and the Duke , For private quarrel ’twixt your duke and him , Hath published and proclaimed it openly . Tis marvel , but that you are but newly come , You might have heard it else proclaimed about .
Alas , sir , it is worse for me than so , For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence , and must here deliver them .
Well , sir , to do you courtesy , This will I do , and this I will advise you . First tell me , have you ever been at Pisa
Ay , sir , in Pisa have I often been , Pisa renownèd for grave citizens .
Among them know you one Vincentio
I know him not , but I have heard of him A merchant of incomparable wealth .
Who intercepts my expedition
O , she that might have intercepted thee , By strangling thee in her accursèd womb , From all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done .
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded , if that right were right , The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers Tell me , thou villain slave , where are my children
Thou toad , thou toad , where is thy brother Clarence And little Ned Plantagenet his son
Where is gentle Rivers , Vaughan , Grey
Where is kind Hastings
A flourish , trumpets Strike alarum , drums Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed . Strike , I say
Either be patient and entreat me fair , Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations .
Art thou my son
Kind uncle York , the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consumed with fire Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire But whether they be ta’en or slain we hear not .
Welcome , my lord what is the news
Madam , Dinner is ready , and your father stays .
Well , let us go .
First , to thy sacred state wish I all happiness . The next news is , I have to London sent The heads of Oxford , Salisbury , Blunt , and Kent The manner of their taking may appear At large discoursed in this paper here .
What , shall these papers lie like telltales here
We thank thee , gentle Percy , for thy pains And to thy worth will add right worthy gains .
If you respect them , best to take them up .
Nay , I was taken up for laying them down Yet here they shall not lie , for catching cold .
My lord , I have from Oxford sent to London The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely , Two of the dangerous consorted traitors That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow .
Thy pains , Fitzwater , shall not be forgot Right noble is thy merit , well I wot .
I see you have a month’s mind to them .
Ay , madam , you may say what sights you see I see things too , although you judge I wink .
Come , come will ’t please you go
Here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come . Wear thy good rapier bare , and put it home . Quick , quick Fear nothing . I’ll be at thy elbow . It makes us , or it mars us . Think on that , And fix most firm thy resolution .
Be near at hand , I may miscarry in ’t .
Here , at thy hand . Be bold , and take thy stand .
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons . Tis but a man gone . Forth , my sword he dies .
I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense , And he grows angry . Now , whether he kill Cassio Or Cassio him , or each do kill the other , Every way makes my gain . Live Roderigo , He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him As gifts to Desdemona . It must not be . If Cassio do remain He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly . And besides , the Moor May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril . No , he must die . But so , I hear him coming .
Tell me , Panthino , what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
’Twas of his nephew Proteus , your son .
Why , what of him
He wondered that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home , While other men , of slender reputation , Put forth their sons to seek preferment out , Some to the wars , to try their fortune there , Some to discover islands far away , Some to the studious universities . For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet , And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home , Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youth .
Come thy ways , Signior Fabian .
Nay , I’ll come . If I lose a scruple of this sport , let me be boiled to death with melancholy .
Nor need’st thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering . I have considered well his loss of time , And how he cannot be a perfect man , Not being tried and tutored in the world . Experience is by industry achieved And perfected by the swift course of time . Then tell me , whither were I best to send him
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep biter come by some notable shame
I would exult , man . You know , he brought me out o favor with my lady about a bear baiting here .
To anger him , we’ll have the bear again , and we will fool him black and blue . Shall we not , Sir Andrew
An we do not , it is pity of our lives .
By r lakin , I can go no further , sir . My old bones ache . Here’s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders . By your patience , I needs must rest me .
Here comes the little villain .
How now , my metal of India
Old lord , I cannot blame thee , Who am myself attached with weariness To th dulling of my spirits . Sit down and rest . Even here I will put off my hope and keep it No longer for my flatterer . He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land . Well , let him go .
Get you all three into the boxtree . Malvolio’s coming down this walk . He has been yonder i the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour . Observe him , for the love of mockery , for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him . Close , in the name of jesting
I am right glad that he’s so out of hope . Do not for one repulse forego the purpose That you resolved t effect .
The next advantage Will we take throughly .
Let it be tonight , For now they are oppressed with travel . They Will not , nor cannot , use such vigilance As when they are fresh .
There on the ground , with his own tears made drunk .
Oh , he is even in my mistress case , Just in her case . O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . Stand up , stand up . Stand , an you be a man . For Juliet’s sake , for her sake , rise and stand . Why should you fall into so deep an O
Nurse
Ah sir , ah sir . Death’s the end of all .
Spakest thou of Juliet How is it with her Doth she not think me an old murderer , Now I have stained the childhood of our joy With blood removed but little from her own Where is she And how doth she And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love
Oh , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps , And now falls on her bed , and then starts up , And Tybalt calls , and then on Romeo cries , And then down falls again .
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name’s cursed hand Murdered her kinsman . O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .
The grand conspirator , Abbot of Westminster , With clog of conscience and sour melancholy Hath yielded up his body to the grave But here is Carlisle living , to abide Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride .
Carlisle , this is your doom Choose out some secret place , some reverend room , More than thou hast , and with it joy thy life So as thou livest in peace , die free from strife For though mine enemy thou hast ever been , High sparks of honour in thee have I seen .
Great king , within this coffin I present Thy buried fear herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies , Richard of Bordeaux , by me hither brought .
Exton , I thank thee not for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land .
From your own mouth , my lord , did I this deed .
He is my father , sir , and sooth to say , In count nance somewhat doth resemble you .
As much as an apple doth an oyster , and all one .
To save your life in this extremity , This favor will I do you for his sake And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio His name and credit shall you undertake , And in my house you shall be friendly lodged . Look that you take upon you as you should . You understand me , sir . So shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city . If this be court’sy , sir , accept of it .
O sir , I do , and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty .
Then go with me to make the matter good . This , by the way , I let you understand My father is here looked for every day To pass assurance of a dower in marriage Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here . In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you . Go with me to clothe you as becomes you .
They love not poison that do poison need , Nor do I thee though I did wish him dead , I hate the murderer , love him murdered . The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour , But neither my good word nor princely favour With Cain go wander through shades of night , And never show thy head by day nor light .
Ay , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
Then patiently hear my impatience .
Madam , I have a touch of your condition , Which cannot brook the accent of reproof .
O , let me speak
Do then , but I’ll not hear .
I will be mild and gentle in my words .
And brief , good mother , for I am in haste .
I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion , youthful Valentine , Attends the Emperor in his royal court .
Art thou so hasty I have stayed for thee , God knows , in torment and in agony .
I know it well .
And came I not at last to comfort you
’Twere good , I think , your lordship sent him thither . There shall he practice tilts and tournaments , Hear sweet discourse , converse with noblemen , And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth .
No , by the Holy Rood , thou know’st it well . Thou cam’st on earth to make the earth my hell . A grievous burden was thy birth to me Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy Thy school days frightful , desp rate , wild , and furious Thy prime of manhood daring , bold , and venturous Thy age confirmed , proud , subtle , sly , and bloody , More mild , but yet more harmful , kind in hatred . What comfortable hour canst thou name , That ever graced me in thy company
I like thy counsel well hast thou advised And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it , The execution of it shall make known . Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the Emperor’s court .
Tomorrow , may it please you , Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem Are journeying to salute the Emperor And to commend their service to his will .
Good company . With them shall Proteus go–
And in good time Now will we break with him .
Sweet love , sweet lines , sweet life Here is her hand , the agent of her heart Here is her oath for love , her honor’s pawn . O , that our fathers would applaud our loves , To seal our happiness with their consents O heavenly Julia
Lie thou there , for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling .
I say , tonight . No more .
Tis but fortune , all is fortune . Maria once told me she did affect me , and I have heard herself come thus near , that , should she fancy , it should be one of my complexion . Besides , she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her . What should I think on ’t
What harmony is this My good friends , hark
Here’s an overweening rogue
Marvelous sweet music
O , peace Contemplation makes a rare turkey cock of him . How he jets under his advanced plumes
Slight , I could so beat the rogue
Give us kind keepers , heavens What were these
Peace , I say .
A living drollery . Now I will believe That there are unicorns , that in Arabia There is one tree , the phoenix throne , one phoenix At this hour reigning there .
To be Count Malvolio
I’ll believe both And what does else want credit , come to me , And I’ll be sworn ’tis true . Travelers ne er did lie , Though fools at home condemn em .
Ah , rogue
Pistol him , pistol him .
If in Naples I should report this now , would they believe me If I should say , I saw such islanders For , certes , these are people of the island Who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet note , Their manners are more gentle kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many nay , almost any .
Peace , peace
Honest lord , Thou hast said well , for some of you there present Are worse than devils .
Hold thy desperate hand . Art thou a man Thy form cries out thou art . Thy tears are womanish . Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast . Unseemly woman in a seeming man , And ill beseeming beast in seeming both Thou hast amazed me . By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered . Hast thou slain Tybalt Wilt thou slay thyself , And slay thy lady that in thy life lives By doing damnèd hate upon thyself Why rail’st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth Since birth and heaven and earth , all three do meet In thee at once , which thou at once wouldst lose Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound’st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit . Thy noble shape is but a form of wax , Digressing from the valor of a man Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury , Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish Thy wit , that ornament to shape and love , Misshapen in the conduct of them both , Like powder in a skill less soldier’s flask , Is set afire by thine own ignorance And thou dismembered with thine own defence . What , rouse thee , man Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead There art thou happy . Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew’st Tybalt there art thou happy . The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile there art thou happy . A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,
How now What letter are you reading there
May ’t please your lordship , ’tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine , Delivered by a friend that came from him .
I know his gait , ’tis he . Villain , thou diest
There is example for ’t . The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe .
Fie on him , Jezebel
O , peace Now he’s deeply in . Look how imagination blows him .
Having been three months married to her , sitting in my state
Lend me the letter . Let me see what news .
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed But that my coat is better than thou know’st I will make proof of thine .
Oh , for a stone bow , to hit him in the eye
There is no news , my lord , but that he writes How happily he lives , how well beloved And daily gracèd by the Emperor Wishing me with him , partner of his fortune .
And how stand you affected to his wish
Calling my officers about me , in my branched velvet gown , having come from a daybed , where I have left Olivia sleeping
Oh , I am slain
Fire and brimstone
As one relying on your lordship’s will , And not depending on his friendly wish .
I am maimed for ever . Help , ho Murder Murder
O , peace , peace
And then to have the humor of state , and after a demure travel of regard , telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs , to ask for my kinsman Toby
Bolts and shackles
O peace , peace , peace Now , now .
My will is something sorted with his wish . Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed , For what I will , I will , and there an end . I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the Emperor’s court . What maintenance he from his friends receives , Like exhibition thou shalt have from me . Tomorrow be in readiness to go . Excuse it not , for I am peremptory .
My lord , I cannot be so soon provided . Please you , deliberate a day or two .
Lords , I protest , my soul is full of woe , That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow Come , mourn with me for that I do lament , And put on sullen black incontinent I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Land , To wash this blood off from my guilty hand March sadly after grace my mournings here In weeping after this untimely bier .
Faith , none but Humfrey Hower , that called your Grace To breakfast once , forth of my company . If I be so disgracious in your eye , Let me march on and not offend you , madam . Strike up the drum .
I prithee , hear me speak .
You speak too bitterly .
Hear me a word , For I shall never speak to thee again .
So .
Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror , Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish And nevermore behold thy face again . Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse , Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armor that thou wear’st . My prayers on the adverse party fight , And there the little souls of Edward’s children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory . Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end . Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend .
The voice of Cassio . Iago keeps his word .
Oh , villain that I am
It is even so .
Oh , help , ho Light A surgeon
Tis he . Oh , brave Iago , honest and just , That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong
I cannot too much muse Such shapes , such gesture , and such sound , expressing , Although they want the use of tongue , a kind Of excellent dumb discourse .
Praise in departing .
No , no , forsooth , I dare not for my life .
They vanished strangely .
The more my wrong , the more his spite appears . What , did he marry me to famish me Beggars that come unto my father’s door Upon entreaty have a present alms . If not , elsewhere they meet with charity . But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed . And that which spites me more than all these wants , He does it under name of perfect love , As who should say , if I should sleep or eat , Twere deadly sickness or else present death . I prithee , go and get me some repast , I care not what , so it be wholesome food .
What say you to a neat’s foot
Tis passing good . I prithee let me have it .
I fear it is too choleric a meat . How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled
I like it well . Good Grumio , fetch it me .
I cannot tell . I fear ’tis choleric . What say you to a piece of beef and mustard
A dish that I do love to feed upon .
No matter , since They have left their viands behind , for we have stomachs . Will ’t please you taste of what is here
Not I .
Faith , sir , you need not fear . When we were boys , Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls , whose throats had hanging at em Wallets of flesh , or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find Each putter out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of .
I will stand to and feed , Although my last . No matter , since I feel The best is past . Brother , my lord the duke , Stand to and do as we .
Though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me . I say amen to her .
Stay , madam . I must talk a word with you .
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter . For my daughters , Richard , They shall be praying nuns , not weeping queens , And therefore level not to hit their lives .
You have a daughter called Elizabeth , Virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
And must she die for this O , let her live , And I’ll corrupt her manners , stain her beauty , Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed , Throw over her the veil of infamy . So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter , I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter .
Wrong not her birth . She is a royal princess .
To save her life , I’ll say she is not so .
Her life is safest only in her birth .
And only in that safety died her brothers .
Lo , at their births good stars were opposite .
No , to their lives ill friends were contrary .
All unavoided is the doom of destiny .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout’st upon thy fortune and thy love . Take heed , take heed , for such die miserable . Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed . Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her . But look thou stay not till the watch be set , For then thou canst not pass to Mantua , Where thou shalt live , till we can find a time To blaze your marriage , reconcile your friends , Beg pardon of the Prince , and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went’st forth in lamentation . Go before , Nurse . Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto . Romeo is coming .
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel . Oh , what learning is My lord , I’ll tell my lady you will come .
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir . Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
How well my comfort is revived by this
You fools , I and my fellows Are ministers of fate . The elements Of whom your swords are tempered may as well Wound the loud winds or with bemocked at stabs Kill the still closing waters as diminish One dowl that’s in my plume . My fellow ministers Are like invulnerable . If you could hurt , Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted . But remember For that’s my business to you that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero , Exposed unto the sea , which hath requit it , Him and his innocent child . For which foul deed The powers delaying , not forgetting have Incensed the seas and shores , yea , all the creatures , Against your peace . Thee of thy son , Alonso , They have bereft , and do pronounce by me Lingering perdition , worse than any death Can be at once , shall step by step attend You and your ways whose wraths to guard you from Which here , in this most desolate isle , else falls Upon your heads is nothing but hearts sorrow And a clear life ensuing .
Seven of my people , with an obedient start , make out for him . I frown the while , and perchance wind up watch , or play with my some rich jewel . Toby approaches , curtsies there to me
Shall this fellow live
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars , yet peace .
I extend my hand to him thus , quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control
And does not Toby take you a blow o the lips then
Saying , Cousin Toby , my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech
What , what
You must amend your drunkenness .
Out , scab
Nay , patience , or we break the sinews of our plot .
Besides , you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight
That’s me , I warrant you .
One Sir Andrew
Look what thou want’st shall be sent after thee . No more of stay . Tomorrow thou must go . Come on , Panthino you shall be employed To hasten on his expedition .
Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning , And drenched me in the sea , where I am drowned . I feared to show my father Julia’s letter Lest he should take exceptions to my love , And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love . O , how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day , Which now shows all the beauty of the sun , And by and by a cloud takes all away
Sir Proteus , your father calls for you . He is in haste therefore , I pray you , go .
Why , this it is my heart accords thereto , And yet a thousand times it answers no .
Ay , but the mustard is too hot a little .
Why then , the beef , and let the mustard rest .
Nay then , I will not . You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio .
Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt .
Why then , the mustard without the beef .
Go , get thee gone , thou false deluding slave , Beats him That feed’st me with the very name of meat . Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you That triumph thus upon my misery . Go , get thee gone , I say .
How fares my Kate What , sweeting , all amort
Mistress , what cheer
Faith , as cold as can be .
Pluck up thy spirits . Look cheerfully upon me . Here love , thou seest how diligent I am , To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee . I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness merits thanks . What , not a word Nay , then thou lov’st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof . Here , take away this dish .
Thou teachest me . Minion , your dear lies dead , And your unblest fate hies . Strumpet , I come . For , of my heart , those charms , thine eyes , are blotted . Thy bed , lust stained , shall with lust’s blood be spotted .
What , ho No watch No passage Murder Murder
Tis some mischance , the cry is very direful .
Oh , help
Hark
Oh , wretched villain
Two or three groan . Tis heavy night , These may be counterfeits . Let’s think ’t unsafe To come in to the cry without more help .
Nobody come Then shall I bleed to death .
Hark
Here’s one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
Who’s there Whose noise is this that ones on murder
If you shall chance , Camillo , to visit Bohemia , on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot , you shall see , as I have said , great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia .
I think , this coming summer , the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him .
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed
Beseech you ,
Verily , I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we cannot with such magnificence in so rare I know not what to say . We will give you sleepy drinks , that your senses , unintelligent of our insufficience , may , though they cannot praise us , as little accuse us .
You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely .
Believe me , I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance .
Sicilia cannot show himself over kind to Bohemia . They were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection , which cannot choose but branch now . Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society , their encounters , though not personal , have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts , letters , loving embassies that they have seemed to be together , though absent , shook hands , as over a vast , and embraced , as it were , from the ends of opposed winds . The heavens continue their loves
I knew ’twas I , for many do call me fool .
What employment have we here
Now is the woodcock near the gin .
O , peace And the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him
By my life , this is my lady’s hand these be her very C’s , her U’s and her T’s and thus makes she her great P’s . It is , in contempt of question , her hand .
Her C’s , her U’s and her T’s . Why that
To the unknown beloved , this , and my good wishes Her very phrases By your leave , wax . Soft And the impressure her Lucrece , with which she uses to seal . Tis my lady . To whom should this be
This wins him , liver and all .
Jove knows I love , But who Lips , do not move No man must know .
Go hence . Good night . And here stands all your state Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence . Sojourn in Mantua . I’ll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here . Give me thy hand . Tis late . Farewell , good night .
But that a joy past joy calls out on me , It were a grief so brief to part with thee . Farewell .
True , when avoided grace makes destiny . My babes were destined to a fairer death If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life .
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins .
Cousins , indeed , and by their uncle cozened Of comfort , kingdom , kindred , freedom , life . Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts , Thy head , all indirectly , gave direction . No doubt the murd rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart , To revel in the entrails of my lambs . But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes , And I , in such a desp rate bay of death , Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft , Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Performed , my Ariel . A grace it had , devouring . Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say . So with good life And observation strange , my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done . My high charms work And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions . They now are in my power , And in these fits I leave them while I visit Young Ferdinand , whom they suppose is drowned , And his and mine loved darling .
I th name of something holy , sir , why stand you In this strange stare
Oh , it is monstrous , monstrous . Methought the billows spoke and told me of it , The winds did sing it to me , and the thunder , That deep and dreadful organ pipe , pronounced The name of Prosper . It did bass my trespass . Therefore my son i th ooze is bedded , and I’ll seek him deeper than e er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded .
Madam , so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed
What good is covered with the face of heaven , To be discovered , that can do me good
The advancement of your children , gentle lady .
Up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads .
Unto the dignity and height of fortune , The high imperial type of this earth’s glory .
Sir , your glove .
Not mine . My gloves are on .
Why , then , this may be yours , for this is but one .
Ha let me see . Ay , give it me , it’s mine . Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine Ah , Sylvia , Sylvia
Madam Sylvia Madam Sylvia
How now , sirrah
She is not within hearing , sir .
Why , sir , who bade you call her
Your worship , sir , or else I mistook .
Well , you’ll still be too forward .
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow .
Go to , sir . Tell me , do you know Madam Sylvia
She that your worship loves
Why , how know you that I am in love
Marry , by these special marks first , you have learned , like Sir Proteus , to wreath your arms , like a malcontent to relish a love song , like a robin redbreast to walk alone , like one that had the pestilence to sigh , like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C to weep , like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast , like one that takes diet to watch , like one that fears robbing to speak puling , like a beggar at Hallowmas . You were wont , when you laughed , to crow like a cock when you walked , to walk like one of the lions when you fasted , it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly , it was for want of money . And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress , that when I look on you , I can hardly think you my master .
Are all these things perceived in me
They are all perceived without ye .
Without me They cannot .
Without you Nay , that’s certain , for , without you were so simple , none else would . But you are so without these follies that these follies are within you , and shine through you like the water in an urinal , that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady .
No man must know . What follows The numbers altered . No man must know . If this should be thee , Malvolio
Marry , hang thee , brock
I may command where I adore , But silence , like a Lucrece knife , With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore M . O . A . I . doth sway my life .
A fustian riddle
Excellent wench , say I .
M . O . A . I . doth sway my life . Nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
What dish o poison has she dressed him
And with what wing the staniel checks at it
I may command where I adore . Why , she may command me . I serve her , she is my lady . Why , this is evident to any formal capacity . There is no obstruction in this . And the end what should that alphabetical position portend If I could make that resemble something in me Softly M . O . A . I .
O , ay , make up that . He is now at a cold scent .
Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this , though it be as rank as a fox .
We do not know .
Do not you hear a cry
Here , here For heaven’s sake , help me
What’s the matter
This is Othello’s ancient , as I take it .
The same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
What are you here that cry so grievously
Iago Oh , I am spoiled , undone by villains Give me some help .
Oh , me , lieutenant What villains have done this
I think that one of them is hereabout , And cannot make away .
Oh , treacherous villains What are you there Come in , and give some help .
Oh , help me there
That’s one of them .
I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it . You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note .
O murd rous slave O villain
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject , makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man .
Would they else be content to die
Yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live .
If the king had no son , they would desire to live on crutches till he had one .
Things have fall n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter . Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I . Well , we were born to die . Tis very late . She’ll not come down tonight . I promise you , but for your company , I would have been abed an hour ago .
These times of woe afford no time to woo . Madam , good night . Commend me to your daughter .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow . Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child’s love . I think she will be ruled In all respects by me . Nay , more , I doubt it not . Wife , go you to her ere you go to bed . Acquaint her here of my son Paris love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next But , soft What day is this
Monday , my lord .
Monday Ha , ha . Well , Wednesday is too soon , O Thursday let it be . O Thursday , tell her , She shall be married to this noble earl . Will you be ready Do you like this haste We’ll keep no great ado , a friend or two . For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much . Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end . But what say you to Thursday
Nine changes of the watery star hath been The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne Without a burthen time as long again Would be filled up , my brother , with our thanks And yet we should , for perpetuity , Go hence in debt and therefore , like a cipher , Yet standing in rich place , I multiply With one ‘We thank you’ many thousands more That go before it .
Stay your thanks a while And pay them when you part .
Sir , that’s to morrow . I am question’d by my fears , of what may chance Or breed upon our absence that may blow No sneaping winds at home , to make us say ‘This is put forth too truly ’ besides , I have stay’d To tire your royalty .
We are tougher , brother , Than you can put us to’t .
But tell me , dost thou know my lady Sylvia
No longer stay .
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
One seven night longer .
Hast thou observed that Even she I mean .
Why , sir , I know her not .
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her , and yet know’st her not
Is she not hard favored , sir
Not so fair , boy , as well favored .
Sir , I know that well enough .
What dost thou know
That she is not so fair as , of you , well favored .
I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favor infinite .
That’s because the one is painted and the other out of all count .
How painted And how out of count
Marry , sir , so painted , to make her fair , that no man counts of her beauty .
How esteem’st thou me I account of her beauty .
You never saw her since she was deformed .
How long hath she been deformed
Ever since you loved her .
I have loved her ever since I saw her , and still I see her beautiful .
If you love her , you cannot see her .
Why
Because Love is blind . O , that you had mine eyes , or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered
What should I see then
I pray you , let it stand .
The poorest service is repaid with thanks , And so shall mine , before you touch the meat .
I thank you , sir .
Signior Petruchio , fie , you are to blame . Come , mistress Kate , I’ll bear you company .
Eat it up all , Hortensio , if thou lovest me . Much good do it unto thy gentle heart . Kate , eat apace . And now , my honey love , Will we return unto thy father’s house And revel it as bravely as the best , With silken coats and caps and golden rings , With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things , With scarves and fans and double change of brav ry , With amber bracelets , beads , and all this knav ry . What , hast thou dined The tailor stays thy leisure To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure .
But one fiend at a time , I’ll fight their legions o er .
I’ll be thy second .
Come , tailor , let us see these ornaments . Lay forth the gown .
What news with you , sir
All three of them are desperate . Their great guilt , Like poison given to work a great time after , Now gins to bite the spirits . I do beseech you That are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to .
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak .
Follow , I pray you .
Flatter my sorrow with report of it . Tell me what state , what dignity , what honor , Canst thou demise to any child of mine
O damned Iago O inhuman dog
Even all I have ay , and myself and all Will I withal endow a child of thine So in the Lethe of thy angry soul Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs Which thou supposest I have done to thee .
Kill men i th dark Where be these bloody thieves How silent is this town Ho murder murder What may you be Are you of good or evil
Be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness date .
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .
As you shall prove us , praise us .
Signior Lodovico
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter .
Well get you gone . O Thursday be it , then . Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed . Prepare her , wife , against this wedding day . Farewell , my lord . Light to my chamber , ho Afore me It is so very late , That we may call it early by and by . Good night .
He , sir .
My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul .
I cry you mercy . Here’s Cassio hurt by villains .
What do you think
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul . So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers , And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it .
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning . I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter And do intend to make her Queen of England .
Well then , who dost thou mean shall be her king
Even he that makes her queen . Who else should be
What , thou
Even so . How think you of it
Cassio
How is ’t , brother
My leg is cut in two .
Marry , heaven forbid Light , gentlemen , I’ll bind it with my shirt .
What is the matter , ho Who is ’t that cried
Who is ’t that cried
Oh , my dear Cassio My sweet Cassio O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio
O notable strumpet Cassio , may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you
M Malvolio . M why , that begins my name .
Did not I say he would work it out The cur is excellent at faults .
M . But then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation A should follow but O does .
And O shall end , I hope .
Ay , or I’ll cudgel him and make him cry O
And then I comes behind .
Ay , an you had any eye behind you , you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you .
M . O . A . I . This simulation is not as the former , and yet to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name . Soft , here follows prose .
If this fall into thy hand , revolve . In my stars I am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness . Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon em . Thy Fates open their hands . Let thy blood and spirit embrace them . And , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh . Be opposite with a kinsman , surly with servants .
Your own present folly and her passing deformity for he , being in love , could not see to garter his hose , and you , being in love , cannot see to put on your hose .
Why , this was molded on a porringer A velvet dish Fie , fie , ’tis lewd and filthy Why , ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell , A knack , a toy , a trick , a baby’s cap . Away with it Come , let me have a bigger .
Belike , boy , then you are in love , for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes .
I’ll have no bigger . This doth fit the time , And gentlewomen wear such caps as these .
When you are gentle , you shall have one too , And not till then .
True , sir . I was in love with my bed . I thank you , you swinged me for my love , which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours .
In conclusion , I stand affected to her .
That will not be in haste .
I would you were set so your affection would cease .
Why , sir , I trust I may have leave to speak , And speak I will . I am no child , no babe . Your betters have endured me say my mind , And if you cannot , best you stop your ears . My tongue will tell the anger of my heart Or else my heart , concealing it , will break , And , rather than it shall , I will be free Even to the uttermost , as I please , in words .
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves .
Why , thou say’st true . It is a paltry cap , A custard coffin , a bauble , a silken pie . I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not .
And have you
Love me or love me not , I like the cap , And it I will have , or I will have none .
I have .
Are they not lamely writ
Thy gown Why , ay . Come , tailor , let us see ’t . O mercy , God What masking stuff is here What’s this A sleeve Tis like a demi cannon .
No , boy , but as well as I can do them . Peace , here she comes .
O , excellent motion O , exceeding puppet Now will he interpret to her .
Madam and mistress , a thousand good morrows .
O , give ye good even Here’s a million of manners .
Sir Valentine and servant , to you two thousand .
He should give her interest , and she gives it him .
As you enjoined me , I have writ your letter Unto the secret , nameless friend of yours , Which I was much unwilling to proceed in But for my duty to your ladyship .
I thank you , gentle servant . ’Tis very clerkly done .
Now trust me , madam , it came hardly off For , being ignorant to whom it goes , I writ at random , very doubtfully .
What , up and down , carved like an apple tart Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash , Like to a censer in a barber’s shop . Why , what i devil’s name , tailor , call’st thou this
I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown .
You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time .
Marry , and did . But if you be remembered , I did not bid you mar it to the time . Go , hop me over every kennel home , For you shall hop without my custom , sir . I’ll none of it . Hence , make your best of it .
I never saw a better fashioned gown , More quaint , more pleasing , nor more commendable . Belike you mean to make a puppet of me .
Perchance you think too much of so much pains
No , madam . So it stead you , I will write Please you command a thousand times as much . And yet
A pretty period Well , I guess the sequel And yet I will not name it and yet I care not And yet take this again and yet I thank you , Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more .
Why , true , he means to make a puppet of thee .
And yet you will , and yet another yet .
What means your ladyship Do you not like it
Yes , yes . The lines are very quaintly writ , But , since unwillingly , take them again . Nay , take them .
She says your Worship means to make a puppet of her .
Madam , they are for you .
O monstrous arrogance Thou liest , thou thread , thou thimble , Thou yard , three quarters , half yard , quarter , nail Thou flea , thou nit , thou winter cricket thou Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread Away , thou rag , thou quantity , thou remnant , Or I shall so be mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st I tell thee , I , that thou hast marred her gown .
Ay , ay . You writ them , sir , at my request , But I will none of them . They are for you . I would have had them writ more movingly .
Please you , I’ll write your ladyship another .
And when it’s writ , for my sake read it over . And if it please you , so if not , why , so .
If it please me , madam , what then
No .
I am sorry to find you thus . I have been to seek you .
Lend me a garter . So . Oh , for a chair , To bear him easily hence
Alas , he faints O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio
Gentlemen all , I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury . Patience awhile , good Cassio . Come , come , Lend me a light . Know we this face or no Alas , my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo No yes , sure Yes , ’tis Roderigo .
What , of Venice
Even he , sir . Did you know him
Know him Ay .
Signior Gratiano I cry you gentle pardon , These bloody accidents must excuse my manners That so neglected you .
I am glad to see you .
How do you , Cassio Oh , a chair , a chair
Roderigo
He , he , ’tis he .
If I have too austerely punished you , Your compensation makes amends , for I Have given you here a third of mine own life Or that for which I live who once again I tender to thy hand . All thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love and thou Hast strangely stood the test . Here , afore heaven , I ratify this my rich gift . O Ferdinand , Do not smile at me that I boast of her , For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her .
I do believe it Against an oracle .
Then as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased , take my daughter . But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered , No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow , but barren hate , Sour eyed disdain , and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both . Therefore take heed , As Hymen’s lamps shall light you .
Let thy tongue tang arguments of state . Put thyself into the trick of singularity . She thus advises thee that sighs for thee . Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross gartered . I say , remember . Go to , thou art made , if thou desir’st to be so if not , let me see thee a steward still , the fellow of servants , and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers . Farewell . She that would alter services with thee , The Fortunate Unhappy
Daylight and champaign discovers not more . This is open . I will be proud , I will read politic authors , I will baffle Sir Toby , I will wash off gross acquaintance , I will be point devise the very man . I do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me . She did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being cross gartered , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction , drives me to these habits of her liking . I thank my stars I am happy . I will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and cross gartered , even with the swiftness of putting on . Jove and my stars be praised Here is yet a postscript .
Thou canst not choose but know who I am . If thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling . Thy smiles become thee well . Therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , I prithee .
Very sooth , to morrow .
We’ll part the time between’s then and in that I’ll no gainsaying .
Press me not , beseech you , so . There is no tongue that moves , none , none i’ the world , So soon as yours could win me so it should now , Were there necessity in your request , although ’Twere needful I denied it . My affairs Do even drag me homeward which to hinder Were in your love a whip to me my stay To you a charge and trouble to save both , Farewell , our brother .
Tongue tied , our queen speak you .
I had thought , sir , to have held my peace until You have drawn oaths from him not to stay . You , sir , Charge him too coldly . Tell him , you are sure All in Bohemia’s well this satisfaction The by gone day proclaim’d say this to him , He’s beat from his best ward .
Well said , Hermione .
To tell , he longs to see his son , were strong But let him say so then , and let him go But let him swear so , and he shall not stay , We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs . Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure The borrow of a week . When at Bohemia You take my lord , I’ll give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefix’d for’s parting yet , good deed , Leontes , I love thee not a jar o’ the clock behind What lady she her lord . You’ll stay
Wilt thou be gone It is not yet near day . It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . Believe me , love , it was the nightingale .
It was the lark , the herald of the morn , No nightingale . Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east . Night’s candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . I must be gone and live , or stay and die .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I . It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua . Therefore stay yet . Thou need’st not to be gone .
Let me be ta en . Let me be put to death . I am content , so thou wilt have it so . I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye . Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow . Nor that is not the lark , whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads . I have more care to stay than will to go . Come , death , and welcome Juliet wills it so . How is ’t , my soul Let’s talk . It is not day .
How canst thou woo her
That would I learn of you , As one being best acquainted with her humor .
And wilt thou learn of me
Madam , with all my heart .
Send to her , by the man that slew her brothers , A pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave Edward and York . Then haply she will weep . Therefore present to her as sometime Margaret Did to thy father , steeped in Rutland’s blood A handkerchief , which say to her did drain The purple sap from her sweet brother’s body , And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal . If this inducement move her not to love , Send her a letter of thy noble deeds Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence , Her uncle Rivers , ay , and for her sake Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne .
You mock me , madam . This is not the way To win your daughter .
There is no other way , Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard , that hath done all this .
Say that I did all this for love of her .
Nay , then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee , Having bought love with such a bloody spoil .
Your Worship is deceived . The gown is made Just as my master had direction . Grumio gave order how it should be done .
I gave him no order . I gave him the stuff .
But how did you desire it should be made
Marry , sir , with needle and thread .
But did you not request to have it cut
Thou hast faced many things .
I have .
Face not me . Thou hast braved many men brave not me . I will neither be faced nor braved . I say unto thee , I bid thy master cutout the gown , but I did not bid him cut it to pieces . Ergo , thou liest .
Why , here is the note of the fashion to testify .
Read it .
The note lies in ’s throat , if he say I said so .
Imprimis , a loose bodied gown
Jove , I thank thee I will smile . I will do everything that thou wilt have me .
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy .
I could marry this wench for this device .
So could I too .
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
Nor I neither .
Here comes my noble gull catcher .
Wilt thou set thy foot o my neck
Or o mine either
Shall I play my freedom at tray trip , and become thy bondslave
I faith , or I either
Why , thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
Why , if it please you , take it for your labor . And so good morrow , servant .
O jest unseen , inscrutable , invisible As a nose on a man’s face or a weathercock on a steeple My master sues to her , and she hath taught her suitor , He being her pupil , to become her tutor . O excellent device Was there ever heard a better , That my master , being scribe , to himself should write the letter
How now , sir What , are you reasoning with yourself
Nay , I was rhyming . ’Tis you that have the reason .
To do what
To be a spokesman from Madam Sylvia .
To whom
To yourself . Why , she woos you by a figure .
What figure
By a letter , I should say .
Why , she hath not writ to me .
What need she , when she hath made you write to yourself Why , do you not perceive the jest
No , believe me .
No believing you , indeed , sir . But did you perceive her earnest
She gave me none , except an angry word .
Why , she hath given you a letter .
Master , if ever I said loose bodied gown , sew me in the skirts of it , and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread . I said a gown .
Proceed .
With a small compassed cape
I confess the cape .
With a trunk sleeve
I confess two sleeves .
The sleeves curiously cut .
Ay , there’s the villany .
Error i the bill , sir , error i the bill I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again , and that I’ll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble .
This is true that I say an I had thee in place where , thou shouldst know it .
I am for thee straight . Take thou the bill , give me thy mete yard , and spare not me .
God a mercy , Grumio Then he shall have no odds .
Well , sir , in brief , the gown is not for me .
You are i the right , sir , ’tis for my mistress .
Oh , that’s well said the chair Some good man bear him carefully from hence . I’ll fetch the general’s surgeon . For you , mistress , Save you your labor . He that lies slain here , Cassio , Was my dear friend . What malice was between you
None in the world , nor do I know the man .
What , look you pale Oh , bear him out o the air .
Nay , but say true , does it work upon him
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye Stay you , good gentlemen . Look you pale , mistress Nay , if you stare , we shall hear more anon . Behold her well . I pray you , look upon her . Do you see , gentlemen Nay , guiltiness Will speak , though tongues were out of use .
Like aqua vitae with a midwife .
If you will then see the fruits of the sport , mark his first approach before my lady . He will come to her in yellow stockings , and ’tis a color she abhors , and cross gartered , a fashion she detests . And he will smile upon her , which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition , being addicted to a melancholy as she is , that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt . If you will see it , follow me .
Alas , what is the matter What is the matter , husband
To the gates of Tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are ’scaped . He’s almost slain , and Roderigo dead .
I’ll make one too .
Alas , good gentleman Alas , good Cassio
This is the fruits of whoring . Prithee , Emilia , Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight . What , do you shake at that
Look what is done cannot be now amended . Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , Which after hours give leisure to repent . If I did take the kingdom from your sons , To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter . If I have killed the issue of your womb , To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter . A grandam’s name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother . They are as children but one step below , Even of your metal , of your very blood , Of all one pain , save for a night of groans Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow . Your children were vexation to your youth , But mine shall be a comfort to your age . The loss you have is but a son being king , And by that loss your daughter is made queen . I cannot make you what amends I would Therefore accept such kindness as I can . Dorset your son , that with a fearful soul Leads discontented steps in foreign soil , This fair alliance quickly shall call home To high promotions and great dignity . The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother . Again shall you be mother to a king , And all the ruins of distressful times Repaired with double riches of content . What , we have many goodly days to see The liquid drops of tears that you have shed Shall come again , transformed to orient pearl , Advantaging their love with interest Of ten times double gain of happiness . Go then , my mother to thy daughter go .
It is , it is . Hie hence Be gone , away It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps . Some say the lark makes sweet division . This doth not so , for she divideth us . Some say the lark and loathèd toad change eyes . Oh , now I would they had changed voices too , Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray , Hunting thee hence with hunt’s up to the day . O , now be gone . More light and light it grows .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes
Madam .
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber . The day is broke . Be wary , look about .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .
Farewell , farewell . One kiss , and I’ll descend .
As I hope For quiet days , fair issue , and long life , With such love as ’tis now , the murkiest den , The most opportune place , the strong’st suggestion , Our worser genius can shall never melt Mine honor into lust to take away The edge of that day’s celebration When I shall think , or Phoebus steeds are foundered , Or night kept chained below .
Fairly spoke . Sit then and talk with her . She is thine own . What , Ariel My industrious servant , Ariel
What would my potent master Here I am .
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform , and I must use you In such another trick . Go bring the rabble , O er whom I give thee power , here to this place . Incite them to quick motion , for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art . It is my promise , And they expect it from me .
Presently
Ay , with a twink .
Before you can say Come and Go , And breathe twice and cry So , so Each one , tripping on his toe ,
No , madam .
Nay , but you will
I may not , verily .
Verily You put me off with limber vows but I , Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths , Should yet say ‘Sir , no going . ’ Verily , You shall not go a lady’s ‘Verily’ ’s As potent as a lord’s . Will you go yet Force me to keep you as a prisoner , Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees When you depart , and save your thanks . How say you My prisoner or my guest by your dread ‘Verily , ’ One of them you shall be .
Your guest , then , madam To be your prisoner should import offending Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish .
Not your gaoler , then , But your kind hostess . Come , I’ll question you Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys You were pretty lordings then
Art thou gone so , love , lord Ay , husband , friend , I must hear from thee every day in the hour , For in a minute there are many days . Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .
Farewell I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
Oh , think’st thou we shall ever meet again
I doubt it not , and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come .
O God , I have an ill divining soul . Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb . Either my eyesight fails , or thou look’st pale .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you . Dry sorrow drinks our blood . Adieu , adieu
O fortune , fortune All men call thee fickle . If thou art fickle , what dost thou with him That is renowned for faith Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .
Ho , daughter , are you up
Go , take it up unto thy master’s use .
Villain , not for thy life Take up my mistress gown for thy master’s use
Why , sir , what’s your conceit in that
O , sir , the conceit is deeper than you think for . Take up my mistress gown to his master’s use O , fie , fie , fie
Go , take it hence . Begone , and say no more .
Tailor , I’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow . Take no unkindness of his hasty words . Away , I say . Commend me to thy master .
Well , come , my Kate . We will unto your father’s Even in these honest mean habiliments . Our purses shall be proud , our garments poor , For ’tis the mind that makes the body rich , And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds , So honor peereth in the meanest habit . What , is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye
That’s the letter I writ to her friend .
Make bold her bashful years with your experience Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale Put in her tender heart th aspiring flame Of golden sovereignty acquaint the Princess With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys And when this arm of mine hath chastisèd The petty rebel , dull brained Buckingham , Bound with triumphant garlands will I come And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed , To whom I will retail my conquest won , And she shall be sole victoress , Caesar’s Caesar .
And that letter hath she delivered , and there an end .
What were I best to say Her father’s brother Would be her lord Or shall I say her uncle Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles Under what title shall I woo for thee , That God , the law , my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years
Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance .
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war .
Tell her the king , that may command , entreats
That , at her hands , which the king’s King forbids .
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen .
To vail the title , as her mother doth .
Say I will love her everlastingly .
Save thee , friend , and thy music . Dost thou live by thy tabour
No , sir , I live by the church .
Art thou a churchman
No such matter , sir . I do live by the church for I do live at my house , and my house doth stand by the church .
I would it were no worse .
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him , or the church stands by thy tabor , if thy tabor stand by the church .
I’ll warrant you , ’tis as well . For often have you writ to her , and she , in modesty , Or else for want of idle time , could not again reply Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover , Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover . All this I speak in print , for in print I found it . Why muse you , sir ’Tis dinner time .
You have said , sir . To see this age A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit . How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward
I have dined .
Nay , that’s certain . They that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton .
Ay , but hearken , sir though the chameleon Love can feed on the air , I am one that am nourished by my victuals , and would fain have meat . O , be not like your mistress be moved , be moved
I would therefore my sister had no name , sir .
Why , man
He supped at my house , but I therefore shake not .
Oh , did he so I charge you , go with me .
Oh , fie upon thee , strumpet
I am no strumpet , but of life as honest As you that thus abuse me .
As I Fie upon thee
Kind gentlemen , let’s go see poor Cassio dressed . Come , mistress , you must tell ’s another tale . Emilia , run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed . Will you go on afore This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite .
Who is ’t that calls Is it my lady mother Is she not down so late or up so early What unaccustomed cause procures her hither
Why , how now , Juliet
Madam , I am not well .
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live . Therefore , have done . Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
Will be here with mop and mow . Do you love me , master , no
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
Feeling so the loss , Cannot choose but ever weep the friend .
Well , girl , thou weep’st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
What villain , madam
Dearly my delicate Ariel . Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call .
That same villain , Romeo .
Well , I conceive .
Look thou be true . Do not give dalliance Too much the rein . The strongest oaths are straw To th fire i th blood . Be more abstemious , Or else , goodnight your vow .
I warrant you , sir , The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver .
Well . Now come , my Ariel Bring a corollary , Rather than want a spirit . Appear and pertly
Have patience , gentle Julia .
No tongue . All eyes Be silent .
I must , where is no remedy .
When possibly I can , I will return .
Ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas Of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats , and peas Thy turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , And flat meads thatched with stover , them to keep Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims ,
If you turn not , you will return the sooner . Keep this remembrance for thy Julia’s sake .
Why , then , we’ll make exchange here , take you this .
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss .
Here is my hand for my true constancy And when that hour o’erslips me in the day Wherein I sigh not , Julia , for thy sake , The next ensuing hour some foul mischance Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness My father stays my coming . Answer not . The tide is now nay , not thy tide of tears That tide will stay me longer than I should . Julia , farewell
What , gone without a word Ay , so true love should do it cannot speak , For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it .
We were , fair queen , Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day to morrow as to day , And to be boy eternal .
Was not my lord The verier wag o’ the two
We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ the sun , And bleat the one at the other what we changed Was innocence for innocence we knew not The doctrine of ill doing , nor dream’d That any did . Had we pursued that life , And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d With stronger blood , we should have answer’d heaven Boldly ‘not guilty ’ the imposition clear’d Hereditary ours .
By this we gather You have tripp’d since .
O my most sacred lady Temptations have since then been born to’s for In those unfledged days was my wife a girl Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes Of my young play fellow .
Grace to boot Of this make no conclusion , lest you say Your queen and I are devils yet go on The offences we have made you do we’ll answer , If you first sinn’d with us and that with us You did continue fault and that you slipp’d not With any but with us .
Oh , no , good Kate . Neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array . If thou account’st it shame , lay it on me , And therefore frolic We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father’s house . Go , call my men , and let us straight to him , And bring our horses unto Long Lane end . There will we mount , and thither walk on foot . Let’s see , I think ’tis now some seven o clock , And well we may come there by dinnertime .
I dare assure you , sir , ’tis almost two , And ’twill be supper time ere you come there .
It shall be seven ere I go to horse . Look what I speak , or do , or think to do , You are still crossing it . Sirs , let ’t alone . I will not go today , and ere I do It shall be what o clock I say it is .
Why , so this gallant will command the sun .
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims To make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves , Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves , Being lass lorn thy pole clipped vineyard And thy sea marge , sterile and rocky hard , Where thou thyself dost air the Queen o th Sky , Whose watery arch and messenger am I , Bids thee leave these , and with her sovereign grace ,
Here on this grass plot , in this very place , To come and sport . Her peacocks fly amain . Approach , rich Ceres , her to entertain .
Hail , many colored messenger , that ne er Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey drops , refreshing showers And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down , Rich scarf to my proud earth . Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short grassed green
A contract of true love to celebrate , And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers .
Tell me , heavenly bow , If Venus or her son , as thou dost know , Do now attend the queen Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got , Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company I have forsworn .
Sir Proteus , you are stayed for .
Go . I come , I come . Alas This parting strikes poor lovers dumb .
But how long shall that title ever last
Sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end .
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last
God pardon him I do , with all my heart , And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart .
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
As long as hell and Richard likes of it .
Say I , her sovereign , am her subject low .
But she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
Be eloquent in my behalf to her .
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale .
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
O no , my reasons are too deep and dead Too deep and dead , poor infants , in their graves .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands . Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death
We will have vengeance for it , fear thou not . Then weep no more . I’ll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company . And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him dead Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed . Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet . Oh , how my heart abhors To hear him named , and cannot come to him . To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him
Find thou the means , and I’ll find such a man . But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
And joy comes well in such a needy time . What are they , beseech your ladyship
It is the cause , it is the cause , my soul . Let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , It is the cause . Yet I’ll not shed her blood , Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster . Yet she must die , else she’ll betray more men . Put out the light , and then put out the light . If I quench thee , thou flaming minister , I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me . But once put out thy light , Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature , I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume . When I have plucked thy rose I cannot give it vital growth again , It must needs wither . I’ll smell thee on the tree . Oh , balmy breath , that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword One more , one more . Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee And love thee after . One more , and that’s the last . So sweet was ne er so fatal . I must weep , But they are cruel tears . This sorrow’s heavenly , It strikes where it doth love . She wakes .
Who’s there Othello
Ay , Desdemona .
Why , sir , her name’s a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton . But , indeed , words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them .
Thy reason , man
Troth , sir , I can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , I am loath to prove reason with them .
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
Harp not on that string , madam that is past .
Harp on it still shall I till heart strings break .
Now by my George , my Garter , and my crown
Profaned , dishonored , and the third usurped .
Not so , sir , I do care for something . But in my conscience , sir , I do not care for you . If that be to care for nothing , sir , I would it would make you invisible .
Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool
No , indeed , sir the Lady Olivia has no folly . She will keep no fool , sir , till she be married , and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings the husband’s the bigger I am indeed not her fool , but her corrupter of words .
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s .
Of her society Be not afraid . I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos , and her son Dove drawn with her . Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid , Whose vows are that no bed right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted but in vain . Mars’s hot minion is returned again . Her waspish headed son has broke his arrows , Swears he will shoot no more , but play with sparrows And be a boy right out .
Highest queen of state , Great Juno , comes . I know her by her gait .
How does my bounteous sister Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be , And honored in their issue .
Honor , riches , marriage , blessing , Long continuance , and increasing , Hourly joys be still upon you . Juno sings her blessings on you .
Sir , this is the house . Please it you that I call
Ay , what else and but I be deceived , Signior Baptista may remember me , Near twenty years ago , in Genoa , Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus .
Tis well and hold your own , in any case , With such austerity as longeth to a father .
I warrant you .
But , sir , here comes your boy . Twere good he were schooled .
Fear you not him . Sirrah Biondello , Now do your duty throughly , I advise you . Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio .
Tut , fear not me .
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista
I told him that your father was at Venice , And that you looked for him this day in Padua .
Is he won yet
He’ll stay my lord .
At my request he would not . Hermione , my dearest , thou never spokest To better purpose .
Never
Never , but once .
What have I twice said well when was’t before I prithee tell me cram’s with praise , and make’s As fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that . Our praises are our wages you may ride’s With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we beat an acre . But to the goal My last good deed was to entreat his stay What was my first it has an elder sister , Or I mistake you O , would her name were Grace But once before I spoke to the purpose when Nay , let me have’t I long .
Why , that was when Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death , Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love then didst thou utter ‘I am yours for ever . ’
Foolery , sir , does walk about the orb like the sun . It shines everywhere . I would be sorry , sir , but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress I think I saw your wisdom there .
Nay , an thou pass upon me , I’ll no more with thee . Hold , there’s expenses for thee .
Now Jove , in his next commodity of hair , send thee a beard
By my troth , I’ll tell thee , I am almost sick for one , Is thy lady within
Would not a pair of these have bred , sir
Yes , being kept together and put to use .
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia , sir , to bring a Cressida to this Troilus .
I understand you , sir . Tis well begged .
The matter , I hope , is not great , sir , begging but a beggar . Cressida was a beggar . My lady is within , sir . I will construe to them whence you come . Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , I might say element , but the word is overworn .
Thou rt a tall fellow . Hold thee that to drink . Gives money
Here comes Baptista . Set your countenance , sir .
Signior Baptista , you are happily met . Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of . I pray you stand good father to me now . Give me Bianca for my patrimony .
Soft son . Sir , by your leave , having come to Padua To gather in some debts , my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself . And , for the good report I hear of you And for the love he beareth to your daughter And she to him , to stay him not too long , I am content , in a good father’s care , To have him matched . And if you please to like No worse than I , upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestowed , For curious I cannot be with you , Signior Baptista , of whom I hear so well .
Sir , pardon me in what I have to say . Your plainness and your shortness please me well . Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections . And therefore , if you say no more than this , That like a father you will deal with him And pass my daughter a sufficient dower , The match is made , and all is done . Your son shall have my daughter with consent .
Earth’s increase , foison plenty , Barns and garners never empty , Vines and clustering bunches growing , Plants with goodly burden bowing Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest . Scarcity and want shall shun you . Ceres blessing so is on you .
This is a most majestic vision , and Harmonious charmingly . May I be bold To think these spirits
Spirits , which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies .
Let me live here ever . So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise .
Sweet now , silence . Juno and Ceres whisper seriously . There’s something else to do . Hush and be mute , Or else our spell is marred .
You nymphs , called naiads of the windring brooks , With your sedged crowns and ever harmless looks , Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons , Juno does command .
’Tis grace indeed . Why , lo you now , I have spoke to the purpose twice The one for ever earn’d a royal husband The other for some while a friend .
Too hot , too hot To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods . I have tremor cordis on me my heart dances But not for joy not joy . This entertainment May a free face put on , derive a liberty From heartiness , from bounty , fertile bosom , And well become the agent ’t may , I grant But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers , As now they are , and making practised smiles , As in a looking glass , and then to sigh , as ’twere The mort o’ the deer O , that is entertainment My bosom likes not , nor my brows Mamillius , Art thou my boy
Ay , my good lord .
I’ fecks Why , that’s my bawcock . What , hast smutch’d thy nose They say it is a copy out of mine . Come , captain , We must be neat not neat , but cleanly , captain And yet the steer , the heifer and the calf Are all call’d neat . Still virginalling Upon his palm How now , you wanton calf Art thou my calf
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool , And to do that well craves a kind of wit . He must observe their mood on whom he jests , The quality of persons , and the time , And , like the haggard , check at every feather That comes before his eye . This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man’s art , For folly that he wisely shows is fit . But wise men , folly fall n , quite taint their wit .
Save you , gentleman .
And you , sir .
Dieu vous garde , monsieur .
Et vous aussi . Votre serviteur
I hope , sir , you are , and I am yours .
Will you encounter the house My niece is desirous you should enter , if your trade be to her .
I am bound to your niece , sir . I mean , she is the list of my voyage .
Taste your legs , sir . Put them to motion .
I thank you , sir . Where then do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta en As shall with either part’s agreement stand
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child . One who , to put thee from thy heaviness , Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expect’st not , nor I looked not for .
Not in my house , Lucentio , for you know Pitchers have ears , and I have many servants . Besides , old Gremio is heark ning still , And happily we might be interrupted .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter’s Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
Then at my lodging , an it like you . There doth my father lie , and there this night We’ll pass the business privately and well . Send for your daughter by your servant here . My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently . The worst is this , that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance .
Now , by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride . I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo . I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet . And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris . These are news indeed
It likes me well . Cambio , hie you home , And bid Bianca make her ready straight . And , if you will , tell what hath happenèd Lucentio’s father is arrived in Padua , And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife .
Here comes your father . Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
I pray the gods she may , with all my heart
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew , But for the sunset of my brother’s son It rains downright . How now A conduit , girl What , still in tears , Evermore showering In one little body Thou counterfeit’st a bark , a sea , a wind , For still thy eyes , which I may call the sea , Do ebb and flow with tears . The bark thy body is , Sailing in this salt flood . The winds thy sighs , Who , raging with thy tears , and they with them , Without a sudden calm will overset Thy tempest tossèd body . How now , wife Have you delivered to her our decree
Nay , ’twill be this hour ere I have done weeping . All the kind of the Lances have this very fault . I have received my proportion , like the prodigious son , and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial’s court . I think Crab , my dog , be the sourest natured dog that lives . My mother weeping , my father wailing , my sister crying , our maid howling , our cat wringing her hands , and all our house in a great perplexity , yet did not this cruel hearted cur shed one tear . He is a stone , a very pebblestone , and has no more pity in him than a dog . A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting . Why , my grandam , having no eyes , look you , wept herself blind at my parting . Nay , I’ll show you the manner of it . This shoe is my father . No , this left shoe is my father . No , no , this left shoe is my mother . Nay , that cannot be so neither . Yes , it is so , it is so–it hath the worser sole . This shoe , with the hole in it , is my mother , and this my father . A vengeance on ’t There ’tis . Now , sir , this staff is my sister , for , look you , she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand . This hat is Nan , our maid . I am the dog . No , the dog is himself , and I am the dog O , the dog is me , and I am myself . Ay , so , so . Now come I to my father Father , your blessing . Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping . Now should I kiss my father . Well , he weeps on . Now come I to my mother . O , that she could speak now like a moved woman Well , I kiss her . Why there ’tis . Here’s my mother’s breath up and down . Now come I to my sister mark the moan she makes . Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word but see how I lay the dust with my tears .
Lance , away , away , aboard Thy master is shipped , and thou art to post after with oars . What’s the matter Why weep’st thou , man Away , ass You’ll lose the tide if you tarry any longer .
It is no matter if the tied were lost for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied .
What’s the unkindest tide
Why , he that’s tied here , Crab , my dog .
Tut , man , I mean thou’lt lose the flood , and in losing the flood , lose thy voyage , and in losing thy voyage , lose thy master , and , in losing thy master , lose thy service , and , in losing thy service
Why dost thou stop my mouth
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue .
Where should I lose my tongue
Come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate A contract of true love . Be not too late .
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary , Come hither from the furrow and be merry . Make holiday . Your rye straw hats put on , And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing .
I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life . The minute of their plot Is almost come . Well done . Avoid , no more
This is strange . Your father’s in some passion That works him strongly .
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered .
You do look , my son , in a moved sort , As if you were dismayed . Be cheerful , sir . Our revels now are ended . These our actors , As I foretold you , were all spirits and Are melted into air , into thin air .
In thy tale .
In thy tail
Lose the tide , and the voyage , and the master , and the service , and the tied Why , man , if the river were dry , I am able to fill it with my tears if the wind were down , I could drive the boat with my sighs .
Come , come away , man . I was sent to call thee .
Sir , call me what thou dar’st .
Will thou go
Well , I will go .
Yes , if you will , my lord .
Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have , To be full like me yet they say we are Almost as like as eggs women say so , That will say anything but were they false As o’er dyed blacks , as wind , as waters , false As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes No bourn ’twixt his and mine , yet were it true To say this boy were like me . Come , sir page , Look on me with your welkin eye sweet villain Most dear’st my collop Can thy dam may’t be Affection thy intention stabs the centre Thou dost make possible things not so held , Communicatest with dreams how can this be With what’s unreal thou coactive art , And fellow’st nothing then ’tis very credent Thou mayst co join with something and thou dost , And that beyond commission , and I find it , And that to the infection of my brains And hardening of my brows .
What means Sicilia
He something seems unsettled .
How , my lord
My legs do better understand me , sir , than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs .
I mean , to go , sir , to enter .
I will answer you with gait and entrance . But we are prevented .
Most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odors on you
That youth’s a rare courtier . Rain odors . Well .
My matter hath no voice , lady , but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
Odors , pregnant , and vouchsafed . I’ll get em all three all ready .
Let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
Give me your hand , sir .
My duty , madam , and most humble service .
What is your name
Will you come to bed , my lord
Have you prayed tonight , Desdemon
Ay , my lord .
If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace , Solicit for it straight .
Alack , my lord , what do you mean by that
Well , do it , and be brief . I will walk by . I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit . No , heavens forfend , I would not kill thy soul
Talk you of killing
Ay , I do .
Then heaven Have mercy on me
Amen , with all my heart .
If you say , I hope you will not kill me .
Humh
And yet I fear you , for you’re fatal then When your eyes roll so . Why I should fear I know not , Since guiltiness I know not . But yet I feel I fear .
Dally not with the gods , but get thee gone . Signior Baptista , shall I lead the way Welcome One mess is like to be your cheer . Come , sir , we will better it in Pisa .
Think on thy sins .
I follow you .
Cambio .
What sayest thou , Biondello
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you
Biondello , what of that
Faith , nothing but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens .
Ay , sir , but she will none , she gives you thanks . I would the fool were married to her grave
Soft , take me with you , take me with you , wife . How , will she none Doth she not give us thanks Is she not proud Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have . Proud can I never be of what I hate , But thankful even for hate that is meant love .
How , how , how , how Chopped logic What is this Proud , and I thank you , and I thank you not , And yet not proud Mistress minion you , Thank me no thankings , nor proud me no prouds , But fettle your fine joints gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church , Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither . Out , you green sickness , carrion Out , you baggage You tallow face
Fie , fie What , are you mad
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .
I swear
By nothing , for this is no oath . Thy George , profaned , hath lost his lordly honor Thy garter , blemished , pawned his knightly virtue Thy crown , usurped , disgraced his kingly glory . If something thou wouldst swear to be believed , Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged .
Then , by myself
I pray thee , moralize them .
Thyself is self misused .
Now , by the world
Tis full of thy foul wrongs .
Then thus Baptista is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son .
My father’s death
Thy life hath it dishonored .
Why then , by God .
God’s wrong is most of all . If thou didst fear to break an oath by Him , The unity the king my husband made Thou hadst not broken , nor my brothers died . If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him , Th imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child , And both the princes had been breathing here , Which now , two tender bedfellows for dust , Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms . What canst thou swear by now
And what of him
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .
And then
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours .
And what of all this
Cesario is your servant’s name , fair princess .
My servant , sir Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment . You’re servant to the Count Orsino , youth .
And he is yours , and his must needs be yours Your servant’s servant is your servant , madam .
For him , I think not on him . For his thoughts , Would they were blanks , rather than fill’d with me .
Madam , I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf .
O , by your leave , I pray you , I bade you never speak again of him . But , would you undertake another suit , I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres .
Dear lady
Give me leave , beseech you . I did send , After the last enchantment you did here , A ring in chase of you . So did I abuse Myself , my servant , and , I fear me , you Under your hard construction must I sit , To force that on you , in a shameful cunning Which you knew none of yours . What might you think
And like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud capped towers , the gorgeous palaces , The solemn temples , the great globe itself Yea , all which it inherit shall dissolve , And like this insubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a rack behind . We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep . Sir , I am vexed . Bear with my weakness . My old brain is troubled . Be not disturbed with my infirmity . If you be pleased , retire into my cell And there repose . A turn or two I’ll walk To still my beating mind .
We wish your peace .
Come with a thought . I thank thee , Ariel . Come .
Thy thoughts I cleave to . What’s thy pleasure
Spirit , We must prepare to meet with Caliban .
Ay , my commander . When I presented Ceres , I thought to have told thee of it , but I feared Lest I might anger thee .
Say again , where didst thou leave these varlets
Hang thee , young baggage Disobedient wretch I tell thee what get thee to church o Thursday , Or never after look me in the face . Speak not . Reply not . Do not answer me . My fingers itch . Wife , we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child , But now I see this one is one too much And that we have a curse in having her . Out on her , hilding
God in heaven bless her You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
And why , my Lady Wisdom Hold your tongue , Good prudence . Smatter with your gossips , go .
I speak no treason .
Oh , God i good e en .
May not one speak
Peace , you mumbling fool Utter your gravity o er a gossip’s bowl , For here we need it not .
You are too hot .
God’s bread It makes me mad . Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her matched . And having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage , Of fair demesnes , youthful , and nobly trained , Stuffed , as they say , with honorable parts , Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man And then to have a wretched puling fool , A whining mammet , in her fortune’s tender , To answer I’ll not wed , I cannot love , I am too young , I pray you , pardon me . But , an you will not wed , I’ll pardon you . Graze where you will , you shall not house with me . Look to ’t , think on ’t , I do not use to jest . Thursday is near . Lay hand on heart , advise . An you be mine , I’ll give you to my friend . An you be not , hang , beg , starve , die in the streets , For , by my soul , I’ll ne er acknowledge thee , Nor what is mine shall never do thee good . Trust to ’t , bethink you . I’ll not be forsworn .
The time to come .
That thou hast wrongèd in the time o erpast For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time , for time past wronged by thee . The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered , Ungoverned youth , to wail it in their age The parents live whose children thou hast butchered , Old barren plants , to wail it with their age . Swear not by time to come , for that thou hast Misused ere used , by times ill used o erpast .
As I intend to prosper and repent , So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms Myself myself confound , Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours , Day , yield me not thy light , nor night thy rest , Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if , with dear heart’s love , Immaculate devotion , holy thoughts , I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter . In her consists my happiness and thine . Without her follows to myself and thee , Herself , the land , and many a Christian soul , Death , desolation , ruin and decay . It cannot be avoided but by this It will not be avoided but by this . Therefore , dear mother I must call you so Be the attorney of my love to her Plead what I will be , not what I have been Not my deserts , but what I will deserve . Urge the necessity and state of times , And be not peevish found in great designs .
They are loves I bear to you .
Ay , and for that thou diest .
That death’s unnatural that kills for loving . Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip Some bloody passion shakes your very frame . These are portents , but yet I hope , I hope They do not point on me .
Peace , and be still .
I will so . What’s the matter
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee , thou gav’st To Cassio .
No , by my life and soul Send for the man and ask him .
Sweet soul , take heed , take heed of perjury . Thou art on thy deathbed .
Ay but not yet to die
Presently . Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin , For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal . Thou art to die .
Oh , heaven have mercy on me
I say amen .
What cheer how is’t with you , best brother
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction Are you moved , my lord
No , in good earnest . How sometimes nature will betray its folly , Its tenderness , and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms Looking on the lines Of my boy’s face , methoughts I did recoil Twenty three years , and saw myself unbreech’d , In my green velvet coat , my dagger muzzled , Lest it should bite its master , and so prove , As ornaments oft do , too dangerous How like , methought , I then was to this kernel , This squash , this gentleman . Mine honest friend , Will you take eggs for money
No , my lord , I’ll fight .
You will why , happy man be’s dole My brother , Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours
If at home , sir , He’s all my exercise , my mirth , my matter , Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy , My parasite , my soldier , statesman , all He makes a July’s day short as December , And with his varying childness cures in me Thoughts that would thick my blood .
Servant
Mistress
Master , Sir Thurio frowns on you .
Ay , boy , it’s for love .
Not of you .
Of my mistress , then .
’Twere good you knocked him .
Servant , you are sad .
Indeed , madam , I seem so .
Seem you that you are not
Haply I do .
So do counterfeits .
So do you .
What seem I that I am not
Wise .
What instance of the contrary
Your folly .
And how quote you my folly
I quote it in your jerkin .
My jerkin is a doublet .
Well , then , I’ll double your folly .
I told you , sir , they were red hot with drinking , So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces , beat the ground For kissing of their feet yet always bending Towards their project . Then I beat my tabor , At which , like unbacked colts , they pricked their ears , Advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses As they smelt music . So I charmed their ears That , calflike , they my lowing followed through Toothed briers , sharp furzes , pricking gorse , and thorns , Which entered their frail shins . At last I left them I th filthy mantled pool beyond your cell , There dancing up to th chins , that the foul lake O erstunk their feet .
This was well done , my bird . Thy shape invisible retain thou still . The trumpery in my house , go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves .
I go , I go .
A devil , a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick , on whom my pains , Humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost . And as with age his body uglier grows , So his mind cankers . I will plague them all , Even to roaring .
Come , hang them on this line .
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus
Ay , if the devil tempt you to do good .
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief O sweet my mother , cast me not away Delay this marriage for a month , a week . Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
Talk not to me , for I’ll not speak a word . Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
O God O Nurse , how shall this be prevented My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven . How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth Comfort me . Counsel me . Alack , alack , that heaven should practice stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself . What sayst thou Hast thou not a word of joy Some comfort , Nurse .
I cannot tell , except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance . Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum . To th church take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses . If this be not that you look for , I have no more to say , But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day .
Hear’st thou , Biondello
I cannot tarry . I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir . And so adieu , sir . My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix .
I may , and will , if she be so contented . She will be pleased . Then wherefore should I doubt Hap what hap may , I’ll roundly go about her . It shall go hard if Cambio go without her .
And have you mercy too I never did Offend you in my life , never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love . I never gave him token .
By heaven , I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand . O perjured woman , thou dost stone my heart , And mak’st me call what I intend to do A murder , which I thought a sacrifice I saw the handkerchief .
He found it then , I never gave it him . Send for him hither , Let him confess a truth .
He hath confessed .
What , my lord
That he hath usèd thee .
How Unlawfully
Ay .
He will not say so .
No , his mouth is stopped . Honest Iago Hath ta en order for ’t .
Oh My fear interprets . What , is he dead
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all .
Have you not set mine honor at the stake , And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think To one of your receiving Enough is shown . A cypress , not a bosom , Hides my heart . So , let me hear you speak .
I pity you .
That’s a degree to love .
No , not a grize . For ’tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies .
Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again . O world , how apt the poor are to be proud If one should be a prey , how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf The clock upbraids me with the waste of time . Be not afraid , good youth , I will not have you . And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest , Your wife is like to reap a proper man . There lies your way , due west .
Then westward ho Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship You’ll nothing , madam , to my lord by me
Stay , I prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
Shall I forget myself to be myself
Ay , if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself .
Yet thou didst kill my children .
But in your daughter’s womb I bury them , Where , in that nest of spicery , they will breed Selves of themselves , to your recomforture .
That you do think you are not what you are .
If I think so , I think the same of you .
Then think you right I am not what I am .
I would you were as I would have you be
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will
And be a happy mother by the deed .
I go . Write to me very shortly , And you shall understand from me her mind .
Bear her my true love’s kiss and so , farewell .
Relenting fool and shallow , changing woman
How now , what news
How
What , angry , Sir Thurio Do you change color
Give him leave , madam he is a kind of chameleon .
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air .
You have said , sir .
Ay , sir , and done too , for this time .
I know it well , sir you always end ere you begin .
A fine volley of words , gentlemen , and quickly shot off .
’Tis indeed , madam , we thank the giver .
Who is that , servant
Yourself , sweet lady , for you gave the fire . Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship’s looks , and spends what he borrows kindly in your company .
Sir , if you spend word for word with me , I shall make your wit bankrupt .
I know it well , sir you have an exchequer of words , and , I think , no other treasure to give your followers , for it appears , by their bare liveries , that they live by your bare words .
No more , gentlemen , no more . Here comes my father .
Now , daughter Sylvia , you are hard beset . Sir Valentine , your father is in good health . What say you to a letter from your friends Of much good news
My lord , I will be thankful To any happy messenger from thence .
Know ye Don Antonio , your countryman
Ay , my good lord , I know the gentleman To be of worth and worthy estimation , And not without desert so well reputed .
Alas , he is betrayed and I undone .
Out , strumpet weep’st thou for him to my face
Oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not
Down , strumpet
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
Nay , if you strive
But half an hour
Being done , there is no pause .
But while I say one prayer
It is too late .
My lord , my lord What , ho My lord , my lord
What noise is this Not dead Not yet quite dead I that am cruel am yet merciful , I would not have thee linger in thy pain . So , so .
What , ho My lord , my lord
Who’s there
O good my lord , I would speak a word with you
So stands this squire Officed with me we two will walk , my lord , And leave you to your graver steps . Hermione , How thou lovest us , show in our brother’s welcome Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap Next to thyself and my young rover , he’s Apparent to my heart .
If you would seek us , We are yours i’ the garden shall’s attend you there
To your own bents dispose you you’ll be found , Be you beneath the sky . Aside I am angling now , Though you perceive me not how I give line . Go to , go to How she holds up the neb , the bill to him And arms her with the boldness of a wife To her allowing husband
Gone already Inch thick , knee deep , o’er head and ears a fork’d one Go , play , boy , play thy mother plays , and I Play too , but so disgraced a part , whose issue Will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour Will be my knell . Go , play , boy , play . There have been , Or I am much deceived , cuckolds ere now And many a man there is , even at this present , Now while I speak this , holds his wife by the arm , That little thinks she has been sluiced in’s absence And his pond fish’d by his next neighbour , by Sir Smile , his neighbour nay , there’s comfort in’t Whiles other men have gates and those gates open’d , As mine , against their will . Should all despair That have revolted wives , the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves . Physic for’t there is none It is a bawdy planet , that will strike Where ’tis predominant and ’tis powerful , think it , From east , west , north and south be it concluded , No barricado for a belly know’t It will let in and out the enemy With bag and baggage many thousand on’s Have the disease , and feel’t not . How now , boy
Most mighty sovereign , on the western coast Rideth a puissant navy . To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow hearted friends , Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back . Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral And there they hull , expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore .
Some light foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk Ratcliffe , thyself , or Catesby . Where is he
Here , my good lord .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
I will , my lord , with all convenient haste .
Ratcliffe , come hither . Post to Salisbury . When thou com’st thither Dull , unmindful villain , Why stay’st thou here and go’st not to the duke
First , mighty liege , tell me your Highness pleasure , What from your Grace I shall deliver to him .
O true , good Catesby . Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury .
I go .
Pray you , tread softly , that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall . We now are near his cell .
Monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the jack with us .
Monster , I do smell all horse piss , at which my nose is in great indignation .
So is mine . Do you hear , monster If I should take a displeasure against you , look you
Thou wert but a lost monster .
Good my lord , give me thy favor still . Be patient , for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance . Therefore speak softly . All’s hushed as midnight yet .
Ay , but to lose our bottles in the pool
There is not only disgrace and dishonor in that , monster , but an infinite loss .
That’s more to me than my wetting . Yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
I will fetch off my bottle , though I be o er ears for my labor .
Hath he not a son
Ay , my good lord , a son that well deserves The honor and regard of such a father .
You know him well
I knew him as myself , for from our infancy We have conversed and spent our hours together . And though myself have been an idle truant , Omitting the sweet benefit of time To clothe mine age with angel like perfection , Yet hath Sir Proteus for that’s his name Made use and fair advantage of his days His years but young , but his experience old His head unmellowed , but his judgment ripe . And , in a word for far behind his worth Comes all the praises that I now bestow He is complete in feature and in mind With all good grace to grace a gentleman .
Beshrew me , sir , but if he make this good , He is as worthy for an empress’ love As meet to be an emperor’s counselor . Well , sir , this gentleman is come to me , With commendation from great potentates , And here he means to spend his time awhile . I think ’tis no unwelcome news to you .
Would it be better , madam , than I am I wish it might , for now I am your fool .
Cesario , by the roses of the spring , By maidhood , honor , truth , and everything , I love thee so , that , maugre all thy pride , Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide . Do not extort thy reasons from this clause , For that I woo , thou therefore hast no cause , But rather reason thus with reason fetter . Love sought is good , but given unsought better .
By innocence I swear , and by my youth I have one heart , one bosom , and one truth , And that no woman has , nor never none Shall mistress be of it , save I alone . And so adieu , good madam . Nevermore Will I my master’s tears to you deplore .
Yet come again , for thou perhaps mayst move That heart , which now abhors , to like his love .
Faith , here it is . Romeo is banishèd , and all the world to nothing That he dares ne er come back to challenge you . Or , if he do , it needs must be by stealth . Then , since the case so stands as now it doth , I think it best you married with the county . Oh , he’s a lovely gentleman . Romeo’s a dishclout to him . An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath . Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first . Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or ’twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .
Speakest thou from thy heart
And from my soul too , else beshrew them both .
Amen
What
Well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much . Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence’s cell To make confession and to be absolved .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .
Come on , i God’s name , once more toward our father’s . Good Lord , how bright and goodly shines the moon
The moon The sun It is not moonlight now .
I say it is the moon that shines so bright .
I know it is the sun that shines so bright .
Now , by my mother’s son , and that’s myself , It shall be moon , or star , or what I list , Or e er I journey to your father’s house . Go on , and fetch our horses back again . Evermore crossed and crossed , nothing but crossed
Say as he says , or we shall never go .
Forward , I pray , since we have come so far , And be it moon , or sun , or what you please . An if you please to call it a rush candle , Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me .
I say it is the moon .
I know it is the moon .
Nay , then you lie . It is the blessèd sun .
What , may it please you , shall I do at Salisbury
Why , what wouldst thou do there before I go
Your Highness told me I should post before .
My mind is changed .
Stanley , what news with you
None good , my liege , to please you with the hearing , Nor none so bad but well may be reported .
Hoyday , a riddle Neither good nor bad . What need’st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way Once more , what news
Richmond is on the seas .
There let him sink , and be the seas on him White livered runagate , what doth he there
I know not , mighty sovereign , but by guess .
Well , as you guess
Stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , He makes for England , here to claim the crown .
I am like you , they say .
Why that’s some comfort . What , Camillo there
Ay , my good lord .
Go play , Mamillius thou’rt an honest man .
Camillo , this great sir will yet stay longer .
You had much ado to make his anchor hold When you cast out , it still came home .
Didst note it
He would not stay at your petitions made His business more material .
Didst perceive it They’re here with me already , whispering , rounding ‘Sicilia is a so forth ’ ’tis far gone , When I shall gust it last . How came’t , Camillo , That he did stay
At the good queen’s entreaty .
At the queen’s be’t ‘good’ should be pertinent But , so it is , it is not . Was this taken By any understanding pate but thine For thy conceit is soaking , will draw in More than the common blocks not noted , is’t , But of the finer natures by some severals Of head piece extraordinary lower messes Perchance are to this business purblind say .
Prithee , my king , be quiet . Seest thou here , This is the mouth o th cell . No noise , and enter . Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever , and I , thy Caliban , For aye thy foot licker .
Give me thy hand . I do begin to have bloody thoughts .
O King Stephano O peer , O worthy Stephano , look what a wardrobe here is for thee
Let it alone , thou fool . It is but trash .
Oh , ho , monster , we know what belongs to a frippery . O King Stephano
Put off that gown , Trinculo . By this hand , I’ll have that gown .
Thy grace shall have it .
The dropsy drown this fool What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage Let’s alone , And do the murder first . If he awake , From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches , Make us strange stuff .
Be you quiet , monster . Mistress line , is not this my jerkin Now is the jerkin under the line . Now , jerkin , you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin .
Should I have wished a thing , it had been he .
Welcome him then according to his worth . Sylvia , I speak to you , and you , Sir Thurio For Valentine , I need not cite him to it . I will send him hither to you presently .
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship Had come along with me but that his mistress Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks .
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them Upon some other pawn for fealty .
Nay , sure , I think she holds them prisoners still .
Nay , then he should be blind , and being blind How could he see his way to seek out you
Why , lady , Love hath twenty pair of eyes .
They say that Love hath not an eye at all .
To see such lovers , Thurio , as yourself . Upon a homely object Love can wink .
Have done , have done . Here comes the gentleman .
Welcome , dear Proteus Mistress , I beseech you , Confirm his welcome with some special favor .
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither , If this be he you oft have wished to hear from .
Yes , ’tis Emilia . By and by . She’s dead . Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death , The noise was high . Ha No more moving Still as the grave . Shall she come in Were ’t good I think she stirs again No . What’s best to do If she come in , she’ll sure speak to my wife My wife my wife what wife I have no wife . Oh , insupportable Oh , heavy hour Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon , and that th affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration .
I do beseech you That I may speak with you , O good my lord
No , faith , I’ll not stay a jot longer .
I had forgot thee Oh , come in , Emilia . Soft , by and by . Let me the curtains draw . Where art thou
Thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
You must needs yield your reason , Sir Andrew .
What’s the matter with thee now
O my good lord , yonder’s foul murders done
Marry , I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me . I saw ’t i the orchard .
What , now
Did she see thee the while , old boy Tell me that .
As plain as I see you now .
But now , my lord .
This was a great argument of love in her toward you .
It is the very error of the moon , She comes more nearer earth than she was wont And makes men mad .
Slight , will you make an ass o me
Cassio , my lord , hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo .
I will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
And they have been grand jurymen since before Noah was a sailor .
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valor , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver . You should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , fire new from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn , Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath praised him with above compare So many thousand times Go , counselor . Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain . I’ll to the friar to know his remedy . If all else fail , myself have power to die .
Is the chair empty Is the sword unswayed Is the king dead , the empire unpossessed What heir of York is there alive but we And who is England’s king but great York’s heir Then tell me , what makes he upon the seas
Unless for that , my liege , I cannot guess .
Unless for that he comes to be your liege , You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes . Thou wilt revolt and fly to him , I fear .
No , my good lord . Therefore mistrust me not .
Where is thy power , then , to beat him back Where be thy tenants and thy followers Are they not now upon the western shore , Safe conducting the rebels from their ships
No , my good lord . My friends are in the north .
Cold friends to me . What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west
They have not been commanded , mighty king . Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave , I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please .
Ay , thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond , But I’ll not trust thee .
Business , my lord I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer .
Ha
Stays here longer .
Ay , but why
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress .
Satisfy The entreaties of your mistress satisfy Let that suffice . I have trusted thee , Camillo , With all the nearest things to my heart , as well My chamber councils , wherein , priest like , thou Hast cleansed my bosom , I from thee departed Thy penitent reform’d but we have been Deceived in thy integrity , deceived In that which seems so .
Be it forbid , my lord
To bide upon’t , thou art not honest , or , If thou inclinest that way , thou art a coward , Which hoxes honesty behind , restraining From course required or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust And therein negligent or else a fool That seest a game play’d home , the rich stake drawn , And takest it all for jest .
Then God be blessed , it is the blessèd sun . But sun it is not , when you say it is not , And the moon changes even as your mind . What you will have it named , even that it is , And so it shall be so for Katherine .
Petruchio , go thy ways the field is won .
Well , forward , forward Thus the bowl should run , And not unluckily against the bias . But , soft Company is coming here .
Good morrow , gentle mistress , where away Tell me , sweet Kate , and tell me truly too , Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman Such war of white and red within her cheeks What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty As those two eyes become that heavenly face Fair lovely maid , once more good day to thee . Sweet Kate , embrace her for her beauty’s sake .
He will make the man mad , to make a woman of him .
Young budding virgin , fair and fresh and sweet , Whither away , or where is thy abode Happy the parents of so fair a child . Happier the man whom favorable stars Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow
Do , do . We steal by line and level , an ’t like your grace .
I thank thee for that jest . Here’s a garment for ’t . Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country . Steal by line and level is an excellent pass of pate . There’s another garment for ’t .
Monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
I will have none on ’t . We shall lose our time , And all be turned to barnacles or to apes With foreheads villainous low .
Monster , lay to your fingers . Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom . Go to , carry this .
And this .
Ay , and this .
Hey , Mountain , hey
Silver . There it goes , Silver
Mistress , it is . Sweet lady , entertain him To be my fellow servant to your ladyship .
Too low a mistress for so high a servant .
Not so , sweet lady , but too mean a servant To have a look of such a worthy mistress .
Leave off discourse of disability . Sweet lady , entertain him for your servant .
My duty will I boast of , nothing else .
And duty never yet did want his meed . Servant , you are welcome to a worthless mistress .
I’ll die on him that says so but yourself .
That you are welcome
That you are worthless .
Madam , my lord your father would speak with you .
I wait upon his pleasure .
Come , Sir Thurio , Go with me . Once more , new servant , welcome . I’ll leave you to confer of home affairs . When you have done we look to hear from you .
We’ll both attend upon your ladyship .
On Thursday , sir The time is very short .
My father Capulet will have it so , And I am nothing slow to slack his haste .
You say you do not know the lady’s mind . Uneven is the course . I like it not .
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death , And therefore have I little talked of love , For Venus smiles not in a house of tears . Now , sir , her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway , And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears Which , too much minded by herself alone , May be put from her by society . Now do you know the reason of this haste .
I would I knew not why it should be slowed . Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
Happily met , my lady and my wife .
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
My gracious lord , I may be negligent , foolish and fearful In every one of these no man is free , But that his negligence , his folly , fear , Among the infinite doings of the world , Sometime puts forth . In your affairs , my lord , If ever I were wilful negligent , It was my folly if industriously I play’d the fool , it was my negligence , Not weighing well the end if ever fearful To do a thing , where I the issue doubted , Where of the execution did cry out Against the non performance , ’twas a fear Which oft infects the wisest these , my lord , Are such allow’d infirmities that honesty Is never free of . But , beseech your grace , Be plainer with me let me know my trespass By its own visage if I then deny it , ’Tis none of mine .
Ha’ not you seen , Camillo , But that’s past doubt , you have , or your eye glass Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn , or heard , For to a vision so apparent rumour Cannot be mute , or thought , for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think , My wife is slippery If thou wilt confess , Or else be impudently negative , To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought , then say My wife’s a hobby horse , deserves a name As rank as any flax wench that puts to Before her troth plight say’t and justify’t .
Roderigo killed And Cassio killed
No , Cassio is not killed .
Not Cassio killed Then murder’s out of tune , And sweet revenge grows harsh .
Oh , falsely , falsely murdered
Alas , what cry is that
That What
Out and alas , that was my lady’s voice .
Help Help , ho , help O lady , speak again Sweet Desdemona O sweet mistress , speak
A guiltless death I die .
Oh , who hath done this deed
Why , how now , Kate I hope thou art not mad . This is a man old , wrinkled , faded , withered And not a maiden , as thou say’st he is .
Pardon , old father , my mistaking eyes That have been so bedazzled with the sun That everything I look on seemeth green . Now I perceive thou art a reverend father . Pardon , I pray thee , for my mad mistaking .
Nobody . I myself . Farewell . Commend me to my kind lord . Oh , farewell
Do , good old grandsire , and withal make known Which way thou travellest . If along with us , We shall be joyful of thy company .
Why , how should she be murdered
Fair sir , and you , my merry mistress , That with your strange encounter much amazed me , My name is called Vincentio , my dwelling Pisa , And bound I am to Padua , there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen .
Alas , who knows
Fury , Fury There , Tyrant , there . Hark , hark
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions , shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps , and more pinch spotted make them Than pard or cat o mountain .
Hark , they roar .
Let them be hunted soundly . At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies . Shortly shall all my labors end , and thou Shalt have the air at freedom . For a little Follow , and do me service .
You heard her say herself it was not I .
What is his name
Lucentio , gentle sir .
Happily met , the happier for thy son . And now by law as well as reverend age , I may entitle thee my loving father . The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married . Wonder not Nor be grieved . She is of good esteem , Her dowry wealthy , and of worthy birth . Beside , so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman .
This was looked for at your hand , and this was balked . The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off , and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion , where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard , unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy .
An ’t be any way , it must be with valor , for policy I hate . I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician .
Why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor . Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him . Hurt him in eleven places . My niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor .
There is no way but this , Sir Andrew .
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him
Go , write it in a martial hand . Be curst and brief . It is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and full of invention . Taunt him with the license of ink . If thou thou est him some thrice , it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper , although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England , set em down . Go , about it . Let there be gall enough in thy ink , though thou write with a goose pen , no matter . About it .
Where shall I find you
That may be must be , love , on Thursday next .
What must be shall be .
That’s a certain text .
Come you to make confession to this Father
To answer that , I should confess to you .
Do not deny to him that you love me .
I will confess to you that I love him .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
The tears have got small victory by that , For it was bad enough before their spite .
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report .
That is no slander , sir , which is a truth , And what I spake , I spake it to my face .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
It may be so , for it is not mine own . Are you at leisure , holy Father , now , Or shall I come to you at evening mass
I would not be a stander by to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so , without My present vengeance taken ’shrew my heart , You never spoke what did become you less Than this which to reiterate were sin As deep as that , though true .
Is whispering nothing Is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses Kissing with inside lip stopping the career Of laughing with a sigh a note infallible Of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot Skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift Hours , minutes noon , midnight and all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs , theirs only , That would unseen be wicked is this nothing Why , then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing The covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing My wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings , If this be nothing .
Good my lord , be cured Of this diseased opinion , and betimes For ’tis most dangerous .
Say it be , ’tis true .
Now tell me , how do all from whence you came
Your friends are well and have them much commended .
And how do yours
I left them all in health .
How does your lady , and how thrives your love
My tales of love were wont to weary you I know you joy not in a love discourse .
Ay , Proteus , but that life is altered now . I have done penance for contemning Love , Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me With bitter fasts , with penitential groans , With nightly tears , and daily heartsore sighs For , in revenge of my contempt of love , Love hath chased sleep from my enthrallèd eyes And made them watchers of mine own heart’s sorrow . O gentle Proteus , Love’s a mighty lord , And hath so humbled me as I confess There is no woe to his correction , Nor to his service no such joy on earth . Now , no discourse , except it be of love Now can I break my fast , dine , sup , and sleep Upon the very naked name of love .
Enough . I read your fortune in your eye . Was this the idol that you worship so
Now does my project gather to a head . My charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time Goes upright with his carriage . How’s the day
On the sixth hour , at which time , my lord , You said our work should cease .
I did say so When first I raised the tempest . Say , my spirit , How fares the king and ’s followers
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge , Just as you left them , all prisoners , sir , In the line grove which weather fends your cell . They cannot budge till your release . The king , His brother , and yours , abide all three distracted , And the remainder mourning over them , Brimful of sorrow and dismay . But chiefly Him that you termed , sir , the good old Lord Gonzalo , His tears run down his beard like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds . Your charm so strongly works em That if you now beheld them , your affections Would become tender .
Dost thou think so , spirit
Mine would , sir , were I human .
Most mighty sovereign , You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful . I never was nor never will be false .
Go then and muster men , but leave behind Your son George Stanley . Look your heart be firm . Or else his head’s assurance is but frail .
So deal with him as I prove true to you .
My gracious sovereign , now in Devonshire , As I by friends am well advertisèd , Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate , Bishop of Exeter , his elder brother , With many more confederates are in arms .
In Kent , my liege , the Guilfords are in arms , And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels , and their power grows strong .
My lord , the army of great Buckingham
Out on you , owls Nothing but songs of death . He striketh him There , take thou that till thou bring better news .
No , no , my lord .
It is you lie , you lie I say thou liest , Camillo , and I hate thee , Pronounce thee a gross lout , a mindless slave , Or else a hovering temporizer , that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil , Inclining to them both were my wife’s liver Infected as her life , she would not live The running of one glass .
Who does infect her
Why , he that wears her like a medal , hanging About his neck , Bohemia who , if I Had servants true about me , that bare eyes To see alike mine honour as their profits , Their own particular thrifts , they would do that Which should undo more doing ay , and thou , His cupbearer , whom I from meaner form Have benched and reared to worship , who mayst see Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven , How I am galled , mightst bespice a cup , To give mine enemy a lasting wink Which draught to me were cordial .
Sir , my lord , I could do this , and that with no rash potion , But with a lingering dram that should not work Maliciously like poison but I cannot Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress , So sovereignly being honourable . I have loved thee ,
Let me embrace with old Vincentio , And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous .
But is this true , or is it else your pleasure , Like pleasant travelers , to break a jest Upon the company you overtake
I do assure thee , father , so it is .
Come , go along and see the truth hereof , For our first merriment hath made thee jealous .
Well , Petruchio , this has put me in heart . Have to my widow , and if she be froward , Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward .
Even she . And is she not a heavenly saint
No , but she is an earthly paragon .
Call her divine .
I will not flatter her .
O , flatter me , for love delights in praises .
When I was sick , you gave me bitter pills , And I must minister the like to you .
Then speak the truth by her if not divine , Yet let her be a principality , Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth .
Except my mistress .
Sweet , except not any , Except thou wilt except against my love .
Have I not reason to prefer mine own
And I will help thee to prefer her , too . She shall be dignified with this high honor To bear my lady’s train , lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss And , of so great a favor growing proud , Disdain to root the summer swelling flower And make rough winter everlastingly .
Why , Valentine , what braggartism is this
Pardon me , Proteus , all I can is nothing To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing . She is alone .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now . My lord , we must entreat the time alone .
God shield I should disturb devotion Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye . Till then , adieu , and keep this holy kiss .
O , shut the door And when thou hast done so , Come weep with me , past hope , past cure , past help .
O Juliet , I already know thy grief . It strains me past the compass of my wits . I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear’st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it . If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I’ll help it presently . God joined my heart and Romeo’s , thou our hands . And ere this hand , by thee to Romeo sealed , Shall be the label to another deed , Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another , this shall slay them both . Therefore out of thy long experienced time , Give me some present counsel , or , behold , Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire , arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honor bring . Be not so long to speak . I long to die If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy .
She said so . I must needs report the truth .
She’s like a liar gone to burning hell . Twas I that killed her .
Oh , the more angel she , And you the blacker devil
She turned to folly , and she was a whore .
Thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
She was false as water .
Thou art rash as fire , To say that she was false . Oh , she was heavenly true
Cassio did top her , ask thy husband else . Oh , I were damned beneath all depth in hell , But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity . Thy husband knew it all .
My husband
Thy husband .
That she was false to wedlock
Ay , with Cassio . Had she been true , If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite , I’d not have sold her for it .
My husband
We’ll call thee at the cubiculo . Go .
This is a dear manikin to you , Sir Toby .
I have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
We shall have a rare letter from him but you’ll not deliver ’t
Never trust me , then . And by all means stir on the youth to an answer . I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together . For Andrew , if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea , I’ll eat the rest of the anatomy .
Make that thy question , and go rot Dost think I am so muddy , so unsettled , To appoint myself in this vexation , sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets , Which to preserve is sleep , which being spotted Is goads , thorns , nettles , tails of wasps , Give scandal to the blood o’ the prince my son , Who I do think is mine and love as mine , Without ripe moving to’t Would I do this Could man so blench
I must believe you , sir I do and will fetch off Bohemia for’t Provided that , when he’s removed , your highness Will take again your queen as yours at first , Even for your son’s sake and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours .
Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down I’ll give no blemish to her honour , none .
My lord , Go then and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts , keep with Bohemia And with your queen . I am his cupbearer If from me he have wholesome beverage , Account me not your servant .
And his opposite , the youth , bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty .
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes .
If you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me . Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen , a very renegado . For there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness . He’s in yellow stockings .
Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .
I fly , Biondello . But they may chance to need thee at home . Therefore leave us .
Nay , faith , I’ll see the church a your back , and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can .
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while .
Sir , here’s the door . This is Lucentio’s house . My father’s bears more toward the marketplace . Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir .
You shall not choose but drink before you go . I think I shall command your welcome here , And , by all likelihood , some cheer is toward .
They’re busy within . You were best knock louder .
Then , let her alone .
Not for the world . Why , man , she is mine own , And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas , if all their sand were pearl , The water nectar , and the rocks pure gold . Forgive me that I do not dream on thee , Because thou seest me dote upon my love . My foolish rival , that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge , Is gone with her along , and I must after , For love , thou know’st , is full of jealousy .
But she loves you
Ay , and we are betrothed . Nay , more , our marriage hour , With all the cunning manner of our flight , Determined of how I must climb her window , The ladder made of cords , and all the means Plotted and ’greed on for my happiness . Good Proteus , go with me to my chamber , In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel .
Go on before I shall enquire you forth . I must unto the road , to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use , And then I’ll presently attend you .
The news I have to tell your Majesty Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters Buckingham’s army is dispersed and scattered , And he himself wandered away alone , No man knows whither .
I cry thee mercy . There is my purse to cure that blow of thine . He gives money Hath any well advisèd friend proclaimed Reward to him that brings the traitor in
Such proclamation hath been made , my lord .
Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset , Tis said , my liege , in Yorkshire are in arms . But this good comfort bring I to your Highness The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest . Richmond , in Dorsetshire , sent out a boat Unto the shore to ask those on the banks If they were his assistants , yea or no Who answered him they came from Buckingham Upon his party . He , mistrusting them , Hoisted sail and made his course for Brittany .
March on , march on , since we are up in arms , If not to fight with foreign enemies , Yet to beat down these rebels here at home .
And mine shall . Hast thou , which art but air , a touch , a feeling Of their afflictions , and shall not myself , One of their kind , that relish all as sharply Passion as they , be kindlier moved than thou art Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th quick , Yet with my nobler reason gainst my fury Do I take part . The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance . They being penitent , The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further . Go release them , Ariel . My charms I’ll break , their senses I’ll restore , And they shall be themselves .
I’ll fetch them , sir .
Ye elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes , and groves , And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back you demi puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make , Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms , that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid , Weak masters though ye be , I have bedimmed The noontide sun , called forth the mutinous winds , And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war to th dread rattling thunder Have I given fire , and rifted Jove’s stout oak
Ay , ’twas he that told me on her first . An honest man he is , and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds .
My husband
What needs this iterance , woman I say thy husband .
O mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love My husband say that she was false
He , woman . I say thy husband dost understand the word My friend , thy husband , honest , honest Iago .
If he say so , may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day He lies to th heart . She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
Ha
Do thy worst . This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her .
Peace , you were best .
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt . O gull O dolt As ignorant as dirt Thou hast done a deed I care not for thy sword , I’ll make thee known
This is all Do’t and thou hast the one half of my heart Do’t not , thou split’st thine own .
I’ll do’t , my lord .
I will seem friendly , as thou hast advised me .
O miserable lady But , for me , What case stand I in I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes and my ground to do’t Is the obedience to a master , one Who in rebellion with himself will have All that are his so too . To do this deed , Promotion follows . If I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings And flourish’d after , I’ld not do’t but since Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one , Let villany itself forswear’t . I must Forsake the court to do’t , or no , is certain To me a break neck . Happy star , reign now Here comes Bohemia .
This is strange methinks My favour here begins to warp . Not speak Good day , Camillo .
Hold , daughter . I do spy a kind of hope , Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent . If , rather than to marry County Paris , Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame , That copest with death himself to ’scape from it . An if thou darest , I’ll give thee remedy .
O , bid me leap , rather than marry Paris , From off the battlements of yonder tower Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears Or shut me nightly in a charnel house , O ercovered quite with dead men’s rattling bones , With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls Or bid me go into a new made grave And hide me with a dead man in his shroud Things that , to hear them told , have made me tremble And I will do it without fear or doubt , To live an unstained wife to my sweet love .
Hold , then . Go home , be merry . Give consent To marry Paris . Wednesday is tomorrow . Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone . Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber . Take thou this vial , being then in bed , And this distillèd liquor drink thou off , When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humor , for no pulse Shall keep his native progress , but surcease . No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest . The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes , thy eyes windows fall Like death when he shuts up the day of life . Each part , deprived of supple government , Shall , stiff and stark and cold , appear like death . And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours , And then awake as from a pleasant sleep . Now , when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead . Then , as the manner of our country is , In thy best robes uncovered on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie . In the meantime , against thou shalt awake , Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift , And hither shall he come , and he and I Will watch thy waking , and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua . And this shall free thee from this present shame , If no inconstant toy , nor womanish fear , Abate thy valor in the acting it .
Will you make haste
I will . Even as one heat another heat expels , Or as one nail by strength drives out another , So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten . Is it my mind , or Valentine’s praise , Her true perfection , or my false transgression That makes me , reasonless , to reason thus She is fair and so is Julia that I love That I did love , for now my love is thawed , Which like a waxen image ’gainst a fire Bears no impression of the thing it was . Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold , And that I love him not as I was wont . O , but I love his lady too , too much , And that’s the reason I love him so little . How shall I dote on her with more advice , That thus without advice begin to love her ’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld , And that hath dazzlèd my reason’s light But when I look on her perfections , There is no reason but I shall be blind . If I can check my erring love , I will If not , to compass her I’ll use my skill .
What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate
Is Signior Lucentio within , sir
He’s within , sir , but not to be spoken withal .
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself . He shall need none so long as I live .
Nay , I told you your son was well beloved in Padua . Do you hear , sir To leave frivolous circumstances , I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him .
Thou liest . His father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window .
Art thou his father
Ay , sir , so his mother says , if I may believe her .
Hail , most royal sir
What is the news i’ the court
None rare , my lord .
The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province and a region Loved as he loves himself even now I met him With customary compliment when he , Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling A lip of much contempt , speeds from me and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changeth thus his manners .
I dare not know , my lord .
How dare not do not . Do you know , and dare not Be intelligent to me ’tis thereabouts For , to yourself , what you do know , you must . And cannot say , you dare not . Good Camillo , Your changed complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine changed too for I must be A party in this alteration , finding Myself thus alter’d with ’t .
There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper , but I cannot name the disease and it is caught Of you that yet are well .
Though I lost twenty lives . Help Help , ho Help The Moor hath killed my mistress Murder , murder
What is the matter How now , general
Oh , are you come , Iago You have done well , That men must lay their murders on your neck .
What is the matter
Disprove this villain , if thou be’st a man . He says thou told’st him that his wife was false . I know thou didst not , thou rt not such a villain . Speak , for my heart is full .
I told him what I thought , and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true .
But did you ever tell him she was false
I did .
You told a lie , an odious , damnèd lie . Upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie . She false with Cassio Did you say with Cassio
With Cassio , mistress . Go to , charm your tongue .
I will not charm my tongue , I am bound to speak . My mistress here lies murdered in her bed
Oh , heavens forfend
Why , how now , gentleman Why , this is flat knavery to take upon you another man’s name .
Lay hands on the villain . I believe he means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance .
I have seen them in the church together . God send em good shipping But who is here Mine old master Vincentio Now we are undone and brought to nothing .
Come hither , crack hemp .
Hope I may choose , sir .
Come hither , you rogue What , have you forgot me
Forgot you No , sir . I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life .
What , you notorious villain , didst thou never see thy master’s father , Vincentio
What , my old worshipful old master Yes , marry , sir . See where he looks out of the window .
Is ’t so , indeed .
Help , help , help Here’s a madman will murder me .
And cross gartered
Most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i the church . I have dogged him , like his murderer . He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him . He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies . You have not seen such a thing as ’tis . I can hardly forbear hurling things at him . I know my lady will strike him . If she do , he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor .
Give me , give me O , tell not me of fear
Come , bring us , bring us where he is .
Hold . Get you gone . Be strong and prosperous In this resolve . I’ll send a friar with speed To Mantua with my letters to thy lord .
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford . Farewell , dear Father .
How caught of me Make me not sighted like the basilisk I have look’d on thousands , who have sped the better By my regard , but kill’d none so . Camillo , As you are certainly a gentleman , thereto Clerk like experienced , which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents’ noble names , In whose success we are gentle , I beseech you , If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform’d , imprison’t not In ignorant concealment .
Lance , by mine honesty , welcome to Milan
I may not answer .
Forswear not thyself , sweet youth , for I am not welcome . I reckon this always , that a man is never undone till he be hanged , nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say Welcome
A sickness caught of me , and yet I well I must be answer’d . Dost thou hear , Camillo , I conjure thee , by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge , whereof the least Is not this suit of mine , that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me how far off , how near Which way to be prevented , if to be If not , how best to bear it .
Come on , you madcap , I’ll to the alehouse with you presently , where , for one shot of five pence , thou shalt have five thousand welcomes . But , sirrah , how did thy master part with Madam Julia
Sir , I will tell you Since I am charged in honour and by him That I think honourable therefore mark my counsel , Which must be even as swiftly follow’d as I mean to utter it , or both yourself and me Cry lost , and so good night
Marry , after they closed in earnest , they parted very fairly in jest .
But shall she marry him
No .
How then Shall he marry her
No , neither .
What , are they broken
No , they are both as whole as a fish .
Why , then , how stands the matter with them
Marry , thus when it stands well with him , it stands well with her .
What an ass art thou I understand thee not .
What a block art thou , that thou canst not My staff understands me .
What thou sayest
Ay , and what I do too . Look thee , I’ll but lean , and my staff understands me .
It stands under thee , indeed .
Why , stand under and under stand is all one .
My liege , the duke of Buckingham is taken . That is the best news . That the earl of Richmond Is with a mighty power landed at Milford , Is colder tidings , yet they must be told .
Away towards Salisbury While we reason here , A royal battle might be won and lost . Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury . The rest march on with me .
With his own bolt the strong based promontory Have I made shake , and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar graves at my command Have waked their sleepers , oped , and let em forth By my so potent art . But this rough magic I here abjure , and when I have required Some heavenly music , which even now I do , To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for , I’ll break my staff , Bury it certain fathoms in the earth , And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book .
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , Now useless , boiled within thy skull . There stand , For you are spell stopped . O good Gonzalo , My true preserver and a loyal sir
But tell me true , will ’t be a match
Ask my dog . If he say ay , it will if he say no , it will if he shake his tail and say nothing , it will .
The conclusion is then that it will .
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable .
And your reports have set the murder on .
Nay , stare not , masters , it is true , indeed .
Tis a strange truth .
Oh , monstrous act
Villainy , villainy , villainy I think upon ’t , I think I smell ’t , Oh , villainy I thought so then , I’ll kill myself for grief . Oh , villainy , villainy
What , are you mad I charge you , get you home .
Good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak . Tis proper I obey him , but not now . Perchance , Iago , I will ne er go home .
Oh Oh Oh
Nay , lay thee down and roar , For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e er did lift up eye .
Oh , she was foul I scarce did know you , uncle . There lies your niece , Whose breath , indeed , these hands have newly stopped . I know this act shows horrible and grim .
Poor Desdemon I am glad thy father’s dead , Thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain . Did he live now ,
Help , son Help , Signior Baptista
Prithee , Kate , let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy .
Sir , what are you that offer to beat my servant
What am I , sir Nay , what are you , sir O immortal gods O fine villain A silken doublet , a velvet hose , a scarlet cloak , and a copatain hat Oh , I am undone , I am undone While I play the good husband at home , my son and my servant spend all at the university .
How now , what’s the matter
What , is the man lunatic
Sir , you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit , but your words show you a madman . Why , sir , what cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold I thank my good father I am able to maintain it .
Thy father O villain He is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
On , good Camillo .
I am appointed him to murder you .
By whom , Camillo
So many guests invite as here are writ .
By the king .
For what
Sirrah , go hire me twenty cunning cooks .
He thinks , nay , with all confidence he swears , As he had seen’t or been an instrument To vice you to’t , that you have touch’d his queen Forbiddenly .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers .
How canst thou try them so
O , then my best blood turn To an infected jelly and my name Be yoked with his that did betray the Best Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive , and my approach be shunn’d , Nay , hated too , worse than the great’st infection That e’er was heard or read
Marry , sir , ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers . Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me .
Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences , you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly , whose foundation Is piled upon his faith and will continue The standing of his body .
Go , be gone . We shall be much unfurnished for this time .
What , is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence
Ay , forsooth .
Well , he may chance to do some good on her . A peevish self willed harlotry it is .
How should this grow
I know not but I am sure ’tis safer to Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born . If therefore you dare trust my honesty , That lies enclosed in this trunk which you Shall bear along impawn’d , away to night Your followers I will whisper to the business , And will by twos and threes at several posterns Clear them o’ the city . For myself , I’ll put My fortunes to your service , which are here By this discovery lost . Be not uncertain For , by the honour of my parents , I Have utter’d truth which if you seek to prove , I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer Than one condemn’d by the king’s own mouth , thereon His execution sworn .
I do believe thee I saw his heart in ’s face . Give me thy hand Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbour mine . My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago . This jealousy Is for a precious creature as she’s rare , Must it be great , and as his person’s mighty , Must it be violent , and as he does conceive He is dishonour’d by a man which ever Profess’d to him , why , his revenges must In that be made more bitter . Fear o’ershades me Good expedition be my friend , and comfort The gracious queen , part of his theme , but nothing Of his ill ta’en suspicion Come , Camillo I will respect thee as a father if Thou bear’st my life off hence let us avoid .
To him you follow’st , I will pay thy graces Home both in word and deed . Ariel , Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell . I will discase me , and myself present As I was sometime Milan . Quickly , spirit . Thou shalt ere long be free .
Where the bee sucks , there suck I . In a cowslip’s bell I lie . There I couch when owls do cry . On the bat’s back I do fly After summer merrily . Merrily , merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough .
Why , that’s my dainty Ariel . I shall miss thee , But yet thou shalt have freedom . So , so , so . To the king’s ship , invisible as thou art . There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
You mistake , sir , you mistake , sir . Pray , what do you think is his name
His name As if I knew not his name I have brought him up ever since he was three years old , and his name is Tranio .
I would not by my will have troubled you , But , since you make your pleasure of your pains , I will no further chide you .
Away , away , mad ass His name is Lucentio and he is mine only son , and heir to the lands of me , Signior Vincentio .
I could not stay behind you . My desire , More sharp than filèd steel , did spur me forth . And not all love to see you , though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage , But jealousy what might befall your travel , Being skilless in these parts , which to a stranger , Unguided and unfriended , often prove Rough and unhospitable . My willing love , The rather by these arguments of fear , Set forth in your pursuit .
Lucentio Oh , he hath murdered his master Lay hold on him , I charge you in the Duke’s name . O my son , my son Tell me , thou villain , where is my son Lucentio
Call forth an officer .
My kind Antonio , I can no other answer make but thanks , And thanks , and ever thanks . And oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay . But were my worth as is my conscience , firm , You should find better dealing . What’s to do Shall we go see the relics of this town
Tomorrow , sir . Best first go see your lodging .
Carry this mad knave to the jail . Father Baptista , I charge you see that he be forthcoming .
I am not weary , and ’tis long to night I pray you , let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city .
Carry me to the jail
Stay , officer . He shall not go to prison .
Talk not , Signior Gremio . I say he shall go to prison .
Take heed , Signior Baptista , lest you be cony catched in this business . I dare swear this is the right Vincentio .
Swear , if thou darest .
This sight would make him do a desperate turn , Yea , curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation .
Tis pitiful , but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed . Cassio confessed it , And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her . I saw it in his hand , It was a handkerchief , an antique token My father gave my mother .
Oh , heaven Oh , heavenly powers
Zounds , hold your peace .
Twill out , ’twill out . I peace No , I will speak as liberal as the north . Let heaven and men and devils , let them all , All , all cry shame against me , yet I’ll speak .
Be wise , and get you home .
I will not .
Fie Your sword upon a woman
Sir Christopher , tell Richmond this from me That in the sty of the most deadly boar My son George Stanley is franked up in hold If I revolt , off goes young George’s head The fear of that holds off my present aid . So get three gone . Commend me to thy lord . Withal , say that the queen hath heartily consented He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter . But , tell me , where is princely Richmond now
O thou dull Moor That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband . For often , with a solemn earnestness More than indeed belonged to such a trifle He begged of me to steal it .
At Pembroke , or at Ha rfordwest in Wales .
What men of name resort to him
Sir Walter Herbert , a renownèd soldier Sir Gilbert Talbot , Sir William Stanley , Oxford , redoubted Pembroke , Sir James Blunt , And Rice ap Thomas , with a valiant crew , And many other of great name and worth And towards London they do bend their power , If by the way they be not fought withal .
Well , hie thee to thy lord . I kiss his hand . My letter will resolve him of my mind . Farewell .
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .
How now , my headstrong Where have you been gadding
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon . Pardon , I beseech you Henceforward I am ever ruled by you .
Send for the county . Go tell him of this . I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence cell , And gave him what becomèd love I might , Not stepping o er the bounds of modesty .
Why , I am glad on ’t . This is well . Stand up .
This is as ’t should be . Let me see the county . Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither . Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar Our whole city is much bound to him .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow
’Tis well that I get it so . But , Lance , how sayest thou , that my master is become a notable lover
I never knew him otherwise .
Than how
A notable lubber , as thou reportest him to be .
Why , thou whoreson ass , thou mistak’st me .
Why , fool , I meant not thee . I meant thy master .
I tell thee , my master is become a hot lover .
Why , I tell thee I care not , though he burn himself in love . If thou wilt , go with me to the alehouse if not , thou art an Hebrew , a Jew , and not worth the name of a Christian .
Why
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian . Wilt thou go
At thy service .
It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns please your highness To take the urgent hour . Come , sir , away .
Under the hatches . The Master and the Boatswain Being awake , enforce them to this place , And presently , I prithee .
I drink the air before me , and return Or ere your pulse twice beat .
All torment , trouble , wonder , and amazement Inhabits here . Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country

Whe er thou beest he or no , Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me , As late I have been , I not know . Thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood . And since I saw thee , Th affliction of my mind amends , with which I fear a madness held me . This must crave An if this be at all a most strange story . Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs . But how should Prospero Be living and be here
First , noble friend , Let me embrace thine age , whose honor cannot Be measured or confined .
Nay , I dare not swear it .
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio .
Yes , I know thee to be Signior Lucentio .
Away with the dotard To the jail with him
Thus strangers may be haled and abused . O monstrous villain
O We are spoiled and yonder he is Deny him , forswear him , or else we are all undone .
Pardon , sweet father .
Lives my sweet son
Pardon , dear father .
How hast thou offended Where is Lucentio
Here’s Lucentio , right son to the right Vincentio , That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne .
Take the boy to you he so troubles me , ‘Tis past enduring .
To leave my Julia , shall I be forsworn To love fair Sylvia , shall I be forsworn To wrong my friend , I shall be much forsworn . And ev’n that power which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury . Love bade me swear , and Love bids me forswear . O sweet suggesting Love , if thou hast sinned , Teach me , thy tempted subject , to excuse it At first I did adore a twinkling star , But now I worship a celestial sun . Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken , And he wants wit that wants resolvèd will To learn his wit t’ exchange the bad for better . Fie , fie , unreverent tongue , to call her bad Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred With twenty thousand soul confirming oaths I cannot leave to love , and yet I do But there I leave to love where I should love . Julia I lose , and Valentine I lose . If I keep them , I needs must lose myself . If I lose them , thus find I by their loss For Valentine , myself for Julia , Sylvia . I to myself am dearer than a friend , For love is still most precious in itself , And Sylvia witness heaven , that made her fair Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiop . I will forget that Julia is alive , Remembering that my love to her is dead And Valentine I’ll hold an enemy , Aiming at Sylvia as a sweeter friend . I cannot now prove constant to myself Without some treachery used to Valentine . This night he meaneth with a corded ladder To climb celestial Sylvia’s chamber window , Myself in counsel , his competitor . Now presently I’ll give her father notice Of their disguising and pretended flight , Who , all enraged , will banish Valentine For Thurio , he intends , shall wed his daughter But , Valentine being gone , I’ll quickly cross By some sly trick blunt Thurio’s dull proceeding . Love , lend me wings to make my purpose swift , As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift
Come , my gracious lord , Shall I be your playfellow
No , I’ll none of you .
Why , my sweet lord
You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if I were a baby still . I love you better .
And why so , my lord
Not for because Your brows are blacker yet black brows , they say , Become some women best , so that there be not Too much hair there , but in a semicircle Or a half moon made with a pen .
Who taught you this
I learnt it out of women’s faces . Pray now What colour are your eyebrows
Blue , my lord .
Nay , that’s a mock I have seen a lady’s nose That has been blue , but not her eyebrows .
Hark ye The queen your mother rounds apace we shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days and then you’ld wanton with us , If we would have you .
No , not till Thursday . There is time enough .
Go , Nurse . Go with her . We’ll to church tomorrow .
We shall be short in our provision . Tis now near night .
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife . Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her . I’ll not to bed tonight . Let me alone . I’ll play the housewife for this once .
Whether this be Or be not , I’ll not swear .
What , ho They are all forth Well , I will walk myself To County Paris , to prepare him up Against tomorrow . My heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed .
You do yet taste Some subtleties o th isle , that will not let you Believe things certain . Welcome , my friends all . But you , my brace of lords , were I so minded , I here could pluck his highness frown upon you And justify you traitors . At this time I will tell no tales .
The devil speaks in him .
No . For you , most wicked sir , whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth , I do forgive Thy rankest fault , all of them , and require My dukedom of thee , which perforce , I know , Thou must restore .
If thou beest Prospero , Give us particulars of thy preservation , How thou hast met us here , whom three hours since Were wracked upon this shore , where I have lost How sharp the point of this remembrance is My dear son Ferdinand .
I am woe for ’t , sir .
Irreparable is the loss , and patience Says it is past her cure .
Here’s packing , with a witness , to deceive us all
Villainous whore
She give it Cassio No , alas , I found it And I did give ’t my husband .
Filth , thou liest
By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen . O murderous coxcomb What should such a fool Do with so good a wife
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder Precious villain
The woman falls Sure he hath killed his wife .
Ay , ay . Oh , lay me by my mistress side .
He’s gone , but his wife’s killed .
Tis a notorious villain . Take you this weapon , Which I have recovered from the Moor . Come , guard the door without . Let him not pass , But kill him rather . I’ll after that same villain , For ’tis a damnèd slave .
Where is that damnèd villain , Tranio , That faced and braved me in this matter so
Why , tell me , is not this my Cambio
Cambio is changed into Lucentio .
Love wrought these miracles . Bianca’s love Made me exchange my state with Tranio , While he did bear my countenance in the town , And happily I have arrivèd at the last Unto the wishèd haven of my bliss . What Tranio did , myself enforced him to . Then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .
I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the jail .
But do you hear , sir , have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill
Fear not , Baptista , we will content you . Go to . But I will in to be revenged for this villany .
And I , to sound the depth of this knavery .
Look not pale , Bianca . Thy father will not frown .
Will not King Richard let me speak with him
No , my good lord . Therefore be patient .
Hastings and Edward’s children , Grey and Rivers , Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward , Vaughan , and all that have miscarrièd By underhand , corrupted , foul injustice , If that your moody , discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour , Even for revenge mock my destruction . This is All Souls Day , fellow , is it not
It is .
She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
What wisdom stirs amongst you Come , sir , now I am for you again pray you , sit by us , And tell ’s a tale .
Merry or sad shall’t be
As merry as you will .
A sad tale’s best for winter I have one Of sprites and goblins .
Let’s have that , good sir . Come on , sit down come on , and do your best To fright me with your sprites you’re powerful at it .
There was a man
Nay , come , sit down then on .
Would you’d pardon me I do not without danger walk these streets Once in a sea fight gainst the Count his galleys I did some service , of such note indeed , That were I ta en here it would scarce be answered .
Dwelt by a churchyard I will tell it softly Yond crickets shall not hear it .
Belike you slew great number of his people
Come on , then , And give’t me in mine ear .
The offence is not of such a bloody nature Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument . It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them , which , for traffic’s sake , Most of our city did . Only myself stood out For which , if I be lapsèd in this place , I shall pay dear .
Was he met there his train Camillo with him
Do not then walk too open .
Behind the tuft of pines I met them never Saw I men scour so on their way I eyed them Even to their ships .
It doth not fit me . Hold , sir , here’s my purse . In the south suburbs , at the Elephant , Is best to lodge . I will bespeak our diet , Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town . There shall you have me .
Why I your purse
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase , and your store , I think , is not for idle markets , sir .
I’ll be your purse bearer and leave you For an hour .
Why , then All Souls Day is my body’s doomsday . This is the day which , in King Edward’s time , I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies . This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted . This , this All Souls Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs . That high All seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest .
Ay , those attires are best . But , gentle Nurse , I pray thee , leave me to myself tonight , For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state , Which , well thou know’st , is cross and full of sin .
What , are you busy , ho Need you my help
No , madam . We have culled such necessaries As are behooveful for our state tomorrow . So please you , let me now be left alone , And let the Nurse this night sit up with you . For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .
Good night . Get thee to bed and rest , for thou hast need .
Farewell God knows when we shall meet again . I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life . I’ll call them back again to comfort me . Nurse What should she do here
To the Elephant .
I do remember .
Counsel , Lucetta . Gentle girl , assist me And ev’n in kind love I do conjure thee , Who art the table wherein all my thoughts Are visibly charactered and engraved , To lesson me and tell me some good means How , with my honor , I may undertake A journey to my loving Proteus .
Alas , the way is wearisome and long
A true devoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps Much less shall she that hath Love’s wings to fly , And when the flight is made to one so dear , Of such divine perfection , as Sir Proteus .
How blest am I In my just censure , in my true opinion Alack , for lesser knowledge how accursed In being so blest There may be in the cup A spider steep’d , and one may drink , depart , And yet partake no venom , for his knowledge Is not infected but if one present The abhorr’d ingredient to his eye , make known How he hath drunk , he cracks his gorge , his sides , With violent hefts . I have drunk , and seen the spider . Camillo was his help in this , his pander There is a plot against my life , my crown All’s true that is mistrusted that false villain Whom I employ’d was pre employ’d by him He has discover’d my design , and I Remain a pinch’d thing yea , a very trick For them to play at will . How came the posterns So easily open
By his great authority Which often hath no less prevail’d than so On your command .
Better forbear till Proteus make return .
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters bosoms . Thus Margaret’s curse falls heavy upon my neck When he , quoth she , shall split thy heart with sorrow , Remember Margaret was a prophetess . Come , lead me , officers , to the block of shame . Wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame .
O , know’st thou not his looks are my soul’s food Pity the dearth that I have pinèd in By longing for that food so long a time . Didst thou but know the inly touch of love , Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words .
I do not seek to quench your love’s hot fire , But qualify the fire’s extreme rage , Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason .
I know’t too well . Give me the boy I am glad you did not nurse him Though he does bear some signs of me , yet you Have too much blood in him .
I rather think You have not sought her help , of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid , And rest myself content .
You the like loss
As great to me as late . And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you , for I Have lost my daughter .
A daughter O heavens , that they were living both in Naples , The king and queen there That they were , I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies . When did you lose your daughter
In this last tempest . I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth , their words Are natural breath . But howsoev r you have Been justled from your senses , know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan , who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked , was landed , To be the lord on ’t .
My cake is dough , but I’ll in among the rest , Out of hope of all but my share of the feast .
Husband , let’s follow to see the end of this ado .
First kiss me , Kate , and we will .
What , in the midst of the street
What , art thou ashamed of me
No , sir , God forbid , but ashamed to kiss .
Why , then let’s home again . Come , sirrah , let’s away .
Nay , I will give thee a kiss . Now pray thee , love , stay .
Is not this well Come , my sweet Kate . Better once than never , for never too late .
I am not valiant neither , But ever puny whipster gets my sword . But why should honor outlive honesty Let it go all .
What did thy song bode , lady Hark , canst thou hear me I will play the swan . And die in music . Willow , willow , willow Moor , she was chaste , she loved thee , cruel Moor . So come my soul to bliss , as I speak true . So speaking as I think , alas , I die .
I have another weapon in this chamber , It was a sword of Spain , the ice brook’s temper . Oh , here it is . Uncle , I must come forth .
If thou attempt it , it will cost thee dear . Thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer .
Look in upon me then and speak with me , Or , naked as I am , I will assault thee .
What is the matter
Behold , I have a weapon . A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier’s thigh . I have seen the day
My dismal scene I needs must act alone . Come , vial . What if it be a poison , which the friar Subtly hath ministered to have me dead , Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored Because he married me before to Romeo I fear it is . And yet , methinks , it should not , For he hath still been tried a holy man . How if , when I am laid into the tomb , I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me There’s a fearful point . Shall I not , then , be stifled in the vault To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in , And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes Or , if I live , is it not very like The horrible conceit of death and night , Together with the terror of the place As in a vault , an ancient receptacle , Where for these many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed Where bloody Tybalt , yet but green in earth , Lies festering in his shroud where , as they say , At some hours in the night spirits resort Alack , alack , is it not like that I , So early waking , what with loathsome smells , And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth , That living mortals , hearing them , run mad
Fellows in arms , and my most loving friends , Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny , Have we marched on without impediment , Thus far into the bowels of the land And here receive we from our father Stanley Lines of fair comfort and encouragement . The wretched , bloody , and usurping boar , That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines , Swills your warm blood like wash , and makes his trough In your embowelled bosoms this foul swine Is now even in the center of this isle , Near to the town of Leicester , as we learn . From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march . In God’s name , cheerly on , courageous friends , To reap the harvest of perpetual peace By this one bloody trial of sharp war .
Every man’s conscience is a thousand men , To fight against this guilty homicide .
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us .
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear . Which in his dearest need will fly from him .
All for our vantage . Then , in God’s name , march . True hope is swift , and flies with swallow’s wings . Kings it makes gods , and meaner creatures kings .
No more yet of this , For ’tis a chronicle of day by day , Not a relation for a breakfast , nor Befitting this first meeting . Welcome , sir . This cell’s my court . Here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad . Pray you , look in . My dukedom since you have given me again , I will requite you with as good a thing , At least bring forth a wonder to content ye As much as me my dukedom .
Sweet lord , you play me false .
No , my dearest love , I would not for the world .
Yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , And I would call it fair play .
If this prove A vision of the Island , one dear son Shall I twice lose .
A most high miracle
Though the seas threaten , they are merciful . I have cursed them without cause .
What is this sport
Bear the boy hence he shall not come about her Away with him and let her sport herself With that she’s big with for ’tis Polixenes Has made thee swell thus .
But I’ld say he had not , And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying , Howe’er you lean to the nayward .
You , my lords , Look on her , mark her well be but about To say ‘she is a goodly lady , ’ and The justice of your hearts will thereto add ‘Tis pity she’s not honest , honourable ’ Praise her but for this her without door form , Which on my faith deserves high speech , and straight The shrug , the hum or ha , these petty brands That calumny doth use O , I am out That mercy does , for calumny will sear Virtue itself these shrugs , these hums and ha’s , When you have said ‘she’s goodly , ’ come between Ere you can say ‘she’s honest ’ but be ’t known , From him that has most cause to grieve it should be , She’s an adulteress .
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop . But , oh , vain boast Who can control his fate ’tis not so now . Be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed . Here is my journey’s end , here is my butt , And very sea mark of my utmost sail . Do you go back dismayed ’tis a lost fear . Man but a rush against Othello’s breast , And he retires . Where should Othello go Now , how dost thou look now O ill starred wench , Pale as thy smock When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it . Cold , cold , my girl , Even like thy chastity . O cursed , cursed slave Whip me , ye devils , From the possession of this heavenly sight Blow me about in winds , roast me in sulfur , Wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire Oh , Desdemona Desdemona dead Oh Oh
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man
That’s he that was Othello . Here I am .
Where is that viper Bring the villain forth .
I have sent after him . He says he’ll come . How shall I feast him What bestow of him For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow’d . I speak too loud . Where’s Malvolio He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes . Where is Malvolio
He’s coming , madam but in very strange manner . He is sure possessed , madam .
Why , what’s the matter Does he rave
No , madam , he does nothing but smile . Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come , for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits .
Go call him hither .
I am as mad as he , If sad and merry madness equal be .
How now , Malvolio
Sweet lady , ho , ho .
Oh , if I wake , shall I not be distraught , Environèd with all these hideous fears , And madly play with my forefather’s joints , And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud , And , in this rage , with some great kinsman’s bone , As with a club , dash out my desperate brains Oh , look Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point . Stay , Tybalt , stay Romeo , Romeo , Romeo Here’s drink . I drink to thee .
The more thou damm’st it up , the more it burns . The current that with gentle murmur glides , Thou know’st , being stopped , impatiently doth rage But when his fair course is not hinderèd , He makes sweet music with th’ enameled stones , Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage , And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport to the wild ocean . Then let me go , and hinder not my course . I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step , Till the last step have brought me to my love , And there I’ll rest , as after much turmoil A blessèd soul doth in Elysium .
But in what habit will you go along
Not like a woman , for I would prevent The loose encounters of lascivious men . Gentle Lucetta , fit me with such weeds As may beseem some well reputed page .
Why , then , your ladyship must cut your hair .
No , girl , I’ll knit it up in silken strings With twenty odd conceited true love knots . To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be .
Now all the blessings Of a glad father , compass thee about . Arise , and say how thou camest here .
Oh , wonder How many goodly creatures are there here How beauteous mankind is O brave new world , That has such people in ’t
Tis new to thee .
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours . Is she the goddess that hath severed us And brought us thus together
Sir , she is mortal . But by immortal providence , she’s mine . I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice , nor thought I had one . She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan , Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before , of whom I have Received a second life . And second father This lady makes him to me .
I am hers . But oh , how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness
There , sir , stop . Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone .
I look down towards his feet , but that’s a fable . If that thou be’st a devil , I cannot kill thee .
Wrench his sword from him .
I bleed , sir , but not killed .
I am not sorry neither . I’d have thee live , For in my sense ’tis happiness to die .
O thou Othello , thou was once so good , Fall n in the practice of a cursèd slave , What shall be said to thee
Why , anything . An honorable murderer , if you will , For naught I did in hate , but all in honor .
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy . Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death
Ay .
Dear general , I never gave you cause .
I do believe it , and I ask your pardon . Will you , I pray , demand that demi devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
Here pitch our tent , even here in Bosworth field . My Lord of Surrey , why look you so sad
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
My Lord of Norfolk
Here , most gracious liege .
Norfolk , we must have knocks , ha , must we not
We must both give and take , my loving lord .
Up with my tent Here will I lie tonight . But where tomorrow Well , all’s one for that . Who hath descried the number of the traitors
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
Why , our battalia trebles that account . Besides , the king’s name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want . Up with the tent Come , noble gentlemen , Let us survey the vantage of the ground . Call for some men of sound direction . Let’s lack no discipline , make no delay , For , lords , tomorrow is a busy day .
At last , though long , our jarring notes agree , And time it is when raging war is done To smile at ’scapes and perils overblown . My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine . Brother Petruchio , sister Katherina , And thou , Hortensio , with thy loving widow , Feast with the best , and welcome to my house . My banquet is to close our stomachs up , After our great good cheer . Pray you , sit down , For now we sit to chat as well as eat .
Nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat
Padua affords this kindness , son Petruchio .
Padua affords nothing but what is kind .
For both our sakes , I would that word were true .
Now , for my life , Hortensio fears his widow .
Should a villain say so , The most replenish’d villain in the world , He were as much more villain you , my lord , Do but mistake .
You have mistook , my lady , Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place , Lest barbarism , making me the precedent , Should a like language use to all degrees And mannerly distinguishment leave out Betwixt the prince and beggar I have said She’s an adulteress I have said with whom More , she’s a traitor and Camillo is A federary with her , and one that knows What she should shame to know herself But with her most vile principal , that she’s A bed swerver , even as bad as those That vulgars give bold’st titles , ay , and privy To this their late escape .
No , by my life . Privy to none of this . How will this grieve you , When you shall come to clearer knowledge , that You thus have publish’d me Gentle my lord , You scarce can right me throughly then to say You did mistake .
What fashion , madam , shall I make your breeches
That fits as well as Tell me , good my lord , What compass will you wear your farthingale Why , even what fashion thou best likes , Lucetta .
You must needs have them with a codpiece , madam .
Out , out , Lucetta That will be ill favored .
A round hose , madam , now’s not worth a pin Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on .
Lucetta , as thou lov’st me , let me have What thou think’st meet and is most mannerly . But tell me , wench , how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey I fear me it will make me scandalized .
If you think so , then stay at home and go not .
Nay , that I will not .
Then never dream on infamy , but go . If Proteus like your journey when you come , No matter who’s displeased when you are gone . I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal .
That is the least , Lucetta , of my fear . A thousand oaths , an ocean of his tears , And instances of infinite of love , Warrant me welcome to my Proteus .
I have inly wept , Or should have spoke ere this . Look down , you gods , And on this couple drop a blessèd crown , For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither .
I say amen , Gonzalo .
Was Milan thrust from Milan , that his issue Should become kings of Naples O , rejoice Beyond a common joy , and set it down With gold on lasting pillars . In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis And Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife Where he himself was lost Prospero , his dukedom In a poor isle and all of us , ourselves When no man was his own .
Give me your hands . Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy .
Be it so . Amen .
Oh , look , sir , look , sir Here is more of us . I prophesied if a gallows were on land , This fellow could not drown . Now , blasphemy , That swear’st grace o erboard , not an oath on shore Hast thou no mouth by land What is the news
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .
Smilest thou I sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
Sad , lady I could be sad . This does make some obstruction in the blood , this cross gartering , but what of that If it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , Please one , and please all .
Come , stir , stir , stir The second cock hath crowed . The curfew bell hath rung . Tis three o clock . Look to the baked meats , good Angelica . Spare not for the cost .
Why , how dost thou , man What is the matter with thee
Go , you cot quean , go . Get you to bed , faith . You’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching .
Not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs . It did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed . I think we do know the sweet Roman hand .
No , not a whit , what . I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne er been sick .
Wilt thou go to bed , Malvolio
Ay , you have been a mouse hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .
To bed Ay , sweetheart , and I’ll come to thee .
God comfort thee Why dost thou smile so , and kiss thy hand so oft
A jealous hood , a jealous hood
How do you , Malvolio
Now , fellow , What is there
At your request Yes , nightingales answer daws
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady
Be not afraid of greatness . Twas well writ .
What meanest thou by that , Malvolio
Some are born great
No if I mistake In those foundations which I build upon , The centre is not big enough to bear A school boy’s top . Away with her to prison He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty But that he speaks .
There’s some ill planet reigns I must be patient till the heavens look With an aspect more favourable . Good my lords , I am not prone to weeping , as our sex Commonly are the want of which vain dew Perchance shall dry your pities but I have That honourable grief lodged here which burns Worse than tears drown beseech you all , my lords , With thoughts so qualified as your charities Shall best instruct you , measure me and so The king’s will be perform’d
Shall I be heard
Who is’t that goes with me Beseech your highness , My women may be with me for you see My plight requires it . Do not weep , good fools There is no cause when you shall know your mistress Has deserved prison , then abound in tears As I come out this action I now go on Is for my better grace . Adieu , my lord I never wish’d to see you sorry now I trust I shall . My women , come you have leave .
Then never trust me if I be afeard .
You are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense I mean , Hortensio is afeard of you .
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round .
Roundly replied .
Mistress , how mean you that
Thus I conceive by him .
Conceives by me How likes Hortensio that
My widow says , thus she conceives her tale . That’s what I understand him to mean .
Very well mended . Kiss him for that , good widow .
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round I pray you , tell me what you meant by that .
Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe . And now you know my meaning .
A very mean meaning .
Right , I mean you .
And I am mean indeed , respecting you .
Demand me nothing . What you know , you know . From this time forth I never will speak word .
What , not to pray
Torments will ope your lips .
Well , thou dost best .
Sir , you shall understand what hath befall n , Which , as I think , you know not . Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo , And here another . The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo .
Oh , villain
Most heathenish and most gross
Now here’s another discontented paper Found in his pocket too , and this , it seems , Roderigo meant to have sent this damnèd villain But that , belike , Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him .
O thou pernicious caitiff How came you , Cassio , by that handkerchief That was my wife’s
I found it in my chamber , And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire .
The weary sun hath made a golden set , And by the bright track of his fiery car , Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow . Sir William Brandon , you shall bear my standard . Give me some ink and paper in my tent I’ll draw the form and model of our battle , Limit each leader to his several charge , And part in just proportion our small power . My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , And you , Sir Walter Herbert , stay with me . The earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment Good Captain Blunt , bear my goodnight to him , And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent . Yet one thing more , good captain , do for me . Where is Lord Stanley quartered , do you know
Unless I have mista en his colors much , Which well I am assured I have not done , His regiment lies half a mile , at least , South from the mighty power of the king .
If without peril it be possible , Sweet Blunt , make some good means to speak with him , And give him from me this most needful note .
Upon my life , my lord , I’ll undertake it . And so God give you quiet rest tonight
To her , Kate
To her , widow
A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down .
That’s my office .
Spoke like an officer Ha to thee , lad
How likes Gremio these quick witted folks
Believe me , sir , they butt together well .
Head and butt An hasty witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn .
Ay , mistress bride , hath that awakened you
Ay , but not frighted me . Therefore I’ll sleep again .
Nay , that you shall not . Since you have begun , Have at you for a bitter jest or two
Am I your bird I mean to shift my bush , And then pursue me as you draw your bow . You are welcome all .
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company . The next , our ship Which , but three glasses since , we gave out split Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea .
Sir , all this service Have I done since I went .
My tricksy spirit
These are not natural events . They strengthen From strange to stranger . Say , how came you hither
If I did think , sir , I were well awake , I’d strive to tell you . We were dead of sleep And how , we know not all clapped under hatches , Where but even now with strange and several noises Of roaring , shrieking , howling , jingling chains , And more diversity of sounds , all horrible , We were awaked , straightway at liberty , Where we , in all her trim , freshly beheld Our royal , good , and gallant ship , our Master Capering to eye her . On a trice , so please you , Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither .
Was ’t well done
Bravely , my diligence . Thou shalt be free .
O fool fool fool
There is besides in Roderigo’s letter How he upbraids Iago , that he made him Brave me upon the watch , whereon it came That I was cast . And even but now he spake , After long seeming dead Iago hurt him , Iago set him on .
You must forsake this room and go with us . Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus . For this slave , If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long , It shall be his . You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state . Come , bring him away .
Soft you , a word or two before you go . I have done the state some service , and they know ’t . No more of that . I pray you , in your letters , When you shall these unlucky deeds relate , Speak of me as I am . Nothing extenuate , Nor set down aught in malice . Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely , but too well . Of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , Perplexed in the extreme . Of one whose hand , Like the base Indian , threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe . Of one whose subdued eyes , Albeit unused to the melting mood , Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum . Set you down this ,
All these are servants to deceitful men .
Base men that use them to so base effect But truer stars did govern Proteus’ birth His words are bonds , his oaths are oracles , His love sincere , his thoughts immaculate , His tears pure messengers sent from his heart , His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth .
Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him
Now , as thou lov’st me , do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth . Only deserve my love by loving him , And presently go with me to my chamber To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my longing journey . All that is mine I leave at thy dispose , My goods , my lands , my reputation Only , in lieu thereof , dispatch me hence . Come , answer not , but to it presently I am impatient of my tarriance .
Ha
Some achieve greatness
What sayest thou
And some have greatness thrust upon them .
Heaven restore thee
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings
Thy yellow stockings
And wished to see thee cross gartered .
Cross gartered
Go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so
Am I made
If not , let me see thee a servant still .
Why , this is very midsummer madness .
Madam , the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned . I could hardly entreat him back . He attends your ladyship’s pleasure .
She hath prevented me . Here , Signior Tranio , This bird you aimed at , though you hit her not . Therefore a health to all that shot and missed .
Oh , sir , Lucentio slipped me like his greyhound , Which runs himself and catches for his master .
A good swift simile , but something currish .
Tis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself . Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay .
Oh , Oh , Petruchio Tranio hits you now .
I thank thee for that gird , good Tranio .
Confess , confess , hath he not hit you here
He has a little galled me , I confess . And , as the jest did glance away from me , Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright .
Now , in good sadness , son Petruchio , I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all .
Well , I say no . And therefore , for assurance , Let’s each one send unto his wife And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her , Shall win the wager which we will propose .
Content . What’s the wager
Things for the cook , sir , but I know not what .
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .
Fetch drier logs . Call Peter . He will show thee where they are .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .
Mass , and well said . A merry whoreson , ha Thou shalt be loggerhead . Good faith , ’tis day . The county will be here with music straight , For so he said he would . I hear him near .
Nurse Wife What , ho What , Nurse , I say
Go waken Juliet . Go and trim her up . I’ll go and chat with Paris . Hie , make haste , Make haste . The bridegroom he is come already . Make haste , I say .
Go , do our bidding hence Exit HERMIONE , guarded with Ladies
Beseech your highness , call the queen again .
Be certain what you do , sir , lest your justice Prove violence in the which three great ones suffer , Yourself , your queen , your son .
For her , my lord , I dare my life lay down and will do’t , sir , Please you to accept it , that the queen is spotless I’ the eyes of heaven and to you I mean , In this which you accuse her .
If it prove She’s otherwise , I’ll keep my stables where I lodge my wife I’ll go in couples with her Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her For every inch of woman in the world , Ay , every dram of woman’s flesh is false , If she be .
Hold your peaces .
Good my lord ,
It is for you we speak , not for ourselves You are abused and by some putter on That will be damn’d for’t would I knew the villain , I would land damn him . Be she honour flaw’d , I have three daughters the eldest is eleven The second and the third , nine , and some five If this prove true , they’ll pay for’t by mine honour , I’ll geld ’em all fourteen they shall not see , To bring false generations they are co heirs And I had rather glib myself than they Should not produce fair issue .
And say besides that in Aleppo once , Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state , I took by the throat the circumcisèd dog , And smote him , thus .
Oh , bloody period
All that is spoke is marred .
I kissed thee ere I killed thee . No way but this , Killing myself , to die upon a kiss .
This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon , For he was great of heart .
O Spartan dog , More fell than anguish , hunger , or the sea , Look on the tragic loading of this bed . This is thy work . The object poisons sight , Let it be hid . Gratiano , keep the house And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor , For they succeed on you . To you , lord governor , Remains the censure of this hellish villain The time , the place , the torture . Oh , enforce it Myself will straight aboard , and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate .
Good night , good Captain Blunt .
Come , gentlemen , Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business Into my tent . The dew is raw and cold .
What is t o clock
It’s suppertime , my lord . It’s nine o clock .
I will not sup tonight . Give me some ink and paper . What , is my beaver easier than it was And all my armor laid into my tent
It is , my liege , and all things are in readiness .
Good Norfolk , hie thee to thy charge . Use careful watch . Choose trusty sentinels .
I go , my lord .
Stir with the lark tomorrow , gentle Norfolk .
I warrant you , my lord .
Catesby .
Twenty crowns .
Twenty crowns I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife .
A hundred then .
Content .
A match Tis done .
Who shall begin
That will I . Go , Biondello , bid your mistress come to me .
I go .
Son , I’ll be your half Bianca comes .
I’ll have no halves . I’ll bear it all myself .
How now , what news
Sir , my mistress sends you word That she is busy , and she cannot come .
How She’s busy , and she cannot come Is that an answer
Sir Thurio , give us leave , I pray , awhile . We have some secrets to confer about .
Now tell me , Proteus , what’s your will with me
My gracious lord , that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal But when I call to mind your gracious favors Done to me , undeserving as I am , My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me . Know , worthy prince , Sir Valentine , my friend , This night intends to steal away your daughter . Myself am one made privy to the plot . I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio , whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stolen away from you , It would be much vexation to your age . Thus , for my duty’s sake , I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than , by concealing it , heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down , Being unprevented , to your timeless grave .
I’ll come to him .
Good Maria , let this fellow be looked to . Where’s my cousin Toby Let some of my people have a special care of him . I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
Oh , ho Do you come near me now No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me . This concurs directly with the letter . She sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him , for she incites me to that in the letter . Cast thy humble slough , says she . Be opposite with a kinsman , surly with servants . Let thy tongue tang with arguments of state . Put thyself into the trick of singularity , and consequently sets down the manner how as , a sad face , a reverend carriage , a slow tongue , in the habit of some sir of note , and so forth . I have limed her , but it is Jove’s doing , and Jove make me thankful And when she went away now , Let this fellow be looked to . Fellow Not Malvolio , nor after my degree , but fellow . Why , everything adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance what can be said Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes . Well , Jove , not I , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
This is as strange a maze as e er men trod , And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of . Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge .
Sir , my liege , Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business . At picked leisure Which shall be shortly , single I’ll resolve you Which to you shall seem probable of every These happened accidents . Till when , be cheerful And think of each thing well . Come hither , spirit . Set Caliban and his companions free . Untie the spell .
How fares my gracious sir There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not .
Every man shift for all the rest and let no man take care for himself , for all is but fortune . Coraggio , bully monster , coraggio
If these be true spies which I wear in my head , here’s a goodly sight .
O Setebos , these be brave spirits indeed How fine my master is I am afraid He will chastise me .
Mistress What , mistress Juliet Fast , I warrant her , she . Why , lamb Why , lady Fie , you slug a bed . Why , love , I say . Madam Sweet heart Why , bride What , not a word You take your pennyworths now . Sleep for a week , for the next night , I warrant , The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little . God forgive me , Marry , and amen . How sound is she asleep I must needs wake her . Madam , madam , madam Ay , let the county take you in your bed . He’ll fright you up , i faith . Will it not be What , dressed and in your clothes , and down again I must needs wake you . Lady , lady , lady Alas , alas Help , help My lady’s dead Oh , welladay , that ever I was born Some aqua vitae , ho My lord My lady
What noise is here
O lamentable day
What is the matter
Look , look . O heavy day
Ay , and a kind one too . Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
I hope better .
Sirrah Biondello , go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith .
O , ho , entreat her Nay , then she must needs come .
I am afraid , sir , Do what you can , yours will not be entreated .
Now , where’s my wife
She says you have some goodly jest in hand . She will not come . She bids you come to her .
Worse and worse . She will not come O vile , intolerable , not to be endured Sirrah Grumio , go to your mistress , Say I command her to come to me .
I know her answer .
What
She will not .
From fairest creatures we desire increase , That thereby beauty’s rose might never die , But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory . But thou , contracted to thine own bright eyes , Feed’st thy light’s flame with self substantial fuel , Making a famine where abundance lies , Thyself thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel . Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring , Within thine own bud buriest thy content , And , tender churl , mak’st waste in niggarding . Pity the world , or else this glutton be , To eat the world’s due , by the grave and thee .
Cease no more . You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man’s nose but I do see’t and feel’t As you feel doing thus and see withal The instruments that feel .
If it be so , We need no grave to bury honesty There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten Of the whole dungy earth .
What lack I credit
I had rather you did lack than I , my lord , Upon this ground and more it would content me To have her honour true than your suspicion , Be blamed for’t how you might .
Why , what need we Commune with you of this , but rather follow Our forceful instigation Our prerogative Calls not your counsels , but our natural goodness Imparts this which if you , or stupefied Or seeming so in skill , cannot or will not Relish a truth like us , inform yourselves We need no more of your advice the matter , The loss , the gain , the ordering on’t , is all Properly ours .
My lord .
Send out a pursuivant at arms To Stanley’s regiment . Bid him bring his power Before sunrising , lest his son George fall Into the blind cave of eternal night .
Fill me a bowl of wine . Give me a watch . Saddle white Surrey for the field to morrow . Look that my staves be sound , and not too heavy . Ratcliffe .
My lord .
Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland
Thomas the earl of Surrey and himself , Much about cockshut time , from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers .
So , I am satisfied . Give me a bowl of wine . I have not that alacrity of spirit Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have . Set it down . Is ink and paper ready
It is , my lord .
Bid my guard watch . Leave me . Ratcliffe , about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me . Leave me , I say .
The fouler fortune mine , and there an end .
Now , by my holidam , here comes Katherina
What is your will , sir , that you send for me
Where is your sister , and Hortensio’s wife
They sit conferring by the parlor fire .
Go fetch them hither . If they deny to come , Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands . Away , I say , and bring them hither straight .
Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
And so it is . I wonder what it bodes .
Marry , peace it bodes , and love , and quiet life , And awful rule , and right supremacy , And , to be short , what not that’s sweet and happy
Now , fair befall thee , good Petruchio The wager thou hast won , and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , Another dowry to another daughter , For she is changed as she had never been .
Which way is he , in the name of sanctity If all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and Legion himself possessed him , yet I’ll speak to him .
Here he is , here he is . How is’t with you , sir How is’t with you , man
Go off , I discard you . Let me enjoy my private . Go off .
Lo , how hollow the fiend speaks within him Did not I tell you Sir Toby , my lady prays you to have a care of him .
Aha Does she so
Go to , go to Peace , peace . We must deal gently with him . Let me alone . How do you , Malvolio How is ’t with you What , man , defy the devil Consider , he’s an enemy to mankind .
Do you know what you say
La you , an you speak ill of the devil , how he takes it at heart Pray God , he be not bewitched
Carry his water to the wisewoman .
Marry , and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live . My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say .
Proteus , I thank thee for thine honest care , Which to requite , command me while I live . This love of theirs myself have often seen , Haply when they have judged me fast asleep , And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court . But , fearing lest my jealous aim might err , And so , unworthily , disgrace the man A rashness that I ever yet have shunned I gave him gentle looks , thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me . And , that thou mayst perceive my fear of this , Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested , I nightly lodge her in an upper tower , The key whereof myself have ever kept And thence she cannot be conveyed away .
How now , mistress
Know , noble lord , they have devised a means How he her chamber window will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down For which the youthful lover now is gone , And this way comes he with it presently , Where , if it please you , you may intercept him . But , good my lord , do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimèd at For , love of you , not hate unto my friend , Hath made me publisher of this pretence .
O me , O me My child , my only life , Revive , look up , or I will die with thee Help , help Call help .
For shame , bring Juliet forth . Her lord is come .
She’s dead , deceased , she’s dead . Alack the day
Alack the day . She’s dead , she’s dead , she’s dead
Ha Let me see her . Out , alas She’s cold . Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff . Life and these lips have long been separated . Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
O lamentable day
O woeful time .
Death , that hath ta en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field , Thy youth’s proud livery , so gazed on now , Will be a tattered weed , of small worth held . Then being asked where all thy beauty lies , Where all the treasure of thy lusty days , To say within thine own deep sunken eyes Were an all eating shame and thriftless praise . How much more praise deserved thy beauty’s use If thou couldst answer , This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse , Proving his beauty by succession thine . This were to be new made when thou art old , And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold .
Ha , ha What things are these , my lord Antonio Will money buy em
Very like . One of them Is a plain fish , and no doubt marketable .
Mark but the badges of these men , my lords , Then say if they be true . This misshapen knave , His mother was a witch , and one so strong That could control the moon , make flows and ebbs , And deal in her command without her power . These three have robbed me , and this demi devil For he’s a bastard one had plotted with them To take my life . Two of these fellows you Must know and own . This thing of darkness I Acknowledge mine .
I shall be pinched to death .
Is not this Stephano , my drunken butler
He is drunk now . Where had he wine
And Trinculo is reeling ripe . Where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded em How camest thou in this pickle
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that , I fear me , will never out of my bones . I shall not fear flyblowing .
Why , how now , Stephano
Come , is the bride ready to go to church
Ready to go , but never to return . O son The night before thy wedding day Hath death lain with thy wife . There she lies , Flower as she was , deflowered by him .
Nay , I will win my wager better yet , And show more sign of her obedience , Her new built virtue and obedience .
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion . Katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not . Off with that bauble , throw it underfoot .
Lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , Till I be brought to such a silly pass
Fie What a foolish duty call you this
I would your duty were as foolish too . The wisdom of your duty , fair Bianca , Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime .
The more fool you for laying on my duty .
Katherine , I charge thee , tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands .
Come , come , you’re mocking . We will have no telling .
Come on , I say , and first begin with her .
She shall not .
I say she shall . And first begin with her .
And I wish , my liege , You had only in your silent judgment tried it , Without more overture .
How could that be Either thou art most ignorant by age , Or thou wert born a fool . Camillo’s flight , Added to their familiarity , Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture , That lack’d sight only , nought for approbation But only seeing , all other circumstances Made up to the deed , doth push on this proceeding Yet , for a greater confirmation , For in an act of this importance ’twere Most piteous to be wild , I have dispatch’d in post To sacred Delphos , to Apollo’s temple , Cleomenes and Dion , whom you know Of stuff’d sufficiency now from the oracle They will bring all whose spiritual counsel had , Shall stop or spur me . Have I done well
Well done , my lord .
Though I am satisfied and need no more Than what I know , yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others , such as he Whose ignorant credulity will not Come up to the truth . So have we thought it good From our free person she should be confined , Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform . Come , follow us We are to speak in public for this business Will raise us all .
Death is my son in law . Death is my heir . My daughter he hath wedded . I will die , And leave him all . Life , living , all is Death’s .
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest , Now is the time that face should form another , Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest , Thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother . For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his self love , to stop posterity Thou art thy mother’s glass , and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime So thou through windows of thine age shalt see , Despite of wrinkles , this thy golden time . But if thou live remembered not to be , Die single and thine image dies with thee .
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face , And doth it give me such a sight as this
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day Most miserable hour that e er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage . But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight
O woe O woeful , woeful , woeful day Most lamentable day , most woeful day That ever , ever , I did yet behold O day , O day , O day , O hateful day Never was seen so black a day as this . O woeful day , O woeful day
Beguiled , divorcèd , wrongèd , spited , slain Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown O love O life Not life , but love in death .
Despised , distressèd , hated , martyred , killed Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity O child , O child My soul , and not my child Dead art thou Alack , my child is dead , And with my child my joys are buried .
Peace , ho , for shame Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions . Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid . Now heaven hath all ,
Fie , fie Unknit that threat ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor . It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads , Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds , And in no sense is meet or amiable . A woman moved is like a fountain troubled , Muddy , ill seeming , thick , bereft of beauty , And while it is so , none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it . Thy husband is thy lord , thy life , thy keeper , Thy head , thy sovereign , one that cares for thee , And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labor both by sea and land , To watch the night in storms , the day in cold , Whilst thou liest warm at home , secure and safe , And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love , fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt . Such duty as the subject owes the prince , Even such a woman oweth to her husband . And when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , And not obedient to his honest will , What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule , supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve , love , and obey . Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , Unapt to toil and trouble in the world , But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come , come , you froward and unable worms
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm
All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person , noble father in law . Tell me , how fares our loving mother
I , by attorney , bless thee from thy mother , Who prays continually for Richmond’s good . So much for that . The silent hours steal on , And flaky darkness breaks within the east . In brief , for so the season bids us be , Prepare thy battle early in the morning , And put thy fortune to the arbitrament Of bloody strokes and mortal staring war . I , as I may that which I would I cannot , With best advantage will deceive the time , And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms . But on thy side I may not be too forward , Lest , being seen , thy brother , tender George , Be executed in his father’s sight . Farewell . The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse , Which so long sundered friends should dwell upon . God give us leisure for these rites of love Once more , adieu . Be valiant , and speed well .
Good lords , conduct him to his regiment I’ll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap , Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow , When I should mount with wings of victory . Once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
Upon mine honor , he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this .
Adieu , my lord . Sir Valentine is coming .
Sir Valentine , whither away so fast
Please it your Grace , there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends , And I am going to deliver them .
Be they of much import
The tenor of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court .
Nay then , no matter . Stay with me awhile . I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near , wherein thou must be secret . ’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter .
I know it well , my lord , and sure the match Were rich and honorable . Besides , the gentleman Is full of virtue , bounty , worth , and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter . Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him
No , trust me . She is peevish , sullen , froward , Proud , disobedient , stubborn , lacking duty , Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father . And , may I say to thee , this pride of hers , Upon advice , hath drawn my love from her And , where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherished by her childlike duty , I now am full resolved to take a wife , And turn her out to who will take her in . Then let her beauty be her wedding dower , For me and my possessions she esteems not .
O Lord
Prithee , hold thy peace . This is not the way . Do you not see you move him Let me alone with him .
No way but gentleness , gently , gently . The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used .
Why , how now , my bawcock How dost thou , chuck
Sir
Ay , Biddy , come with me . What , man Tis not for gravity to play at cherry pit with Satan . Hang him , foul collier
Get him to say his prayers , good Sir Toby , get him to pray .
My prayers , minx
No , I warrant you , he will not hear of godliness .
Go , hang yourselves all You are idle , shallow things . I am not of your element . You shall know more hereafter .
Unthrifty loveliness , why dost thou spend Upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy Nature’s bequest gives nothing , but doth lend , And , being frank , she lends to those are free . Then , beauteous niggard , why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give Profitless usurer , why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live For having traffic with thyself alone , Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive . Then how when nature calls thee to be gone , What acceptable audit canst thou leave Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee , Which usèd lives th executor to be .
And all the better is it for the maid . Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life . The most you sought was her promotion , For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced . And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well . She’s not well married that lives married long , But she’s best married that dies married young . Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corse , and , as the custom is , And in her best array , bear her to church . For though some nature bids us all lament , Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment .
All things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral . Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast . Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .
Sir , go you in , and , madam , go with him And go , Sir Paris . Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave . The heavens do lour upon you for some ill . Move them no more by crossing their high will .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
O , touch me not . I am not Stephano , but a cramp .
You’d be king o th isle , sirrah
I should have been a sore one then .
This is a strange thing as e er I looked on .
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape . Go , sirrah , to my cell . Take with you your companions . As you look To have my pardon , trim it handsomely .
Ay , that I will . And I’ll be wise hereafter And seek for grace . What a thrice double ass Was I , to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool
Go to , away .
Hence , and bestow your luggage where you found it .
Or stole it , rather .
Sir , I invite your highness and your train To my poor cell , where you shall take your rest For this one night , which part of it I’ll waste With such discourse as , I not doubt , shall make it Go quick away the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle . And in the morn I’ll bring you to your ship and so to Naples , Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear belovèd solemnized , And thence retire me to my Milan , where Every third thought shall be my grave .
My mind hath been as big as one of yours , My heart as great , my reason haply more , To bandy word for word and frown for frown . But now I see our lances are but straws , Our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , That seeming to be most which we indeed least are . Then vail your stomachs , for it is no boot , And place your hands below your husband’s foot In token of which duty , if he please , My hand is ready , may it do him ease .
Why , there’s a wench Come on and kiss me , Kate .
Well , go thy ways , old lad , for thou shalt ha ’t .
Tis a good hearing when children are toward .
But a harsh hearing when women are froward .
Come , Kate , we’ll to bed . We three are married , but you two are sped . Twas I won the wager , though you hit the white , And , being a winner , God give you good night
Now , go thy ways , thou hast tamed a curst shrew .
Tis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
To laughter , as I take it , If the good truth were known .
Honest good fellows , ah , put up , put up , For , well you know , this is a pitiful case .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Musicians , O musicians , Heart’s Ease , Heart’s Ease . O , an you will have me live , play Heart’s Ease .
Why Heart’s ease
O musicians , because my heart itself plays My Heart is Full . O , play me some merry dump to comfort me .
Not a dump , we . Tis no time to play now .
You will not then
No .
I will then give it you soundly .
What will you give us
No money , on my faith , but the gleek . I will give you the minstrel .
Then I will give you the serving creature .
Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel . For never resting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there , Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone , Beauty o er snowed and bareness everywhere . Then were not summer’s distillation left , A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass , Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft , Nor it nor no remembrance what it was . But flowers distilled , though they with winter meet , Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet .
O Thou , whose captain I account myself , Look on my forces with a gracious eye . Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath , That they may crush down with a heavy fall The usurping helmets of our adversaries Make us thy ministers of chastisement , That we may praise thee in the victory To thee I do commend my watchful soul , Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes . Sleeping and waking , O , defend me still Sleeps
Be cheerful , Richmond , for the wrongèd souls Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf . King Henry’s issue , Richmond , comforts thee .
Virtuous and holy , be thou conqueror . Harry , that prophesied thou shouldst be king , Doth comfort thee in thy sleep . Live and flourish .
What would your Grace have me to do in this
There is a lady in Verona here Whom I affect , but she is nice and coy , And naught esteems my agèd eloquence . Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor For long agone I have forgot to court Besides , the fashion of the time is changed How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sun bright eye .
Win her with gifts , if she respect not words . Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a woman’s mind .
But she did scorn a present that I sent her .
A woman sometime scorns what best contents her . Send her another . Never give her o’er , For scorn at first makes after love the more . If she do frown , ’tis not in hate of you , But rather to beget more love in you . If she do chide , ’tis not to have you gone , Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone . Take no repulse , whatever she doth say For Get you gone , she doth not mean Away ’ Flatter and praise , commend , extol their graces Though ne’er so black , say they have angels’ faces . That man that hath a tongue , I say , is no man If with his tongue he cannot win a woman .
I long To hear the story of your life , which must Take the ear strangely .
I’ll deliver all , And promise you calm seas , auspicious gales , And sail so expeditious that shall catch Your royal fleet far off . My Ariel , chick , That is thy charge . Then to the elements Be free , and fare thou well Please you , draw near .
Is ’t possible
If this were played upon a stage now , I could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
Nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
Why , we shall make him mad indeed .
The house will be the quieter .
Come , we’ll have him in a dark room and bound . My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad . We may carry it thus , for our pleasure and his penance , till our very pastime , tired out of breath , prompt us to have mercy on him , at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen . But see , but see
More matter for a May morning .
Here’s the challenge , read it . Warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t .
Is ’t so saucy
Ay , is ’t , I warrant him . Do but read .
The keeper of the prison , call to him let him have knowledge who I am .
Good lady , No court in Europe is too good for thee What dost thou then in prison
Now , good sir , You know me , do you not
For a worthy lady And one whom much I honour .
Pray you then , Conduct me to the queen .
I may not , madam To the contrary I have express commandment .
Here’s ado , To lock up honesty and honour from The access of gentle visitors Is’t lawful , pray you , To see her women any of them Emilia
So please you , madam , To put apart these your attendants , I Shall bring Emilia forth .
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface In thee thy summer , ere thou be distilled . Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place With beauty’s treasure , ere it be self killed . That use is not forbidden usury Which happies those that pay the willing loan That’s for thyself to breed another thee , Or ten times happier , be it ten for one . Ten times thyself were happier than thou art , If ten of thine ten times refigured thee . Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart , Leaving thee living in posterity Be not self willed , for thou art much too fair To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir .
But she I mean is promised by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth , And kept severely from resort of men , That no man hath access by day to her .
Why then I would resort to her by night .
Ay , but the doors be locked and keys kept safe , That no man hath recourse to her by night .
What lets but one may enter at her window
Her chamber is aloft , far from the ground , And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his life .
Why then , a ladder quaintly made of cords To cast up , with a pair of anchoring hooks , Would serve to scale another Hero’s tower , So bold Leander would adventure it .
Now , as thou art a gentleman of blood , Advise me where I may have such a ladder .
When would you use it Pray , sir , tell me that .
This very night for Love is like a child , That longs for everything that he can come by .
Then will I lay the serving creature’s dagger on your pate . I will carry no crotchets . I’ll re you , I’ll fa you . Do you note me
By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder .
An you re us and fa us , you note us .
But , hark thee , I will go to her alone How shall I best convey the ladder thither
Pray you , put up your dagger and put out your wit .
Then have at you with my wit . I will dry beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger . Answer me like men .
When griping grief the heart doth wound And doleful dumps the mind oppress , Then music with her silver sound
Why silver sound Why music with her silver sound What say you , Simon Catling
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
Prates . What say you , Hugh Rebeck
I say , silver sound because musicians sound for silver .
Prates too . What say you , James Soundpost
Faith , I know not what to say .
Now my charms are all o erthrown , And what strength I have’s mine own , Which is most faint . Now , ’tis true , I must be here confined by you , Or sent to Naples . Let me not , Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver , dwell In this bare island by your spell , But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands . Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill , or else my project fails , Which was to please . Now I want Spirits to enforce , art to enchant , And my ending is despair , Unless I be relieved by prayer , Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults . As you from crimes would pardoned be , Let your indulgence set me free .
Give me . Youth , whatsoever thou art , thou art but a scurvy fellow .
Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster , The wrongèd heirs of York do pray for thee Good angels guard thy battle . Live and flourish .
Good , and valiant .
Lo , in the Orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head , each under eye Doth homage to his new appearing sight , Serving with looks his sacred majesty And having climbed the steep up heavenly hill , Resembling strong youth in his middle age , Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still , Attending on his golden pilgrimage . But when from highmost pitch , with weary car , Like feeble age he reeleth from the day , The eyes , fore duteous , now converted are From his low tract and look another way . So thou , thyself out going in thy noon , Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son .
Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow , Rivers , that died at Pomfret . Despair , and die
Think upon Grey , and let thy soul despair
Think upon Vaughan , and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance . Despair , and die
Awake , and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom Will conquer him Awake , and win the day .
Wonder not , nor admire not in thy mind , why I do call thee so , for I will show thee no reason for ’t .
A good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
Thou comest to the lady Olivia , and in my sight she uses thee kindly . But thou liest in thy throat . That is not the matter I challenge thee for .
Very brief , and to exceeding good sense less .
I will waylay thee going home , where if it be thy chance to kill me
Good .
Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain .
Still you keep o the windy side of the law . Good .
Fare thee well , and God have mercy upon one of our souls . He may have mercy upon mine , but my hope is better , and so look to thyself . Thy friend , as thou usest him , and thy sworn enemy , Andrew Aguecheek
I pray now , call her . Withdraw yourselves .
And , madam , I must be present at your conference .
Well , be’t so , prithee .
Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain As passes colouring .
Dear gentlewoman , How fares our gracious lady
As well as one so great and so forlorn May hold together on her frights and griefs , Which never tender lady hath born greater , She is something before her time deliver’d .
A boy
A daughter , and a goodly babe , Lusty and like to live the queen receives Much comfort in’t says ‘My poor prisoner , I am innocent as you . ’
I dare be sworn These dangerous unsafe lunes i’ the king , beshrew them He must be told on’t , and he shall the office Becomes a woman best I’ll take’t upon me If I prove honey mouth’d let my tongue blister And never to my red look’d anger be The trumpet any more . Pray you , Emilia , Commend my best obedience to the queen If she dares trust me with her little babe , I’ll show’t the king and undertake to be Her advocate to the loud’st . We do not know How he may soften at the sight o’ the child The silence often of pure innocence Persuades when speaking fails .
It will be light , my lord , that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length .
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
Ay , my good lord .
Then let me see thy cloak . I’ll get me one of such another length .
Why , any cloak will serve the turn , my lord .
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak I pray thee , let me feel thy cloak upon me .
What letter is this same What’s here To Sylvia And here an engine fit for my proceeding . I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once .
My thoughts do harbor with my Sylvia nightly , And slaves they are to me , that send them flying . O , could their master come and go as lightly , Himself would lodge where , senseless , they are lying My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them , While I , their king , that thither them importune , Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them , Because myself do want my servants’ fortune . I curse myself , for they are sent by me , That they should harbor where their lord should be . What’s here Sylvia , this night I will enfranchise thee . ’Tis so and here’s the ladder for the purpose . Why , Phaëthon , for thou art Merops’ son Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car And with thy daring folly burn the world Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee Go , base intruder , overweening slave Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates , And think my patience , more than thy desert , Is privilege for thy departure hence . Thank me for this more than for all the favors Which , all too much , I have bestowed on thee . But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court , By heaven , my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself . Begone I will not hear thy vain excuse , But , as thou lov’st thy life , make speed from hence .
Oh , I cry you mercy , you are the singer . I will say for you . It is music with her silver sound because musicians have no gold for sounding .
Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress .
What a pestilent knave is this same
Hang him , Jack Come , we’ll in here , tarry for the mourners and stay dinner .
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand . My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne , And all this day an unaccustomed spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . I dreamt my lady came and found me dead Strange dream , that gives a dead man leave to think And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor . Ah me How sweet is love itself possessed When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy
News from Verona How now , Balthasar Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar How doth my lady Is my father well How fares my Juliet That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill . Her body sleeps in Capels monument , And her immortal part with angels lives . I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you . O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
And why not death rather than living torment To die is to be banished from myself , And Sylvia is myself . Banished from her Is self from self a deadly banishment What light is light , if Sylvia be not seen What joy is joy , if Sylvia be not by Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection . Except I be by Sylvia in the night , There is no music in the nightingale Unless I look on Sylvia in the day , There is no day for me to look upon . She is my essence , and I leave to be If I be not by her fair influence Fostered , illumined , cherished , kept alive . I fly not death , to fly his deadly doom Tarry I here , I but attend on death , But , fly I hence , I fly away from life .
Run , boy , run , run , and seek him out .
So ho , so ho
What seest thou
Most worthy madam , Your honour and your goodness is so evident That your free undertaking cannot miss A thriving issue there is no lady living So meet for this great errand . Please your ladyship To visit the next room , I’ll presently Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer Who but to day hammer’d of this design , But durst not tempt a minister of honour , Lest she should be denied .
Tell her , Emilia . I’ll use that tongue I have if wit flow from’t As boldness from my bosom , let ’t not be doubted I shall do good .
Now be you blest for it I’ll to the queen please you , come something nearer .
Madam , if’t please the queen to send the babe , I know not what I shall incur to pass it , Having no warrant .
You need not fear it , sir This child was prisoner to the womb and is By law and process of great nature thence Freed and enfranchised , not a party to The anger of the king nor guilty of , If any be , the trespass of the queen .
Him we go to find . There’s not a hair on ’s head but ’tis a Valentine .
Valentine
Is it e en so Then I defy you , stars Thou know’st my lodging . Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses . I will hence tonight .
No .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience . Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
Who then His spirit
Tush , thou art deceived . Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do . Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
Neither .
What then
No , my good lord .
Nothing .
No matter . Get thee gone , And hire those horses . I’ll be with thee straight .
Can nothing speak Master , shall I strike
Who wouldst thou strike
Nothing .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight . Let’s see for means . O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men I do remember an apothecary And hereabouts he dwells which late I noted In tattered weeds , with overwhelming brows , Culling of simples . Meager were his looks , Sharp misery had worn him to the bones , And in his needy shop a tortoise hung , An alligator stuffed , and other skins Of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes , Green earthen pots , bladders and musty seeds , Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses , Were thinly scattered to make up a show .
Villain , forbear .
Why , sir , I’ll strike nothing . I pray you
Sirrah , I say , forbear . Friend Valentine , a word .
My ears are stopped and cannot hear good news , So much of bad already hath possessed them .
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine , For they are harsh , untuneable , and bad .
Is Sylvia dead
No , Valentine .
No Valentine , indeed , for sacred Sylvia . Hath she forsworn me
No , Valentine .
No Valentine , if Sylvia have forsworn me . What is your news
If this letter move him not , his legs cannot . I’ll give ’t him .
You may have very fit occasion for ’t . He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart .
Go , Sir Andrew . Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum baily . So soon as ever thou seest him , draw , and as thou drawest , swear horrible , for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath , with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off , gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him . Away
Nay , let me alone for swearing .
Now will not I deliver his letter , for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding . His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less . Therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth . He will find it comes from a clodpole . But , sir , I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor , and drive the gentleman into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury , and impetuosity . This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
Sleep , Richmond , sleep in peace and wake in joy . Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy . Live , and beget a happy race of kings . Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .
Quiet , untroubled soul , awake , awake . Arm , fight , and conquer for fair England’s sake .
Thou quiet soul , sleep thou a quiet sleep . Dream of success and happy victory . Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee .
Music to hear , why hear’st thou music sadly Sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy . Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly , Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy If the true concord of well tuned sounds , By unions married , do offend thine ear , They do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear . Mark how one string , sweet husband to another , Strikes each in each by mutual ordering , Resembling sire and child and happy mother , Who all in one , one pleasing note do sing Whose speechless song , being many , seeming one , Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none .
Noting this penury , to myself I said , An if a man did need a poison now Whose sale is present death in Mantua Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him . Oh , this same thought did but forerun my need , And this same needy man must sell it me . As I remember , this should be the house . Being holiday , the beggar’s shop is shut . What , ho Apothecary
Who calls so loud
Come hither , man . I see that thou art poor . Hold , there is forty ducats . Let me have A dram of poison , such soon speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life weary taker may fall dead , And that the trunk may be discharged of breath As violently as hasty powder fired Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb .
Such mortal drugs I have , but Mantua’s law Is death to any he that utters them .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear’st to die Famine is in thy cheeks . Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes . Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back . The world is not thy friend nor the world’s law . The world affords no law to make thee rich . Then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
I do believe it .
Do not you fear upon mine honour , I will stand betwixt you and danger .
Sir , there is a proclamation that you are vanished .
That thou art banished O , that’s the news From hence , from Sylvia , and from me thy friend .
O , I have fed upon this woe already , And now excess of it will make me surfeit . Doth Sylvia know that I am banished
I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid , But cheer thy heart , and be thou not dismayed . God and good angels fight on Richmond’s side , And Richard fall in height of all his pride .
Give me another horse Bind up my wounds Have mercy , Jesu Soft , I did but dream . O coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me The lights burn blue . It is now dead midnight . Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh . What do I fear Myself There’s none else by . Richard loves Richard that is , I and I . Is there a murderer here No . Yes , I am . Then fly What , from myself Great reason why Lest I revenge . What , myself upon myself Alack , I love myself . Wherefore For any good That I myself have done unto myself O , no Alas , I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself . I am a villain . Yet I lie . I am not . Fool , of thyself speak well . Fool , do not flatter .
Ay , ay and she hath offered to the doom Which , unreversed , stands in effectual force A sea of melting pearl , which some call tears . Those at her father’s churlish feet she tendered With them , upon her knees , her humble self , Wringing her hands , whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe . But neither bended knees , pure hands held up , Sad sighs , deep groans , nor silver shedding tears Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire , But Valentine , if he be ta’en , must die . Besides , her intercession chafed him so , When she for thy repeal was suppliant , That to close prison he commanded her , With many bitter threats of biding there .
No more , unless the next word that thou speak’st Have some malignant power upon my life If so , I pray thee , breathe it in mine ear , As ending anthem of my endless dolor .
Here he comes with your niece . Give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
I have said too much unto a heart of stone And laid mine honor too unchary on ’t . There’s something in me that reproves my fault , But such a headstrong potent fault it is That it but mocks reproof .
With the same havior that your passion bears Goes on my master’s grief .
Here , wear this jewel for me . Tis my picture . Refuse it not . It hath no tongue to vex you . And I beseech you come again tomorrow . What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny , That honor , saved , may upon asking give
Nothing but this your true love for my master .
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you
I will acquit you .
Well , come again tomorrow . Fare thee well . A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
My poverty , but not my will , consents .
I pay thy poverty and not thy will .
Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off and , if you had the strength Of twenty men , it would dispatch you straight .
There is thy gold , worse poison to men’s souls , Doing more murder in this loathsome world , Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell . I sell thee poison . Thou hast sold me none . Farewell . Buy food , and get thyself in flesh . Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet’s grave , for there must I use thee .
Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye That thou consum’st thyself in single life Ah , if thou issueless shalt hap to die , The world will wail thee like a makeless wife The world will be thy widow and still weep , That thou no form of thee hast left behind , When every private widow well may keep , By children’s eyes , her husband’s shape in mind . Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end , And kept unused , the user so destroys it . No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murd rous shame commits .
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help , And study help for that which thou lament’st . Time is the nurse and breeder of all good . Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love Besides , thy staying will abridge thy life . Hope is a lover’s staff walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts . Thy letters may be here , though thou art hence , Which , being writ to me , shall be delivered Even in the milk white bosom of thy love . The time now serves not to expostulate . Come , I’ll convey thee through the city gate , And , ere I part with thee confer at large Of all that may concern thy love affairs . As thou lov’st Sylvia , though not for thyself , Regard thy danger , and along with me
I pray thee , Lance , an if thou seest my boy , Bid him make haste and meet me at the north gate .
Go , sirrah , find him out . Come , Valentine .
O my dear Sylvia Hapless Valentine
I am but a fool , look you , and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave . But that’s all one , if he be but one knave . He lives not now that knows me to be in love , yet I am in love . But a team of horse shall not pluck that from me , nor who ’tis I love . And yet ’tis a woman , but what woman , I will not tell myself . And yet ’tis a milkmaid . Yet ’tis not a maid , for she hath had gossips . Yet ’tis a maid , for she is her master’s maid , and serves for wages . She hath more qualities than a water spaniel , which is much in a bare Christian .
Holy Franciscan Friar Brother , ho
This same should be the voice of Friar John . Welcome from Mantua . What says Romeo Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
Gentleman , God save thee .
Nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness To bear the matter thus mere weakness . If The cause were not in being , part o’ the cause , She the adulteress for the harlot king Is quite beyond mine arm , out of the blank And level of my brain , plot proof but she I can hook to me say that she were gone , Given to the fire , a moiety of my rest Might come to me again . Who’s there
Going to find a barefoot brother out , One of our order , to associate me , Here in this city visiting the sick , And finding him , the searchers of the town , Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign , Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth . So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .
And you , sir .
My lord
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo
How does the boy
That defense thou hast , betake thee to ’t . Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , I know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the orchard end . Dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skillful and deadly .
He took good rest to night ’Tis hoped his sickness is discharged .
To see his nobleness Conceiving the dishonour of his mother , He straight declined , droop’d , took it deeply , Fasten’d and fix’d the shame on’t in himself , Threw off his spirit , his appetite , his sleep , And downright languish’d . Leave me solely go , See how he fares .
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues , And every tongue brings in a several tale , And every tale condemns me for a villain . Perjury , perjury , in the highest degree Murder , stern murder , in the direst degree All several sins , all used in each degree , Throng to the bar , crying all , Guilty guilty I shall despair . There is no creature loves me , And if I die no soul will pity me . And wherefore should they , since that I myself Find in myself no pity to myself Methought the souls of all that I had murdered Came to my tent , and every one did threat Tomorrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard .
My lord .
Zounds , who is there
Ratcliffe , my lord , ’tis I . The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn . Your friends are up and buckle on their armor .
O Ratcliffe , I have dreamed a fearful dream What think’st thou , will our friends prove all true
No doubt , my lord .
O Ratcliffe , I fear , I fear .
Nay , good my lord , be not afraid of shadows .
I could not send it here it is again Nor get a messenger to bring it thee , So fearful were they of infection .
Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood , The letter was not nice but full of charge , Of dear import , and the neglecting it May do much danger . Friar John , go hence . Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell .
You mistake , sir . I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me . My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man .
You’ll find it otherwise , I assure you . Therefore , if you hold your life at any price , betake you to your guard , for your opposite hath in him what youth , strength , skill , and wrath can furnish man withal .
I pray you , sir , what is he
He is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl . Souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre . Hob , nob , is his word . Give ’t or take ’t .
For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any , Who for thyself art so unprovident . Grant if thou wilt , thou art belov’d of many , But that thou none lov’st is most evident For thou art so possessed with murd rous hate That ‘gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire , Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire . O change thy thought , that I may change my mind . Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love Be as thy presence is , gracious and kind , Or to thyself at least kind hearted prove . Make thee another self for love of me , That beauty still may live in thine or thee .
Here is the catalog of her condition . Imprimis She can fetch and carry . Why , a horse can do no more . Nay , a horse cannot fetch , but only carry therefore is she better than a jade . Item She can milk . Look you , a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands .
How now , Signor Lance , what news with your mastership
With my master’s ship Why , it is at sea .
Well , your old vice still mistake the word . What news , then , in your paper
The black’st news that ever thou heardest .
Why , man , how black
Why , as black as ink .
Let me read them .
Fie on thee , jolt head Thou canst not read .
Thou liest . I can .
I will try thee . Tell me this who begot thee
Marry , the son of my grandfather .
O , illiterate loiterer It was the son of thy grandmother . This proves that thou canst not read .
Come , fool , come . Try me in thy paper .
There , and Saint Nicholas be thy speed
Imprimis , She can milk .
Ay , that she can .
Item She brews good ale .
And thereof comes the proverb Blessing of your heart , you brew good ale .
Item She can sew .
That’s as much as to say Can she so
Fie , fie no thought of him The thought of my revenges that way Recoil upon me in himself too mighty , And in his parties , his alliance let him be Until a time may serve for present vengeance , Take it on her . Camillo and Polixenes Laugh at me , make their pastime at my sorrow They should not laugh if I could reach them , nor Shall she within my power .
You must not enter .
Nay , rather , good my lords , be second to me Fear you his tyrannous passion more , alas , Than the queen’s life a gracious innocent soul , More free than he is jealous .
That’s enough .
Madam , he hath not slept tonight commanded None should come at him .
Not so hot , good sir I come to bring him sleep . ’Tis such as you , That creep like shadows by him and do sigh At each his needless heavings , such as you Nourish the cause of his awaking I Do come with words as medicinal as true , Honest as either , to purge him of that humour That presses him from sleep .
As fast as thou shalt wane , so fast thou grow’st In one of thine , from that which thou departest And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest . Herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase Without this , folly , age , and cold decay . If all were minded so , the times should cease , And threescore year would make the world away . Let those whom nature hath not made for store , Harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish . Look whom she best endowed , she gave the more , Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish . She carved thee for her seal , and meant thereby Thou shouldst print more , not let that copy die .
By the apostle Paul , shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond . Tis not yet near day . Come , go with me Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me .
Good morrow , Richmond .
Cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , That you have ta en a tardy sluggard here .
How have you slept , my lord
The sweetest sleep and fairest boding dreams That ever entered in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had , my lords . Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory . I promise you , my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream . How far into the morning is it , lords
Upon the stroke of four .
Why , then ’tis time to arm and give direction . His oration to his soldiers More than I have said , loving countrymen , The leisure and enforcement of the time Forbids to dwell upon . Yet remember this
Brother , I’ll go and bring it thee .
Now must I to the monument alone . Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake . She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents . But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come . Poor living corse , closed in a dead man’s tomb
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady . I am no fighter . I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valor . Belike this is a man of that quirk .
Sir , no . His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury . Therefore get you on and give him his desire . Back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him . Therefore on , or strip your sword stark naked , for meddle you must , that’s certain , or forswear to wear iron about you .
This is as uncivil as strange . I beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offense to him is . It is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
I will do so . Signior Fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
Pray you , sir , do you know of this matter
I know the knight is incensed against you , even to a mortal arbitrament , but nothing of the circumstance more .
I beseech you , what manner of man is he
Nothing of that wonderful promise , to read him by his form , as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor . He is , indeed , sir , the most skillful , bloody , and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria . Will you walk towards him I will make your peace with him if I can .
Item She can knit .
What need a man care for a stock with a wench , when she can knit him a stock
Item She can wash and scour .
A special virtue , for then she need not be washed and scoured .
Item She can spin .
Then may I set the world on wheels , when she can spin for her living .
What noise there , ho
Item She hath many nameless virtues .
No noise , my lord but needful conference About some gossips for your highness .
How Away with that audacious lady Antigonus , I charged thee that she should not come about me I knew she would .
I told her so , my lord , On your displeasure’s peril and on mine , She should not visit you .
What , canst not rule her
From all dishonesty he can in this , Unless he take the course that you have done , Commit me for committing honour , trust it , He shall not rule me .
La you now , you hear When she will take the rein I let her run But she’ll not stumble .
Good my liege , I come And , I beseech you , hear me , who profess Myself your loyal servant , your physician , Your most obedient counsellor , yet that dare Less appear so in comforting your evils , Than such as most seem yours I say , I come From your good queen .
Give me thy torch , boy . Hence , and stand aloof . Yet put it out , for I would not be seen . Under yon yew trees lay thee all along , Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread , Being loose , unfirm , with digging up of graves , But thou shalt hear it . Whistle then to me , As signal that thou hear’st something approach . Give me those flowers . Do as I bid thee , go .
I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard . Yet I will adventure .
Sweet flower , with flowers thy bridal bed I strew O woe Thy canopy is dust and stones Which with sweet water nightly I will dew . Or , wanting that , with tears distilled by moans , The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep .
The boy gives warning something doth approach . What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite What with a torch Muffle me , night , awhile .
That’s as much as to say , bastard virtues , that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names .
Here follow her vices .
Close at the heels of her virtues .
Item She is not to be kissed fasting , in respect of her breath .
Well , that fault may be mended with a breakfast . Read on .
Item She hath a sweet mouth .
That makes amends for her sour breath .
Item She doth talk in her sleep .
It’s no matter for that , so she sleep not in her talk .
Item She is slow in words .
O villain , that set this down among her vices To be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue . I pray thee , out with ’t , and place it for her chief virtue .
Item She is proud .
Out with that too it was Eve’s legacy , and cannot be ta’en from her .
Item She hath no teeth .
I care not for that neither , because I love crusts .
Item She is curst .
God and our good cause fight upon our side . The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls , Like high reared bulwarks , stand before our faces . Richard except , those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow . For what is he they follow Truly , gentlemen , A bloody tyrant and a homicide One raised in blood , and one in blood established One that made means to come by what he hath , And slaughtered those that were the means to help him A base foul stone , made precious by the foil Of England’s chair , where he is falsely set One that hath ever been God’s enemy . Then if you fight against God’s enemy , God will , in justice , ward you as his soldiers . If you do sweat to put a tyrant down , You sleep in peace , the tyrant being slain . If you do fight against your country’s foes , Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire . If you do fight in safeguard of your wives , Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors . If you do free your children from the sword , Your children’s children quits it in your age . Then , in the name of God and all these rights , Advance your standards . Draw your willing swords . For me , the ransom of my bold attempt Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face But if I thrive , the gain of my attempt The least of you shall share his part thereof . Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully God and Saint George Richmond and victory
When I do count the clock that tells the time , And see the brave day sunk in hideous night When I behold the violet past prime , And sable curls all silvered o er with white When lofty trees I see barren of leaves , Which erst from heat did canopy the herd , And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard Then of thy beauty do I question make , That thou among the wastes of time must go , Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see others grow , And nothing gainst Time’s scythe can make defense Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence .
I shall be much bound to you for ’t . I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight . I care not who knows so much of my mettle .
Why , man , he’s a very devil . I have not seen such a firago . I had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard , and all , and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable . And on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on . They say he has been fencer to the Sophy .
Pox on ’t I’ll not meddle with him .
Ay , but he will not now be pacified . Fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
Plague on ’t , an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him . Let him let the matter slip , and I’ll give him my horse , gray Capilet .
I’ll make the motion . Stand here , make a good show on ’t . This shall end without the perdition of souls . Marry , I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron . Upon thy life I charge thee , Whate er thou hear’st or seest , stand all aloof , And do not interrupt me in my course . Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady’s face , But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring , a ring that I must use In dear employment . Therefore hence , be gone . But if thou , jealous , dost return to pry In what I farther shall intend to do , By heaven , I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs . The time and my intents are savage , wild , More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
So shalt thou show me friendship . Take thou that . Live and be prosperous , and farewell , good fellow .
O that you were yourself But , love , you are No longer yours than you yourself here live . Against this coming end you should prepare , And your sweet semblance to some other give . So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination then you were Yourself again after yourself’s decease , When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear . Who lets so fair a house fall to decay , Which husbandry in honor might uphold Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day And barren rage of death’s eternal cold O , none but unthrifts , dear my love you know , You had a father let your son say so .
Good queen
Good queen , my lord , Good queen I say good queen And would by combat make her good , so were I A man , the worst about you .
Force her hence .
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes First hand me on mine own accord I’ll off But first I’ll do my errand . The good queen , For she is good , hath brought you forth a daughter Here ’tis commends it to your blessing .
Out A mankind witch Hence with her , out o’ door A most intelligencing bawd
Not so I am as ignorant in that as you In so entitling me , and no less honest Than you are mad which is enough , I’ll warrant , As this world goes , to pass for honest .
Traitors Will you not push her out Give her the bastard . Thou dotard thou art woman tired , unroosted By thy dame Partlet here . Take up the bastard Take’t up , I say give’t to thy crone .
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond
That he was never trainèd up in arms .
He said the truth . And what said Surrey then
He smiled and said The better for our purpose .
He was in the right , and so indeed it is .
Tell the clock there . Give me a calendar . He looks in an almanac Who saw the sun today
Not I , my lord .
Then he disdains to shine , for by the book He should have braved the east an hour ago A black day will it be to somebody . Ratcliffe
My lord .
The sun will not be seen today . The sky doth frown and lour upon our army . I would these dewy tears were from the ground . Not shine today Why , what is that to me More than to Richmond , for the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him .
Well , the best is , she hath no teeth to bite .
Item She will often praise her liquor .
If her liquor be good , she shall . If she will not , I will , for good things should be praised .
Item She is too liberal .
Of her tongue she cannot , for that’s writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not , for that I’ll keep shut . Now of another thing she may , and that cannot I help . Well , proceed .
Item She hath more hair than wit , and more faults than hairs , and more wealth than faults .
Stop there I’ll have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article . Rehearse that once more .
Item She hath more hair than wit
More hair than wit It may be I’ll prove it . The cover of the salt hides the salt , and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit , for the greater hides the less . What’s next
And more faults than hairs
I have his horse to take up the quarrel . I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil .
That’s monstrous . O , that that were out
He is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
And more wealth than faults .
There’s no remedy , sir he will fight with you for ’s oath sake . Marry , he hath better bethought him of his quarrel , and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of . Therefore , draw for the supportance of his vow . He protests he will not hurt you .
Why , that word makes the faults gracious . Well , I’ll have her an if it be a match , as nothing is impossible
For all this same , I’ll hide me hereabout . His looks I fear , and his intents I doubt .
What then
Pray God defend me A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man .
Thou detestable maw , thou womb of death , Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth , Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open , And in despite I’ll cram thee with more food
Why , then will I tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the north gate .
Give ground , if you see him furious .
For me
For thee Ay , who art thou He hath stayed for a better man than thee .
Stop thy unhallowed toil , vile Montague Can vengeance be pursued further than death Condemnèd villain , I do apprehend thee . Obey and go with me , for thou must die .
Come , Sir Andrew , there’s no remedy . The gentleman will , for his honor’s sake , have one bout with you . He cannot by the duello avoid it . But he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you . Come on , to ’t .

I must indeed , and therefore came I hither . Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man . Fly hence and leave me . Think upon these gone . Let them affright thee . I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury . O , be gone By heaven , I love thee better than myself , For I come hither armed against myself . Stay not , be gone . Live , and hereafter say A madman’s mercy bid thee run away .
And must I go to him
Pray God , he keep his oath
I do assure you , ’tis against my will .
Thou must run to him , for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn .
Why didst not tell me sooner Pox of your love letters
Put up your sword . If this young gentleman Have done offence , I take the fault on me . If you offend him , I for him defy you .
Now will he be swinged for reading my letter an unmannerly slave , that will thrust himself into secrets I’ll after , to rejoice in the boy’s correction .
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck , And yet methinks I have astronomy , But not to tell of good or evil luck , Of plagues , of dearths , or seasons quality Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell , Pointing to each his thunder , rain , and wind , Or say with princes if it shall go well , By oft predict that I in heaven find But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive , And , constant stars , in them I read such art As truth and beauty shall together thrive , If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert Or else of thee this I prognosticate Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date .
For ever Unvenerable be thy hands , if thou Takest up the princess by that forced baseness Which he has put upon’t
He dreads his wife .
So I would you did then ’twere past all doubt You’ld call your children yours .
A nest of traitors
I am none , by this good light .
Nor I , nor any But one that’s here , and that’s himself , for he The sacred honour of himself , his queen’s , His hopeful son’s , his babe’s , betrays to slander , Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s and will not For , as the case now stands , it is a curse He cannot be compell’d to’t once remove The root of his opinion , which is rotten As ever oak or stone was sound .
A callat Of boundless tongue , who late hath beat her husband And now baits me This brat is none of mine It is the issue of Polixenes Hence with it , and together with the dam Commit them to the fire
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .
When I consider every thing that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence commént When I perceive that men as plants increase , Cheerèd and checked ev n by the self same sky , Vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease , And wear their brave state out of memory Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you , most rich in youth , before my sight , Where wasteful time debateth with decay , To change your day of youth to sullied night And all in war with time for love of you , As he takes from you , I engraft you new .
Wilt thou provoke me Then have at thee , boy
O Lord , they fight I will go call the watch .
Oh , I am slain If thou be merciful , Open the tomb . Lay me with Juliet .
In faith , I will . Let me peruse this face . Mercutio’s kinsman , noble County Paris . What said my man , when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet . Said he not so Or did I dream it so Or am I mad , hearing him talk of Juliet , To think it was so O , give me thy hand , One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book . I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave .
A grave Oh , no . A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light . Death , lie thou there , by a dead man interred .
Arm , arm , my lord . The foe vaunts in the field .
Come , bustle , bustle . Caparison my horse . Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power . I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain , And thus my battle shall be orderèd My foreward shall be drawn out all in length , Consisting equally of horse and foot Our archers shall be placèd in the midst . John Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Earl of Surrey , Shall have the leading of this foot and horse . They thus directed , we will follow In the main battle , whose puissance on either side Shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse . This , and Saint George to boot What think’st thou , Norfolk
A good direction , warlike sovereign .
This found I on my tent this morning .
Jockey of Norfolk , be not so bold . For Dickon thy master is bought and sold . A thing devisèd by the enemy . Go , gentlemen , every man unto his charge . Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls . Conscience is but a word that cowards use , Devised at first to keep the strong in awe . Our strong arms be our conscience , swords our law .
It is yours And , might we lay the old proverb to your charge , So like you , ’tis the worse . Behold , my lords , Although the print be little , the whole matter And copy of the father , eye , nose , lip , The trick of’s frown , his forehead , nay , the valley , The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek , His smiles , The very mould and frame of hand , nail , finger And thou , good goddess Nature , which hast made it So like to him that got it , if thou hast The ordering of the mind too , ’mongst all colours No yellow in’t , lest she suspect , as he does , Her children not her husband’s
A gross hag And , lozel , thou art worthy to be hang’d , That wilt not stay her tongue .
Hang all the husbands That cannot do that feat , you’ll leave yourself Hardly one subject .
Once more , take her hence .
A most unworthy and unnatural lord Can do no more .
Sir Thurio , fear not but that she will love you , Now Valentine is banished from her sight .
Since his exile she hath despised me most , Forsworn my company and railed at me , That I am desperate of obtaining her .
This weak impress of love is as a figure Trenchèd in ice , which with an hour’s heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form . A little time will melt her frozen thoughts , And worthless Valentine shall be forgot .
How now , Sir Proteus Is your countryman , According to our proclamation , gone
Gone , my good lord .
My daughter takes his going grievously .
A little time , my lord , will kill that grief .
So I believe , but Thurio thinks not so . Proteus , the good conceit I hold of thee For thou hast shown some sign of good desert Makes me the better to confer with thee .
Longer than I prove loyal to Your Grace Let me not live to look upon Your Grace .
But wherefore do not you a mightier way Make war upon this bloody tyrant , time , And fortify yourself in your decay With means more blessèd than my barren rhyme Now stand you on the top of happy hours , And many maiden gardens , yet unset , With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers , Much liker than your painted counterfeit . So should the lines of life that life repair Which this time’s pencil or my pupil pen Neither in inward worth nor outward fair Can make you live yourself in eyes of men . To give away yourself keeps yourself still , And you must live , drawn by your own sweet skill .
I’ll ha’ thee burnt .
I care not It is an heretic that makes the fire , Not she which burns in’t . I’ll not call you tyrant But this most cruel usage of your queen , Not able to produce more accusation Than your own weak hinged fancy , something savours Of tyranny and will ignoble make you , Yea , scandalous to the world .
On your allegiance , Out of the chamber with her Were I a tyrant , Where were her life she durst not call me so , If she did know me one . Away with her
I pray you , do not push me I’ll be gone . Look to your babe , my lord ’tis yours Jove send her A better guiding spirit What needs these hands You , that are thus so tender o’er his follies , Will never do him good , not one of you . So , so farewell we are gone .
Thou , traitor , hast set on thy wife to this . My child away with’t Even thou , that hast A heart so tender o’er it , take it hence And see it instantly consumed with fire Even thou and none but thou . Take it up straight Within this hour bring me word ’tis done , And by good testimony , or I’ll seize thy life , With what thou else call’st thine . If thou refuse And wilt encounter with my wrath , say so The bastard brains with these my proper hands Shall I dash out . Go , take it to the fire For thou set’st on thy wife .
How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry , which their keepers call A lightning before death Oh , how may I Call this a lightning O my love , my wife Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty . Thou art not conquered . Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks , And death’s pale flag is not advancèd there . Tybalt , liest thou there in thy bloody sheet O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy Forgive me , cousin . Ah , dear Juliet , Why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour For fear of that , I still will stay with thee , And never from this palace of dim night Depart again . Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids . Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world wearied flesh . Eyes , look your last . Arms , take your last embrace . And , lips , O you The doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death . O true apothecary , Thy drugs are quick . Thus with a kiss I die .
You , sir Why , what are you
One , sir , that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will .
Nay , if you be an undertaker , I am for you .
O good Sir Toby , hold Here come the officers .
I’ll be with you anon .
Pray , sir , put your sword up , if you please .
Marry , will I , sir . And for that I promised you , I’ll be as good as my word . He will bear you easily and reins well .
This is the man . Do thy office .
Antonio , I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino .
You do mistake me , sir .
No , sir , no jot . I know your favor well , Though now you have no sea cap on your head . Take him away . He knows I know him well .
I must obey . This comes with seeking you But there’s no remedy . I shall answer it .
Thou know’st how willingly I would effect The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter .
I do , my lord .
And also , I think , thou art not ignorant How she opposes her against my will .
She did , my lord , when Valentine was here .
Ay , and perversely she persevers so . What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine , and love Sir Thurio
The best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood , cowardice , and poor descent , Three things that women highly hold in hate .
Ay , but she’ll think that it is spoke in hate .
Ay , if his enemy deliver it Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken By one whom she esteemeth as his friend .
Then you must undertake to slander him .
And that , my lord , I shall be loath to do . ’Tis an ill office for a gentleman , Especially against his very friend .
Where your good word cannot advantage him , Your slander never can endamage him Therefore the office is indifferent , Being entreated to it by your friend .
Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were filled with your most high deserts Though yet heav n knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life and shows not half your parts . If I could write the beauty of your eyes And in fresh numbers number all your graces , The age to come would say , This poet lies Such heavenly touches ne er touched earthly faces . So should my papers , yellowed with their age , Be scorned , like old men of less truth than tongue , And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage And stretchèd meter of an ántique song But were some child of yours alive that time , You should live twice in it and in my rhyme .
March on . Join bravely . Let us to it pell mell If not to heaven , then hand in hand to hell . His oration to his army What shall I say more than I have inferred Remember whom you are to cope withal , A sort of vagabonds , rascals , and runaways , A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants , Whom their o er cloyèd country vomits forth To desperate ventures and assured destruction . You sleeping safe , they bring to you unrest You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives , They would restrain the one , distain the other . And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow , Long kept in Brittany at our mother’s cost , A milksop , one that never in his life Felt so much cold as overshoes in snow Let’s whip these stragglers o er the seas again , Lash hence these overweening rags of France , These famished beggars weary of their lives , Who , but for dreaming on this fond exploit , For want of means , poor rats , had hanged themselves . If we be conquered , let men conquer us , And not these bastard Bretons , whom our fathers Have in their own land beaten , bobbed , and thumped , And in record , left them the heirs of shame . Shall these enjoy our lands , lie with our wives , Ravish our daughters
Hark I hear their drum . Fight , gentlemen of England . Fight , bold yeomen . Draw , archers , draw your arrows to the head . Spur your proud horses hard , and ride in blood . Amaze the welkin with your broken staves
I did not , sir These lords , my noble fellows , if they please , Can clear me in’t .
We can my royal liege , He is not guilty of her coming hither .
You’re liars all .
Beseech your highness , give us better credit We have always truly served you , and beseech you So to esteem of us , and on our knees we beg , As recompense of our dear services Past and to come , that you do change this purpose , Which being so horrible , so bloody , must Lead on to some foul issue we all kneel .
I am a feather for each wind that blows Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father better burn it now Than curse it then . But be it let it live . It shall not neither . You , sir , come you hither You that have been so tenderly officious With Lady Margery , your midwife there , To save this bastard’s life , for ’tis a bastard , So sure as this beard’s grey , what will you adventure To save this brat’s life
Saint Francis be my speed How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves Who’s there
Here’s one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
Bliss be upon you Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls As I discern , It burneth in the Capels monument .
It doth so , holy sir , and there’s my master , One that you love .
Who is it
Romeo .
How long hath he been there
Full half an hour .
Go with me to the vault .
I dare not , sir . My master knows not but I am gone hence , And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents .
Stay , then . I’ll go alone . Fear comes upon me . Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .
You have prevailed , my lord . If I can do it By aught that I can speak in his dispraise , She shall not long continue love to him . But say this weed her love from Valentine , It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio .
Therefore , as you unwind her love from him , Lest it should ravel and be good to none , You must provide to bottom it on me Which must be done by praising me as much As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine .
And , Proteus , we dare trust you in this kind Because we know , on Valentine’s report , You are already Love’s firm votary And cannot soon revolt and change your mind . Upon this warrant shall you have access Where you with Sylvia may confer at large For she is lumpish , heavy , melancholy , And , for your friend’s sake , will be glad of you , Where you may temper her by your persuasion To hate young Valentine and love my friend .
As much as I can do , I will effect . But you , Sir Thurio , are not sharp enough You must lay lime to tangle her desires By wailful sonnets , whose composèd rhymes Should be full fraught with serviceable vows .
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day Thou art more lovely and more temperate . Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May , And summer’s lease hath all too short a date . Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines , And often is his gold complexion dimmed And every fair from fair sometime declines , By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed . But thy eternal summer shall not fade , Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st , Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade , When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st . So long as men can breathe or eyes can see , So long lives this , and this gives life to thee .
Any thing , my lord , That my ability may undergo And nobleness impose at least thus much I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left To save the innocent any thing possible .
It shall be possible . Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding .
I will , my lord .
Mark and perform it , see’st thou for the fail Of any point in’t shall not only be Death to thyself but to thy lewd tongued wife , Whom for this time we pardon . We enjoin thee , As thou art liege man to us , that thou carry This female bastard hence and that thou bear it To some remote and desert place quite out Of our dominions , and that there thou leave it , Without more mercy , to its own protection And favour of the climate . As by strange fortune It came to us , I do in justice charge thee , On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture , That thou commend it strangely to some place Where chance may nurse or end it . Take it up .
I swear to do this , though a present death Had been more merciful . Come on , poor babe Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens To be thy nurses Wolves and bears , they say Casting their savageness aside have done Like offices of pity . Sir , be prosperous In more than this deed does require And blessing Against this cruelty fight on thy side , Poor thing , condemn’d to loss
What will you do , now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you Than what befalls myself . You stand amazed , But be of comfort .
Come , sir , away .
I must entreat of you some of that money .
What money , sir For the fair kindness you have showed me here , And part being prompted by your present trouble , Out of my lean and low ability I’ll lend you something . My having is not much . I’ll make division of my present with you . Hold , there’s half my coffer .
Will you deny me now Is ’t possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion Do not tempt my misery , Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you .
I know of none , Nor know I you by voice or any feature . I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood
O heavens themselves
Come , sir , I pray you , go .
What says Lord Stanley Will he bring his power
My lord , he doth deny to come .
Off with his son George’s head
My lord , the enemy is past the marsh . After the battle let George Stanley die .
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom . Advance our standards . Set upon our foes . Our ancient word of courage , fair Saint George , Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons . Upon them Victory sits on our helms .
Let me speak a little . This youth that you see here I snatched one half out of the jaws of death , Relieved him with such sanctity of love , And to his image , which methought did promise Most venerable worth , did I devotion .
What’s that to us The time goes by . Away
But oh , how vile an idol proves this god Thou hast , Sebastian , done good feature shame . In nature there’s no blemish but the mind . None can be called deformed but the unkind . Virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o erflourished by the devil .
The man grows mad . Away with him . Come , come , sir .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
Lead me on .
Romeo O , pale Who else What , Paris too And steeped in blood Ah , what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance The lady stirs .
Rescue , my lord of Norfolk , rescue , rescue The king enacts more wonders than a man , Daring an opposite to every danger . His horse is slain , and all on foot he fights , Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death . Rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost
A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse
Withdraw , my lord . I’ll help you to a horse .
Slave , I have set my life upon a cast , And I will stand the hazard of the die . I think there be six Richmonds in the field Five have I slain today instead of him . A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse
Devouring Time , blunt thou the lion’s paws , And make the earth devour her own sweet brood Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws , And burn the long lived phoenix in her blood Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st , And do whate er thou wilt , swift footed time , To the wide world and all her fading sweets But I forbid thee one most heinous crime O carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow , Nor draw no lines there with thine ántique pen . Him in thy course untainted do allow For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men . Yet do thy worst , old Time despite thy wrong , My love shall in my verse ever live young .
O comfortable Friar Where is my lord I do remember well where I should be , And there I am . Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise . Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep . A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents . Come , come away . Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too . Come , I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns . Stay not to question , for the watch is coming . Come , go , good Juliet . I dare no longer stay .
Methinks his words do from such passion fly , That he believes himself . So do not I . Prove true , imagination , oh , prove true , That I , dear brother , be now ta en for you
Ay , much is the force of heaven bred poesy .
Come hither , knight . Come hither , Fabian . We’ll whisper o er a couplet or two of most sage saws .
Say that upon the altar of her beauty You sacrifice your tears , your sighs , your heart . Write till your ink be dry , and with your tears Moist it again , and frame some feeling line That may discover such integrity For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews , Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones , Make tigers tame , and huge leviathans Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands . After your dire lamenting elegies , Visit by night your lady’s chamber window With some sweet consort . To their instruments Tune a deploring dump the night’s dead silence Will well become such sweet complaining grievance . This , or else nothing , will inherit her .
He named Sebastian . I my brother know Yet living in my glass . Even such and so In favor was my brother , and he went
This discipline shows thou hast been in love .
And thy advice this night I’ll put in practice . Therefore , sweet Proteus , my direction giver , Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music . I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good advice .
No , I’ll not rear Another’s issue .
Please your highness , posts From those you sent to the oracle are come An hour since Cleomenes and Dion , Being well arrived from Delphos , are both landed , Hasting to the court .
So please you , sir , their speed Hath been beyond account .
Twenty three days They have been absent ’tis good speed foretells The great Apollo suddenly will have The truth of this appear . Prepare you , lords Summon a session , that we may arraign Our most disloyal lady , for , as she hath Been publicly accused , so shall she have A just and open trial . While she lives My heart will be a burthen to me . Leave me , And think upon my bidding .
The climate’s delicate , the air most sweet , Fertile the isle , the temple much surpassing The common praise it bears .
I shall report , For most it caught me , the celestial habits , Methinks I so should term them , and the reverence Of the grave wearers . O , the sacrifice How ceremonious , solemn and unearthly It was i’ the offering
But of all , the burst And the ear deafening voice o’ the oracle , Kin to Jove’s thunder , so surprised my sense . That I was nothing .
If the event o’ the journey Prove as successful to the queen , O be’t so As it hath been to us rare , pleasant , speedy , The time is worth the use on’t .
Great Apollo Turn all to the best These proclamations , So forcing faults upon Hermione , I little like .
Go , get thee hence , for I will not away .
What’s here A cup , closed in my true love’s hand Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end . O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after I will kiss thy lips . Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative . Thy lips are warm .
Lead , boy . Which way
Yea , noise Then I’ll be brief . O happy dagger , This is thy sheath . There rust and let me die .
This is the place . There , where the torch doth burn .
The ground is bloody . Search about the churchyard . Go , some of you . Whoe er you find , attach .
Pitiful sight Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried . Go , tell the Prince . Run to the Capulets . Raise up the Montagues . Some others search .
God and your arms be praised , victorious friends The day is ours the bloody dog is dead .
Courageous Richmond , well hast thou acquit thee . Lo , here this long usurpèd royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch Have I plucked off , to grace thy brows withal . Wear it , enjoy it , and make much of it .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all But tell me , is young George Stanley living
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester town , Whither , if it please you , we may now withdraw us .
What men of name are slain on either side
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter , Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
Inter their bodies as becomes their births . Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled That in submission will return to us . And then , as we have ta en the sacrament , We will unite the white rose and the red .
A woman’s face , with nature’s own hand painted , Hast thou , the master mistress of my passion A woman’s gentle heart , but not acquainted With shifting change , as is false women’s fashion An eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling , Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth A man in hue , all hues in his controlling , Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth . And for a woman wert thou first created , Till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting , And by addition me of thee defeated , By adding one thing to my purpose nothing . But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure , Mine be thy love , and thy love’s use their treasure .
Still in this fashion , color , ornament , For him I imitate . Oh , if it prove , Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love
A very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare . His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him . And for his cowardship , ask Fabian .
A coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
Slid , I’ll after him again and beat him .
Do , cuff him soundly , but never draw thy sword .
An I do not
Come , let’s see the event .
I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet .
About it , gentlemen
We’ll wait upon Your Grace till after supper , And afterward determine our proceedings .
Even now about it I will pardon you .
The violent carriage of it Will clear or end the busine when the oracle , Thus by Apollo’s great divine seal’d up , Shall the contents discover , something rare Even then will rush to knowledge . Go fresh horses And gracious be the issue Exeunt .
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie , But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry .
Here’s Romeo’s man . We found him in the churchyard .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps . We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard’s side .
A great suspicion . Stay the friar too .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad
Oh , the people in the street cry Romeo , Some Juliet , and some Paris , and all run With open outcry toward our monument .
So is it not with me as with that muse , Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse , Who heav n itself for ornament doth use , And every fair with his fair doth rehearse Making a couplement of proud compare With sun and moon , with earth and sea’s rich gems , With April’s first born flow rs , and all things rare That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems . O let me , true in love but truly write , And then believe me my love is as fair As any mother’s child , though not so bright As those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air . Let them say more that like of hearsay well I will not praise that purpose not to sell .
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction , That long have frowned upon their enmity . What traitor hears me and says not Amen England hath long been mad and scarred herself . The brother blindly shed the brother’s blood . The father rashly slaughtered his own son . The son , compelled , been butcher to the sire . All this divided York and Lancaster , Divided , in their dire division . O , now let Richmond and Elizabeth , The true succeeders of each royal house , By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together , And let their heirs , God , if thy will be so . Enrich the time to come with smooth faced peace , With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days Abate the edge of traitors , gracious Lord , That would reduce these bloody days again , And make poor England weep in streams of blood Let them not live to taste this land’s increase , That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace . Now civil wounds are stopped , peace lives again . That she may long live here , God say amen .
Fellows , stand fast . I see a passenger .
If there be ten , shrink not , but down with ’em .
Stand , sir And throw us that you have about ye . If not , we’ll make you sit , and rifle you .
Sir , we are undone . These are the villains That all the travelers do fear so much .
My friends
That’s not so , sir . We are your enemies .
Peace We’ll hear him .
Ay , by my beard will we , for he is a proper man .
Then know that I have little wealth to lose . A man I am , crossed with adversity My riches are these poor habiliments , Of which if you should here disfurnish me You take the sum and substance that I have .
Whither travel you
To Verona .
Whence came you
From Milan .
Have you long sojourned there
Some sixteen months , and longer might have stayed If crooked fortune had not thwarted me .
Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you
Go to , go to , thou art a foolish fellow . Let me be clear of thee .
Well held out , i faith . No , I do not know you , nor I am not sent to you by my lady , to bid you come speak with her , nor your name is not Master Cesario , nor this is not my nose neither . Nothing that is so is so .
I prithee , vent thy folly somewhere else . Thou know’st not me .
Vent my folly He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool . Vent my folly I am afraid this great lubber , the world , will prove a cockney . I prithee now , ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady . Shall I vent to her that thou art coming
I prithee , foolish Greek , depart from me . There’s money for thee . If you tarry longer , I shall give worse payment .
By my troth , thou hast an open hand . These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years purchase .
What fear is this which startles in our ears
Sovereign , here lies the County Paris slain , And Romeo dead , and Juliet , dead before , Warm and new killed .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
Here is a friar , and slaughtered Romeo’s man , With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs .
O heavens O wife , look how our daughter bleeds This dagger hath mista en for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom .
O me This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .
Come , Montague , for thou art early up To see thy son and heir now early down .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight . Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath . What further woe conspires against mine age
Look , and thou shalt see .
O thou untaught What manners is in this , To press before thy father to a grave
What were you banished thence
I was .
For what offence
For that which now torments me to rehearse I killed a man , whose death I much repent , But yet I slew him manfully in fight Without false vantage or base treachery .
Why , ne’er repent it , if it were done so . But were you banished for so small a fault
I was , and held me glad of such a doom .
Have you the tongues
My youthful travel therein made me happy , Or else I often had been miserable .
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat friar , This fellow were a king for our wild faction
We’ll have him . Sirs , a word .
Master , be one of them . It’s an honorable kind of thievery .
Peace , villain
Tell us this have you anything to take to
Nothing but my fortune .
Know , then , that some of us are gentlemen , Such as the fury of ungoverned youth Thrust from the company of awful men . Myself was from Verona banishèd For practicing to steal away a lady , An heir , and near allied unto the Duke .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death . Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience . Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder . And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemnèd and myself excused .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale . Romeo , there dead , was husband to that Juliet , And she , there dead , that Romeo’s faithful wife . I married them , and their stol n marriage day Was Tybalt’s doomsday , whose untimely death Banished the new made bridegroom from the city For whom , and not for Tybalt , Juliet pined . You , to remove that siege of grief from her , Betrothed and would have married her perforce To County Paris . Then comes she to me , And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage , Or in my cell there would she kill herself . Then gave I her , so tutored by my art , A sleeping potion , which so took effect As I intended , for it wrought on her The form of death .
My glass shall not persuade me I am old So long as youth and thou are of one date But when in thee time’s furrows I behold , Then look I death my days should expiate . For all that beauty that doth cover thee Is but the seemly raiment of my heart , Which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me . How can I then be elder than thou art O therefore , love , be of thyself so wary As I , not for myself , but for thee will , Bearing thy heart , which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from faring ill . Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again .
Now , sir , have I met you again There’s for you .
Why , there’s for thee , and there , and there . Are all the people mad
Hold , sir , or I’ll throw your dagger o er the house .
This will I tell my lady straight . I would not be in some of your coats for two pence .
Come on , sir , hold
Nay , let him alone . I’ll go another way to work with him . I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria . Though I struck him first , yet it’s no matter for that .
This sessions , to our great grief we pronounce , Even pushes ’gainst our heart the party tried The daughter of a king , our wife , and one Of us too much beloved . Let us be clear’d Of being tyrannous , since we so openly Proceed in justice , which shall have due course , Even to the guilt or the purgation . Produce the prisoner .
Let go thy hand .
Come , sir , I will not let you go . Come , my young soldier , put up your iron . You are well fleshed . Come on .
It is his highness’ pleasure that the queen Appear in person here in court . Silence
I will be free from thee .
Read the indictment .
Hermione , queen to the worthy Leontes , king of Sicilia , thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason , in committing adultery with Polixenes , king of Bohemia , and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king , thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open , thou , Hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for their better safety , to fly away by night .
And I from Mantua , for a gentleman Who , in my mood , I stabbed unto the heart .
And I for suchlike petty crimes as these . But to the purpose for we cite our faults That they may hold excused our lawless lives And partly , seeing you are beautified With goodly shape , and by your own report A linguist , and a man of such perfection As we do in our quality much want
Indeed , because you are a banished man , Therefore , above the rest , we parley to you . Are you content to be our general To make a virtue of necessity And live , as we do , in this wilderness
What sayst thou Wilt thou be of our consort Say ay , and be the captain of us all . We’ll do thee homage , and be ruled by thee , Love thee as our commander and our king .
But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest .
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered .
I take your offer and will live with you , Provided that you do no outrages On silly women or poor passengers .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion’s force should cease . But he which bore my letter , Friar John , Was stayed by accident , and yesternight Returned my letter back . Then all alone At the prefixèd hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault , Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo , But when I came , some minute ere the time Of her awakening , here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead . She wakes , and I entreated her come forth , And bear this work of heaven with patience . But then a noise did scare me from the tomb , And she , too desperate , would not go with me , But , as it seems , did violence on herself . All this I know , and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy . And if aught in this Miscarried by my fault , let my old life Be sacrificed some hour before his time Unto the rigor of severest law .
We still have known thee for a holy man . Where’s Romeo’s man What can he say in this
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death , And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place , to this same monument . This letter he early bid me give his father , And threatened me with death , going in the vault , If I departed not and left him there .
As an unperfect actor on the stage , Who with his fear is put besides his part , Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage , Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart So I , for fear of trust , forget to say The perfect ceremony of love’s rite , And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay , O ercharged with burden of mine own love’s might . O let my books be then the eloquence And dumb presagers of my speaking breast , Who plead for love and look for recompense More than that tongue that more hath more expressed . O learn to read what silent love hath writ To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit .
What wouldst thou now If thou darest tempt me further , draw thy sword .
What , what Nay , then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you .
Hold , Toby On thy life I charge thee , hold
Madam
Will it be ever thus Ungracious wretch , Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves , Where manners ne er were preach’d Out of my sight Be not offended , dear Cesario . Rudesby , be gone
I prithee , gentle friend , Let thy fair wisdom , not thy passion , sway In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace . Go with me to my house , And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botched up , that thou thereby Mayst smile at this . Thou shalt not choose but go . Do not deny . Beshrew his soul for me He started one poor heart of mine in thee .
What relish is in this How runs the stream Or I am mad , or else this is a dream . Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep .
Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself , it shall scarce boot me To say ‘not guilty ’ mine integrity Being counted falsehood , shall , as I express it , Be so received . But thus if powers divine Behold our human actions , as they do , I doubt not then but innocence shall make False accusation blush and tyranny Tremble at patience . You , my lord , best know , Who least will seem to do so , my past life Hath been as continent , as chaste , as true , As I am now unhappy which is more Than history can pattern , though devised And play’d to take spectators . For behold me A fellow of the royal bed , which owe A moiety of the throne a great king’s daughter , The mother to a hopeful prince , here standing To prate and talk for life and honour ’fore Who please to come and hear . For life , I prize it As I weigh grief , which I would spare for honour , ’Tis a derivative from me to mine , And only that I stand for . I appeal To your own conscience , sir , before Polixenes Came to your court , how I was in your grace , How merited to be so since he came , With what encounter so uncurrent I Have strain’d to appear thus if one jot beyond The bound of honour , or in act or will That way inclining , harden’d be the hearts Of all that hear me , and my near’st of kin Cry fie upon my grave
Give me the letter . I will look on it . Where is the county’s page , that raised the watch Sirrah , what made your master in this place
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave , And bid me stand aloof , and so I did . Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb , And by and by my master drew on him , And then I ran away to call the watch .
This letter doth make good the friar’s words , Their course of love , the tidings of her death . And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor pothecary , and therewithal Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet . Where be these enemies Capulet Montague See what a scourge is laid upon your hate , That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love And I , for winking at your discords , too Have lost a brace of kinsmen . All are punished .
O brother Montague , give me thy hand . This is my daughter’s jointure , for no more Can I demand .
But I can give thee more , For I will raise her statue in pure gold , That whiles Verona by that name is known , There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet .
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie , Poor sacrifices of our enmity .
No , we detest such vile base practices . Come , go with us . We’ll bring thee to our crews And show thee all the treasure we have got , Which , with ourselves , all rest at thy dispose .
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart . My body is the frame wherein ’tis held , And pérspective it is best painter’s art . For through the painter must you see his skill To find where your true image pictured lies , Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still , That hath his windows glazèd with thine eyes . Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done Mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me Are windows to my breast , wherethrough the sun Delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee . Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art They draw but what they see , know not the heart .
I ne’er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first .
That’s true enough Through ’tis a saying , sir , not due to me .
You will not own it .
More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault , I must not At all acknowledge . For Polixenes , With whom I am accused , I do confess I loved him as in honour he required , With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me , with a love even such , So and no other , as yourself commanded Which not to have done I think had been in me Both disobedience and ingratitude To you and toward your friend , whose love had spoke , Even since it could speak , from an infant , freely That it was yours . Now , for conspiracy , I know not how it tastes though it be dish’d For me to try how all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man And why he left your court , the gods themselves , Wotting no more than I , are ignorant .
If it be thus to dream , still let me sleep
Nay , come , I prithee . Would thou’dst be ruled by me
Madam , I will .
Oh , say so , and so be
A glooming peace this morning with it brings . The sun , for sorrow , will not show his head . Go hence , to have more talk of these sad things . Some shall be pardoned , and some punishèd . For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo .
Already have I been false to Valentine , And now I must be as unjust to Thurio . Under the color of commending him , I have access my own love to prefer . But Sylvia is too fair , too true , too holy To be corrupted with my worthless gifts . When I protest true loyalty to her , She twits me with my falsehood to my friend . When to her beauty I commend my vows , She bids me think how I have been forsworn In breaking faith with Julia , whom I loved . And notwithstanding all her sudden quips , The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope , Yet , spaniel like , the more she spurns my love , The more it grows and fawneth on her still . But here comes Thurio . Now must we to her window And give some evening music to her ear .
How now , Sir Proteus , are you crept before us
Ay , gentle Thurio , for you know that love Will creep in service where it cannot go .
Ay , but I hope , sir , that you love not here .
Let those who are in favor with their stars Of public honor and proud titles boast , Whilst I , whom fortune of such triumph bars , Unlooked for joy in that I honor most . Great princes favorites their fair leaves spread But as the marigold at the sun’s eye , And in themselves their pride lies burièd , For at a frown they in their glory die . The painful warrior famousèd for worth , After a thousand victories once foiled , Is from the book of honor razèd quite , And all the rest forgot for which he toiled . Then happy I that love and am belovèd Where I may not remove nor be removèd .
You knew of his departure , as you know What you have underta’en to do in’s absence .
Sir , You speak a language that I understand not My life stands in the level of your dreams , Which I’ll lay down .
Your actions are my dreams You had a bastard by Polixenes , And I but dream’d it . As you were past all shame , Those of your fact are so so past all truth Which to deny concerns more than avails for as Thy brat hath been cast out , like to itself , No father owning it , which is , indeed , More criminal in thee than it , so thou Shalt feel our justice , in whose easiest passage Look for no less than death .
Sir , spare your threats The bug which you would fright me with I seek . To me can life be no commodity The crown and comfort of my life , your favour , I do give lost for I do feel it gone , But know not how it went . My second joy And first fruits of my body , from his presence I am barr’d , like one infectious . My third comfort Starr’d most unluckily , is from my breast , The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth , Haled out to murder myself on every post Proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred The child bed privilege denied , which ’longs To women of all fashion lastly , hurried Here to this place , i’ the open air , before I have got strength of limit . Now , my liege , Tell me what blessings I have here alive , That I should fear to die Therefore proceed . But yet hear this mistake me not no life , I prize it not a straw , but for mine honour , Which I would free , if I shall be condemn’d Upon surmises , all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake , I tell you ’Tis rigor and not law . Your honours all , I do refer me to the oracle Apollo be my judge
Nay , I prithee , put on this gown and this beard . Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate . Do it quickly . I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst .
Well , I’ll put it on , and I will dissemble myself in ’t , and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown .
I am not tall enough to become the function well , nor lean enough to be thought a good student , but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar . The competitors enter .
Jove bless thee , master Parson .
Bonos dies , Sir Toby . For , as the old hermit of Prague , that never saw pen and ink , very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc , That that is is . So I , being Master Parson , am Master Parson . For , what is that but that , and is but is
To him , Sir Topas .
Sir , but I do , or else I would be hence .
Who Sylvia
Ay , Sylvia for your sake .
I thank you for your own . Now , gentlemen , Let’s tune , and to it lustily awhile .
Now , my young guest , methinks you’re allycholly . I pray you , why is it
Marry , mine Host , because I cannot be merry .
Come , we’ll have you merry . I’ll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for .
But shall I hear him speak
Ay , that you shall .
That will be music .
Hark hark
Is he among these
Ay , but peace Let’s hear ’em .
Who is Sylvia What is she , That all our swains commend her Holy , fair , and wise is she The heaven such grace did lend her , That she might admirèd be . Is she kind as she is fair For beauty lives with kindness . Love doth to her eyes repair To help him of his blindness , And , being helped , inhabits there . Then to Sylvia let us sing , That Sylvia is excelling . She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling . To her let us garlands bring .
Lord of my love , to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit , To thee I send this written embassage , To witness duty , not to show my wit . Duty so great , which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare , in wanting words to show it , But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy soul’s thought , all naked , will bestow it . Till whatsoever star that guides my moving Points on me graciously with fair aspéct And puts apparel on my tattered loving , To show me worthy of thy sweet respect . Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee Till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me .
This your request Is altogether just therefore bring forth , And in Apollos name , his oracle .
The Emperor of Russia was my father O that he were alive , and here beholding His daughter’s trial that he did but see The flatness of my misery , yet with eyes Of pity , not revenge
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice , That you , Cleomenes and Dion , have Been both at Delphos , and from thence have brought The seal’d up oracle , by the hand deliver’d Of great Apollo’s priest and that , since then , You have not dared to break the holy seal Nor read the secrets in’t .
All this we swear .
Break up the seals and read .
Hermione is chaste Polixenes blameless Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the king shall live without an heir , if that which is lost be not found .
What ho , I say Peace in this prison
The knave counterfeits well . A good knave .
Who calls there
Sir Topas the curate , who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , go to my lady
Out , hyperbolical fiend How vexest thou this man Talkest thou nothing but of ladies
Well said , Master Parson .
Sir Topas , never was man thus wronged . Good Sir Topas , do not think I am mad . They have laid me here in hideous darkness .
Fie , thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most modest terms , for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy . Sayest thou that house is dark
As hell , Sir Topas .
Why , it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony . And yet complainest thou of obstruction
I am not mad , Sir Topas . I say to you this house is dark .
How now Are you sadder than you were before How do you , man The music likes you not .
You mistake the musician likes me not .
Why , my pretty youth
He plays false , father .
How Out of tune on the strings
Not so , but yet so false that he grieves my very heartstrings .
You have a quick ear .
Ay , I would I were deaf it makes me have a slow heart .
I perceive you delight not in music .
Not a whit , when it jars so .
Hark , what fine change is in the music
Ay , that change is the spite .
You would have them always play but one thing
I would always have one play but one thing . But , Host , doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on often resort unto this gentlewoman
I tell you what Lance , his man , told me he loved her out of all nick .
Where is Lance
Gone to seek his dog , which tomorrow , by his master’s command , he must carry for a present to his lady .
Peace Stand aside . The company parts .
Sir Thurio , fear not you . I will so plead That you shall say my cunning drift excels .
Where meet we
At Saint Gregory’s well .
Now blessed be the great Apollo
Praised
Hast thou read truth
Ay , my lord even so As it is here set down .
There is no truth at all i’ the oracle The sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood .
My lord the king , the king
What is the business
O sir , I shall be hated to report it The prince your son , with mere conceit and fear Of the queen’s speed , is gone .
How gone
Is dead .
Apollo’s angry and the heavens themselves Do strike at my injustice .
How now there
This news is mortal to the queen look down And see what death is doing .
Take her hence Her heart is but o’ercharged she will recover I have too much believed mine own suspicion Beseech you , tenderly apply to her Some remedies for life .
Weary with toil , I haste me to my bed , The dear repose for limbs with travail tired But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind , when body’s work’s expired . For then my thoughts , from far where I abide , Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee , And keep my drooping eyelids open wide , Looking on darkness which the blind do see . Save that my soul’s imaginary sight Presents thy shadow to my sightless view , Which , like a jewel hung in ghastly night , Makes black night beauteous , and her old face new . Lo thus by day my limbs , by night my mind , For thee , and for myself , no quiet find .
Madman , thou errest . I say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog .
I say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell . And I say , there was never man thus abused . I am no more mad than you are . Make the trial of it in any constant question .
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
What thinkest thou of his opinion
I think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
Fare thee well . Remain thou still in darkness . Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam . Fare thee well .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas
My most exquisite Sir Topas
Nay , I am for all waters .
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown . He sees thee not .
Farewell .
Madam , good even to your ladyship .
I thank you for your music , gentlemen . Who is that that spake
One , lady , if you knew his pure heart’s truth , You would quickly learn to know him by his voice .
Sir Proteus , as I take it .
Sir Proteus , gentle lady , and your servant .
What’s your will
That I may compass yours .
You have your wish . My will is even this That presently you hie you home to bed . Thou subtle , perjured , false , disloyal man Think’st thou I am so shallow , so conceitless , To be seducèd by thy flattery , That hast deceived so many with thy vows Return , return , and make thy love amends . For me , by this pale queen of night I swear , I am so far from granting thy request That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit , And by and by intend to chide myself Even for this time I spend in talking to thee .
To him in thine own voice , and bring me word how thou findest him . I would we were well rid of this knavery . If he may be conveniently delivered , I would he were , for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot . Come by and by to my chamber .
Hey , Robin , jolly Robin , Tell me how thy lady does .
Fool
My lady is unkind , perdy .
Fool
Alas , why is she so
Fool , I say
She loves another Who calls , ha
Good fool , as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand , help me to a candle , and pen , ink , and paper . As I am a gentleman , I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t .
Master Malvolio
Ay , good fool .
Apollo , pardon My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes , New woo my queen , recall the good Camillo , Whom I proclaim a man of truth , of mercy For , being transported by my jealousies To bloody thoughts and to revenge , I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes which had been done , But that the good mind of Camillo tardied My swift command , though I with death and with Reward did threaten and encourage him , Not doing ’t and being done he , most humane And fill’d with honour , to my kingly guest Unclasp’d my practise , quit his fortunes here , Which you knew great , and to the hazard Of all encertainties himself commended , No richer than his honour how he glisters Thorough my rust and how his pity Does my deeds make the blacker
Woe the while O , cut my lace , lest my heart , cracking it , Break too .
I grant , sweet love , that I did love a lady , But she is dead .
’Twere false , if I should speak it , For I am sure she is not burièd .
Say that she be , yet Valentine , thy friend , Survives , to whom thyself art witness I am betrothed . And art thou not ashamed To wrong him with thy importunacy
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead .
And so suppose am I , for in his grave , Assure thyself , my love is burièd .
Sweet lady , let me rake it from the earth .
Go to thy lady’s grave and call hers thence . Or , at the least , in hers sepulchre thine .
He heard not that .
Madam , if your heart be so obdurate , Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love , The picture that is hanging in your chamber . To that I’ll speak , to that I’ll sigh and weep For , since the substance of your perfect self Is else devoted , I am but a shadow , And to your shadow will I make true love .
If ’twere a substance , you would , sure , deceive it , And make it but a shadow , as I am .
How can I then return in happy plight That am debarred the benefit of rest When day’s oppression is not eased by night , But day by night and night by day oppressed And each , though enemies to either’s reign , Do in consent shake hands to torture me , The one by toil , the other to complain How far I toil , still farther off from thee . I tell the day to please him thou art bright , And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven . So flatter I the swart complexioned night , When sparkling stars twire not , thou gild’st the even . But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer , And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger .
Alas , sir , how fell you besides your five wits
Fool , there was never a man so notoriously abused I am as well in my wits , Fool , as thou art .
But as well Then you are mad indeed , if you be no better in your wits than a fool .
They have here propertied me , keep me in darkness , send ministers to me asses and do all they can to face me out of my wits .
Advise you what you say . The minister is here . Malvolio , Malvolio , thy wits the heavens restore Endeavor thyself to sleep , and leave thy vain bibble babble .
Sir Topas
I will , sir , I will .
Fool , fool , fool , I say
Alas , sir , be patient . What say you sir I am shent for speaking to you .
Good fool , help me to some light and some paper . I tell thee , I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria .
Well a day that you were , sir .
What fit is this , good lady
What studied torments , tyrant , hast for me What wheels racks fires what flaying boiling In leads or oils what old or newer torture Must I receive , whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny Together working with thy jealousies , Fancies too weak for boys , too green and idle For girls of nine , O , think what they have done And then run mad indeed , stark mad for all Thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it . That thou betray’dst Polixenes , ’twas nothing That did but show thee , of a fool , inconstant And damnable ingrateful nor was’t much , Thou wouldst have poison’d good Camillo’s honour , To have him kill a king poor trespasses , More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter To be or none or little though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere done’t Nor is’t directly laid to thee , the death Of the young prince , whose honourable thoughts , Thoughts high for one so tender , cleft the heart That could conceive a gross and foolish sire Blemish’d his gracious dam this is not , no , Laid to thy answer but the last , O lords , When I have said , cry ‘woe ’ the queen , the queen , The sweet’st , dear’st creature’s dead , and vengeance for’t Not dropp’d down yet .
I am very loath to be your idol , sir . But since your falsehood shall become you well To worship shadows and adore false shapes , Send to me in the morning , and I’ll send it . And so , good rest .
As wretches have o’ernight That wait for execution in the morn .
Host , will you go
By my halidom , I was fast asleep .
Pray you , where lies Sir Proteus
Marry , at my house . Trust me , I think ’tis almost day .
Not so but it hath been the longest night That e’er I watched , and the most heaviest .
When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state , And trouble deaf heav n with my bootless cries , And look upon myself , and curse my fate , Wishing me like to one more rich in hope , Featured like him , like him with friends possessed , Desiring this man’s art , and that man’s scope , With what I most enjoy contented least Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising , Haply I think on thee , and then my state , Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth , sings hymns at heaven’s gate . For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
By this hand , I am . Good fool , some ink , paper , and light , and convey what I will set down to my lady . It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did .
I will help you to ’t . But tell me true , are you not mad indeed Or do you but counterfeit
Believe me , I am not . I tell thee true .
Nay , I’ll ne er believe a madman till I see his brains . I will fetch you light , and paper , and ink .
Fool , I’ll requite it in the highest degree . I prithee , be gone .
I am gone , sir , And anon , sir , I’ll be with you again , In a trice , Like to the old Vice , Your need to sustain , Who , with dagger of lath In his rage and his wrath , Cries Aha , to the devil , Like a mad lad , Pare thy nails , dad , Adieu , goodman devil .
The higher powers forbid
I say she’s dead I’ll swear’t . If word nor oath Prevail not , go and see if you can bring Tincture or lustre in her lip , her eye , Heat outwardly or breath within , I’ll serve you As I would do the gods . But , O thou tyrant Do not repent these things , for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee To nothing but despair . A thousand knees Ten thousand years together , naked , fasting , Upon a barren mountain and still winter In storm perpetual , could not move the gods To look that way thou wert .
Go on , go on Thou canst not speak too much I have deserved All tongues to talk their bitterest .
Say no more Howe’er the business goes , you have made fault I’ the boldness of your speech .
I am sorry for’t All faults I make , when I shall come to know them , I do repent . Alas I have show’d too much The rashness of a woman he is touch’d To the noble heart . What’s gone and what’s past help Should be past grief do not receive affliction At my petition I beseech you , rather Let me be punish’d , that have minded you Of what you should forget . Now , good my liege Sir , royal sir , forgive a foolish woman The love I bore your queen lo , fool again I’ll speak of her no more , nor of your children I’ll not remember you of my own lord , Who is lost too take your patience to you , And I’ll say nothing .
This is the hour that Madam Sylvia Entreated me to call and know her mind . There’s some great matter she’d employ me in . Madam , madam
Who calls
Your servant and your friend One that attends your ladyship’s command .
Sir Eglamour , a thousand times good morrow .
As many , worthy lady , to yourself . According to your ladyship’s impose , I am thus early come to know what service It is your pleasure to command me in .
O Eglamour , thou art a gentleman Think not I flatter , for I swear I do not Valiant , wise , remorseful , well accomplished . Thou art not ignorant what dear good will I bear unto the banished Valentine , Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio , whom my very soul abhors . Thyself hast loved , and I have heard thee say No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died , Upon whose grave thou vowedst pure chastity . Sir Eglamour , I would to Valentine , To Mantua , where I hear he makes abode And , for the ways are dangerous to pass , I do desire thy worthy company , Upon whose faith and honor I repose . Urge not my father’s anger , Eglamour , But think upon my grief , a lady’s grief , And on the justice of my flying hence To keep me from a most unholy match , Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues . I do desire thee , even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands , To bear me company and go with me If not , to hide what I have said to thee , That I may venture to depart alone .
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past , I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought , And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste . Then can I drown an eye unused to flow , For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night , And weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe , And moan th expense of many a vanished sight . Then can I grieve at grievances foregone , And heavily from woe to woe tell o er The sad account of fore bemoanèd moan , Which I new pay as if not paid before . But if the while I think on thee , dear friend , All losses are restored , and sorrows end .
This is the air , that is the glorious sun . This pearl she gave me , I do feel ’t and see ’t , And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus , Yet ’tis not madness . Where’s Antonio , then I could not find him at the Elephant . Yet there he was , and there I found this credit , That he did range the town to seek me out . His counsel now might do me golden service . For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error , but no madness , Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance , all discourse , That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad Or else the lady’s mad . Yet if ’twere so , She could not sway her house , command her followers , Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth , discreet , and stable bearing As I perceive she does . There’s something in ’t That is deceivable . But here the lady comes .
Thou didst speak but well When most the truth which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee . Prithee , bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son One grave shall be for both upon them shall The causes of their death appear , unto Our shame perpetual . Once a day I’ll visit The chapel where they lie , and tears shed there Shall be my recreation so long as nature Will bear up with this exercise , so long I daily vow to use it . Come and lead me Unto these sorrows . Exeunt
Madam , I pity much your grievances , Which , since I know they virtuously are placed , I give consent to go along with you , Recking as little what betideth me As much I wish all good befortune you . When will you go
This evening coming .
Where shall I meet you
At Friar Patrick’s cell , Where I intend holy confession .
I will not fail your ladyship . Good morrow , gentle lady .
Good morrow , kind Sir Eglamour .
Thy bosom is endearèd with all hearts Which I , by lacking , have supposèd dead And there reigns love , and all love’s loving parts , And all those friends which I thought burièd . How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stol n from mine eye As interest of the dead , which now appear But things removed that hidden in thee lie . Thou art the grave where buried love doth live , Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone , Who all their parts of me to thee did give That due of many now is thine alone . Their images I loved I view in thee , And thou , all they , hast all the all of me .
Blame not this haste of mine . If you mean well , Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by . There , before him And underneath that consecrated roof , Plight me the full assurance of your faith , That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace . He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note , What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth . What do you say
I’ll follow this good man , and go with you And , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
Then lead the way , good father and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine .
Thou art perfect then , our ship hath touch’d upon The deserts of Bohemia
Ay , my lord and fear We have landed in ill time the skies look grimly And threaten present blusters . In my conscience , The heavens with that we have in hand are angry And frown upon ’s .
Their sacred wills be done Go , get aboard Look to thy bark I’ll not be long before I call upon thee .
Make your best haste , and go not Too far i’ the land ’tis like to be loud weather Besides , this place is famous for the creatures Of prey that keep upon’t .
Go thou away I’ll follow instantly .
I am glad at heart To be so rid o’ the business .
Come , poor babe I have heard , but not believed , the spirits o’ the dead May walk again if such thing be , thy mother Appear’d to me last night , for ne’er was dream So like a waking . To me comes a creature , Sometimes her head on one side , some another I never saw a vessel of like sorrow , So fill’d and so becoming in pure white robes , Like very sanctity , she did approach My cabin where I lay thrice bow’d before me , And gasping to begin some speech , her eyes Became two spouts the fury spent , anon Did this break from her ‘Good Antigonus , Since fate , against thy better disposition , Hath made thy person for the thrower out Of my poor babe , according to thine oath , Places remote enough are in Bohemia , There weep and leave it crying and , for the babe Is counted lost for ever , Perdita , I prithee , call’t . For this ungentle business Put on thee by my lord , thou ne’er shalt see Thy wife Paulina more . ’ And so , with shrieks She melted into air . Affrighted much , I did in time collect myself and thought This was so and no slumber . Dreams are toys Yet for this once , yea , superstitiously , I will be squared by this . I do believe Hermione hath suffer’d death , and that Apollo would , this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes , it should here be laid , Either for life or death , upon the earth Of its right father . Blossom , speed thee well There lie , and there thy character there these Which may , if fortune please , both breed thee , pretty , And still rest thine . The storm begins poor wretch , That for thy mother’s fault art thus exposed To loss and what may follow Weep I cannot , But my heart bleeds and most accursed am I To be by oath enjoin’d to this . Farewell The day frowns more and more thou’rt like to have A lullaby too rough I never saw The heavens so dim by day . A savage clamour Well may I get aboard This is the chase I am gone for ever .
When a man’s servant shall play the cur with him , look you , it goes hard one that I brought up of a puppy , one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it . I have taught him , even as one would say precisely , Thus I would teach a dog . I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Sylvia from my master , and I came no sooner into the dining chamber , but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon’s leg . O , ’tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have , as one should say , one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed , to be , as it were , a dog at all things . If I had not had more wit than he , to take a fault upon me that he did , I think verily he had been hanged for ’t sure as I live , he had suffered for ’t . You shall judge . He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs , under the Duke’s table . He had not been there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him . Out with the dog says one What cur is that says another . Whip him out says the third . Hang him up says the Duke . I , having been acquainted with the smell before , knew it was Crab , and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs . Friend , quoth I you mean to whip the dog Ay , marry do I , quoth he . You do him the more wrong , quoth I ’twas I did the thing you wot of . He makes me no more ado , but whips me out of the chamber . How many masters would do this for his servant Nay , I’ll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen , otherwise he had been executed . I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed , otherwise he had suffered for ’t . Thou think’st not of this now . Nay , I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Sylvia . Did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale Didst thou ever see me do such a trick
Sebastian is thy name I like thee well , And will employ thee in some service presently .
In what you please . I’ll do what I can .
I hope thou wilt .
How now , you whoreson peasant , Where have you been these two days loitering
Marry , sir , I carried Mistress Sylvia the dog you bade me .
And what says she to my little jewel
Marry , she says your dog was a cur , and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present .
But she received my dog
No , indeed , did she not . Here have I brought him back again .
What , didst thou offer her this from me
Ay , sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace , and then I offered her mine own , who is a dog as big as ten of yours , and therefore the gift the greater .
Go get thee hence , and find my dog again , Or ne’er return again into my sight . Away , I say Stayest thou to vex me here
A slave , that still an end turns me to shame Sebastian , I have entertainèd thee , Partly that I have need of such a youth That can with some discretion do my business , For ’tis no trusting to yond foolish lout , But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior , Which , if my augury deceive me not , Witness good bringing up , fortune , and truth . Therefore know thou , for this I entertain thee . Go presently , and take this ring with thee .
If thou survive my well contented day , When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover , And shalt by fortune once more re survey These poor rude lines of thy deceasèd lover , Compare them with the bett ring of the time , And though they be outstripped by every pen , Reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme , Exceeded by the height of happier men . O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought Had my friend’s muse grown with this growing age , A dearer birth than this his love had brought To march in ranks of better equipage . But since he died and poets better prove , Theirs for their style I’ll read , his for his love .
Now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
Good Master Fabian , grant me another request .
Anything .
Do not desire to see this letter .
This is , to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again .
Belong you to the Lady Olivia , friends
Ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
I know thee well . How dost thou , my good fellow
Truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
Just the contrary . The better for thy friends .
No , sir , the worse .
How can that be
I would there were no age between sixteen and three and twenty , or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting Hark you now Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt this weather They have scared away two of my best sheep , which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master if any where I have them , ’tis by the seaside , browsing of ivy . Good luck , an’t be thy will what have we here Mercy on ’s , a barne a very pretty barne A boy or a child , I wonder A pretty one a very pretty one sure , some ’scape though I am not bookish , yet I can read waiting gentlewoman in the ’scape . This has been some stair work , some trunk work , some behind door work they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here . I’ll take it up for pity yet I’ll tarry till my son come he hallooed but even now . Whoa , ho , hoa
Deliver it to Madam Sylvia She loved me well delivered it to me .
It seems you loved not her , to leave her token . She’s dead , belike
Not so . I think she lives .
Alas
Why dost thou cry Alas
I cannot choose but pity her .
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her
Because methinks that she loved you as well As you do love your lady Sylvia . She dreams on him that has forgot her love You dote on her that cares not for your love . ’Tis pity love should be so contrary And thinking on it makes me cry alas
Well , give her that ring and therewithal This letter . That’s her chamber . Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture . Your message done , hie home unto my chamber , Where thou shalt find me , sad and solitary .
How many women would do such a message Alas , poor Proteus thou hast entertained A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs . Alas , poor fool , why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me Because he loves her , he despiseth me Because I love him , I must pity him . This ring I gave him when he parted from me , To bind him to remember my good will And now am I , unhappy messenger , To plead for that which I would not obtain , To carry that which I would have refused , To praise his faith , which I would have dispraised . I am my master’s true confirmèd love , But cannot be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself . Yet will I woo for him , but yet so coldly As , heaven it knows , I would not have him speed .
Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye , Kissing with golden face the meadows green , Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy , Anon permit the basest clouds to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face , And from the fórlorn world his visage hide , Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace . Ev n so my sun one early morn did shine With all triumphant splendor on my brow But out alack , he was but one hour mine The region cloud hath masked him from me now . Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth . Suns of the world may stain when heav‘n’s sun staineth .
Marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass . So that by my foes , sir I profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , I am abused . So that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives , why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
Why , this is excellent .
By my troth , sir , no though it please you to be one of my friends .
Thou shalt not be the worse for me there’s gold .
But that it would be double dealing , sir , I would you could make it another .
O , you give me ill counsel .
Put your grace in your pocket , sir , for this once , and let your flesh and blood obey it .
Well , I will be so much a sinner , to be a double dealer . There’s another .
Primo , secundo , tertio is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all . The triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of Saint Bennet , sir , may put you in mind one , two , three .
Hilloa , loa
What , art so near If thou’lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten , come hither . What ailest thou , man
I have seen two such sights , by sea and by land but I am not to say it is a sea , for it is now the sky betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin’s point .
Why , boy , how is it
I would you did but see how it chafes , how it rages , how it takes up the shore but that’s not the point . O , the most piteous cry of the poor souls sometimes to see ’em , and not to see ’em now the ship boring the moon with her main mast , and anon swallowed with yest and froth , as you’ld thrust a cork into a hogshead . And then for the land service , to see how the bear tore out his shoulder bone how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus , a nobleman . But to make an end of the ship , to see how the sea flap dragoned it but , first , how the poor souls roared , and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him , both roaring louder than the sea or weather .
Gentlewoman , good day I pray you be my means To bring me where to speak with Madam Sylvia .
What would you with her , if that I be she
If you be she , I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on .
From whom
From my master , Sir Proteus , madam .
O , he sends you for a picture
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day And make me travel forth without my cloak , To let base clouds o ertake me in my way , Hiding thy brav ry in their rotten smoke Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break , To dry the rain on my storm beaten face . For no man well of such a salve can speak That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace . Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief Though thou repent , yet I have still the loss . The offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offense’s cross . Ah , but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds , And they are rich , and ransom all ill deeds .
Ay , madam .
Ursula , bring my picture there .
Go , give your master this . Tell him from me , One Julia , that his changing thoughts forget , Would better fit his chamber than this shadow .
Madam , please you peruse this letter .
Pardon me , madam I have unadvised Delivered you a paper that I should not .
This is the letter to your ladyship .
I pray thee , let me look on that again .
It may not be . Good madam , pardon me .
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw . If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
Marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till I come again . I go , sir , but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness . But , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , I will awake it anon .
Here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
That face of his I do remember well . Yet , when I saw it last , it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war . A baubling vessel was he captain of , For shallow draught and bulk unprizable , With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet , That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him . What’s the matter
Orsino , this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy , And this is he that did the Tiger board When your young nephew Titus lost his leg . Here in the streets , desperate of shame and state , In private brabble did we apprehend him .
There , hold I will not look upon your master’s lines . I know they are stuffed with protestations And full of newfound oaths , which he will break As easily as I do tear his paper .
Madam , he sends your ladyship this ring .
The more shame for him that he sends it me , For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure . Though his false finger have profaned the ring , Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong .
She thanks you .
What sayst thou
I thank you , madam , that you tender her . Poor gentlewoman My master wrongs her much .
Dost thou know her
Almost as well as I do know myself . To think upon her woes I do protest That I have wept a hundred several times .
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her .
I think she doth , and that’s her cause of sorrow .
Is she not passing fair
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done . Roses have thorns , and silver fountains mud Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun , And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud . All men make faults , and even I in this , Authórizing thy trespass with compare , Myself corrupting , salving thy amiss , Excusing these sins more than these sins are . For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense Thy adverse party is thy advocate And gainst myself a lawful plea commence . Such civil war is in my love and hate That I an áccessory needs must be To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me .
Name of mercy , when was this , boy
He did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , But in conclusion put strange speech upon me . I know not what ’twas but distraction .
Now , now I have not winked since I saw these sights the men are not yet cold under water , nor the bear half dined on the gentleman he’s at it now .
Would I had been by , to have helped the old man
Notable pirate Thou saltwater thief , What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies , Whom thou , in terms so bloody and so dear , Hast made thine enemies
I would you had been by the ship side , to have helped her there your charity would have lacked footing .
Orsino , noble sir , Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me . Antonio never yet was thief or pirate , Though , I confess , on base and ground enough , Orsino’s enemy . A witchcraft drew me hither . That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem . A wreck past hope he was . His life I gave him and did thereto add My love , without retention or restraint , All his in dedication . For his sake Did I expose myself , pure for his love , Into the danger of this adverse town , Drew to defend him when he was beset , Where being apprehended , his false cunning , Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance , And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink , denied me mine own purse , Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before .
How can this be
When came he to this town
Heavy matters heavy matters but look thee here , boy . Now bless thyself thou mettest with things dying , I with things newborn . Here’s a sight for thee look thee , a bearing cloth for a squire’s child look thee here take up , take up , boy open’t . So , let’s see it was told me I should be rich by the fairies . This is some changeling open’t . What’s within , boy
You’re a made old man if the sins of your youth are forgiven you , you’re well to live . Gold all gold
This is fairy gold , boy , and ’twill prove so up with’t , keep it close home , home , the next way . We are lucky , boy and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy . Let my sheep go come , good boy , the next way home .
She hath been fairer , madam , than she is . When she did think my master loved her well , She , in my judgment , was as fair as you But since she did neglect her looking glass And threw her sun expelling mask away , The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lily tincture of her face , That now she is become as black as I .
How tall was she
About my stature for at Pentecost , When all our pageants of delight were played , Our youth got me to play the woman’s part , And I was trimmed in Madam Julia’s gown , Which servèd me as fit , by all men’s judgments , As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height . And at that time I made her weep agood , For I did play a lamentable part Madam , ’twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus’ perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress , movèd therewithal , Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow
Let me confess that we two must be twain , Although our undivided loves are one . So shall those blots that do with me remain Without thy help by me be borne alone . In our two loves there is but one respect , Though in our lives a separable spite , Which , though it alter not love’s sole effect , Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight . I may not evermore acknowledge thee , Lest my bewailèd guilt should do thee shame Nor thou with public kindness honor me , Unless thou take that honor from thy name . But do not so I love thee in such sort , As , thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
Today , my lord , and for three months before , No interim , not a minute’s vacancy , Both day and night did we keep company .
Here comes the Countess . Now heaven walks on earth . But for thee , fellow . Fellow , thy words are madness Three months this youth hath tended upon me But more of that anon . Take him aside .
What would my lord , but that he may not have , Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable Cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
Madam
Gracious Olivia
What do you say , Cesario Good my lord
My lord would speak . My duty hushes me .
If it be aught to the old tune , my lord , It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music .
Still so cruel
Still so constant , lord .
Go you the next way with your findings . I’ll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten they are never curst but when they are hungry if there be any of him left , I’ll bury it .
That’s a good deed . If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is , fetch me to the sight of him .
Marry , will I and you shall help to put him i’ the ground .
’Tis a lucky day , boy , and we’ll do good deeds on’t .
She is beholding to thee , gentle youth . Alas , poor lady , desolate and left I weep myself , to think upon thy words . Here , youth , there is my purse .
I give thee this For thy sweet mistress’ sake , because thou lov’st her . Farewell .
And she shall thank you for ’t , if e’er you know her . A virtuous gentlewoman , mild and beautiful I hope my master’s suit will be but cold , Since she respects my mistress’ love so much . Alas , how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture .
Let me see , I think If I had such a tire , this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flattered her a little , Unless I flatter with myself too much . Her hair is auburn , mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love , I’ll get me such a colored periwig . Her eyes are grey as glass , and so are mine . Ay , but her forehead’s low , and mine’s as high . What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself , If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come , shadow , come , and take this shadow up , For ’tis thy rival .
What , to perverseness You , uncivil lady , To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off rings have breathed out That e er devotion tendered what shall I do
Even what it please my lord that shall become him .
Why should I not , had I the heart to do it , Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death , Kill what I love A savage jealousy That sometimes savors nobly . But hear me this Since you to nonregardance cast my faith , And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favor , Live you the marble breasted tyrant still . But this your minion , whom I know you love , And whom , by heaven I swear , I tender dearly , Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite . Come , boy , with me . My thoughts are ripe in mischief I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love To spite a raven’s heart within a dove .
And I , most jocund , apt , and willingly , To do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
Where goes Cesario
After him I love More than I love these eyes , more than my life , More , by all mores , than e er I shall love wife . If I do feign , you witnesses above , Punish my life for tainting of my love
I , that please some , try all , both joy and terror Of good and bad , that makes and unfolds error , Now take upon me , in the name of Time , To use my wings . Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage , that I slide O’er sixteen years and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap , since it is in my power To o’erthrow law and in one self born hour To plant and o’erwhelm custom . Let me pass The same I am , ere ancient’st order was Or what is now received I witness to The times that brought them in so shall I do To the freshest things now reigning and make stale The glistering of this present , as my tale Now seems to it . Your patience this allowing , I turn my glass and give my scene such growing As you had slept between Leontes leaving , The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving That he shuts up himself , imagine me , Gentle spectators , that I now may be In fair Bohemia , and remember well , I mentioned a son o’ the king’s , which Florizel I now name to you and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita , now grown in grace Equal with wondering what of her ensues I list not prophecy but let Time’s news Be known when ’tis brought forth . A shepherd’s daughter , And what to her adheres , which follows after , Is the argument of Time . Of this allow , If ever you have spent time worse ere now If never , yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may .
As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of youth , So I , made lame by fortune’s dearest spite , Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth . For whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit , Or any of these all , or all , or more , Entitled in thy parts do crownèd sit , I make my love engrafted to this store . So then I am not lame , poor , nor despised , Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That I in thy abundance am sufficed , And by a part of all thy glory live . Look what is best , that best I wish in thee . This wish I have then ten times happy me .
O thou senseless form , Thou shalt be worshiped , kissed , loved , and adored And , were there sense in his idolatry , My substance should be statue in thy stead . I’ll use thee kindly for thy mistress’ sake , That used me so or else , by Jove I vow , I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee
Ay me , detested How am I beguiled
Who does beguile you Who does do you wrong
Hast thou forgot thyself Is it so long Call forth the holy father .
Come , away
Whither , my lord Cesario , husband , stay .
Husband
Ay , husband . Can he that deny
Her husband , sirrah
No , my lord , not I .
Alas , it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety . Fear not , Cesario . Take thy fortunes up . Be that thou know’st thou art , and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st .
O , welcome , father Father , I charge thee , by thy reverence , Here to unfold what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me .
How can my muse want subject to invent While thou dost breathe , that pour’st into my verse Thine own sweet argument , too excellent For every vulgar paper to rehearse O give thyself the thanks , if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight . For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee , When thou thyself dost give invention light Be thou the tenth muse , ten times more in worth Than those old nine which rhymers invocate And he that calls on thee , let him bring forth Eternal numbers to outlive long date . If my slight muse do please these curious days , The pain be mine , but thine shall be the praise .
I pray thee , good Camillo , be no more importunate ’tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to grant this .
It is sixteen years since I saw my country though I have for the most part been aired abroad , I desire to lay my bones there . Besides , the penitent king , my master , hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay , or I o’erween to think so , which is another spur to my departure .
As thou lovest me , Camillo , wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou , having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage , must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered , as too much I cannot , to be more thankful to thee shall be my study , and my profit therein the heaping friendships . Of that fatal country , Sicilia , prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent , as thou callest him , and reconciled king , my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented . Say to me , when sawest thou the Prince Florizel , my son Kings are no less unhappy , their issue not being gracious , than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues .
The sun begins to gild the western sky , And now it is about the very hour That Sylvia at Friar Patrick’s cell should meet me . She will not fail , for lovers break not hours Unless it be to come before their time , So much they spur their expedition .
See , where she comes . Lady , a happy evening
Amen , amen Go on , good Eglamour , Out at the postern by the abbey wall . I fear I am attended by some spies .
Fear not . The forest is not three leagues off . If we recover that , we are sure enough .
A contract of eternal bond of love , Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands , Attested by the holy close of lips , Strengthened by interchangement of your rings , And all the ceremony of this compact Sealed in my function , by my testimony , Since when , my watch hath told me , toward my grave I have traveled but two hours .
O thou dissembling cub What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow Farewell , and take her but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet .
My lord , I do protest
O , do not swear Hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
For the love of God , a surgeon Send one presently to Sir Toby .
What’s the matter
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too . For the love of God , your help I had rather than forty pound I were at home .
Who has done this , Sir Andrew
O how thy worth with manners may I sing , When thou art all the better part of me What can mine own praise to mine own self bring , And what is’t but mine own when I praise thee Even for this , let us divided live , And our dear love lose name of single one , That by this separation I may give That due to thee which thou deserv’st alone . O absence , what a torment wouldst thou prove , Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave To entertain the time with thoughts of love , Which time and thoughts so sweetly dost deceive , And that thou teachest how to make one twain , By praising him here who doth hence remain .
Sir , it is three days since I saw the prince . What his happier affairs may be , are to me unknown but I have missingly noted , he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared .
I have considered so much , Camillo , and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence , that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man , they say , that from very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his neighbours , is grown into an unspeakable estate .
I have heard , sir , of such a man , who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage .
That’s likewise part of my intelligence but , I fear , the angle that plucks our son thither . Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will , not appearing what we are , have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither . Prithee , be my present partner in this business , and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia .
Sir Proteus , what says Sylvia to my suit
O , sir , I find her milder than she was , And yet she takes exceptions at your person .
What , that my leg is too long
No , that it is too little .
I’ll wear a boot , to make it somewhat rounder .
But love will not be spurred to what it loathes .
What says she to my face
She says it is a fair one .
Nay , then , the wanton lies my face is black .
But pearls are fair , and the old saying is , Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes .
’Tis true , such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes , For I had rather wink than look on them .
How likes she my discourse
Ill , when you talk of war .
But well when I discourse of love and peace
But better , indeed , when you hold your peace .
What says she to my valor
O , sir , she makes no doubt of that .
She needs not , when she knows it cowardice .
What says she to my birth
The Count’s gentleman , one Cesario . We took him for a coward , but he’s the very devil incardinate .
My gentleman , Cesario
Od’s lifelings , here he is You broke my head for nothing , and that that I did , I was set on to do ’t by Sir Toby .
Why do you speak to me I never hurt you . You drew your sword upon me without cause , But I bespoke you fair and hurt you not .
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me . I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
Here comes Sir Toby halting . You shall hear more . But if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
How now , gentleman How is ’t with you
That’s all one has hurt me , and there’s the end on ’t . Sot , didst see Dick Surgeon , sot
Oh , he’s drunk , Sir Toby , an hour agone . His eyes were set at eight i the morning .
Then he’s a rogue , and a passy measures pavin . I hate a drunken rogue .
I willingly obey your command .
My best Camillo We must disguise ourselves .
Take all my loves , my love yea , take them all . What hast thou then more than thou hadst before No love , my love , that thou mayst true love call . All mine was thine before thou hadst this more . Then if for my love thou my love receivest , I cannot blame thee , for my love thou usest . But yet be blamed , if thou thyself deceivest By wilful taste of what thyself refusest . I do forgive thy robb ry , gentle thief , Although thou steal thee all my poverty And yet love knows it is a greater grief To bear love’s wrong than hate’s known injury . Lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows , Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes .
That you are well derived .
True from a gentleman to a fool .
Considers she my possessions
O , ay , and pities them .
Wherefore
That such an ass should owe them .
That they are out by lease .
Here comes the Duke .
How now , Sir Proteus how now , Thurio Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late
Not I .
Nor I .
Saw you my daughter
Neither .
Why then , She’s fled unto that peasant Valentine , And Eglamour is in her company . ’Tis true , for Friar Lawrence met them both As he in penance wandered through the forest . Him he knew well , and guessed that it was she , But , being masked , he was not sure of it . Besides , she did intend confession At Patrick’s cell this even , and there she was not . These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence . Therefore , I pray you , stand not to discourse , But mount you presently , and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua , whither they are fled . Dispatch , sweet gentlemen , and follow me .
Away with him Who hath made this havoc with them
I’ll help you , Sir Toby , because we’ll be dressed together .
Will you help An ass head , and a coxcomb , and a knave , a thin faced knave , a gull
Get him to bed , and let his hurt be looked to .
I am sorry , madam , I have hurt your kinsman , But , had it been the brother of my blood , I must have done no less with wit and safety . You throw a strange regard upon me , and by that I do perceive it hath offended you . Pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows We made each other but so late ago .
One face , one voice , one habit , and two persons A natural perspective , that is and is not
Antonio , O my dear Antonio How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee
Sebastian are you
Fear’st thou that , Antonio
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits When I am sometime absent from thy heart , Thy beauty and thy years full well befits , For still temptation follows where thou art . Gentle thou art , and therefore to be won Beauteous thou art , therefore to be assailed And when a woman woos , what woman’s son Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed Ay me , but yet thou might’st my seat forbear , And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth , Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee , Thine by thy beauty being false to me .
When daffodils begin to peer , With heigh the doxy over the dale , Why , then comes in the sweet o’ the year For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale . The white sheet bleaching on the hedge , With heigh the sweet birds , O , how they sing Doth set my pugging tooth on edge For a quart of ale is a dish for a king . The lark , that tirra lyra chants , With heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay , Are summer songs for me and my aunts , While we lie tumbling in the hay . I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore three pile but now I am out of service But shall I go mourn for that , my dear The pale moon shines by night And when I wander here and there , I then do most go right . If tinkers may have leave to live , And bear the sow skin budget , Then my account I well may , give , And in the stocks avouch it . My traffic is sheets when the kite builds , look to lesser linen . My father named me Autolycus who being , as I am , littered under Mercury , was likewise a snapper up of unconsidered trifles . With die and drab I purchased this caparison , and my revenue is the silly cheat . Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway beating and hanging are terrors to me for the life to come , I sleep out the thought of it . A prize a prize
How have you made division of yourself An apple , cleft in two , is not more twin Than these two creatures . Which is Sebastian
Most wonderful
Do I stand there I never had a brother Nor can there be that deity in my nature , Of here and everywhere . I had a sister , Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured . Of charity , what kin are you to me What countryman What name What parentage
Of Messaline . Sebastian was my father Such a Sebastian was my brother too , So went he suited to his watery tomb . If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us .
A spirit I am indeed , But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate . Were you a woman , as the rest goes even , I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say Thrice welcome , drownèd Viola
My father had a mole upon his brow .
And so had mine .
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years .
Why , this it is to be a peevish girl , That flies her fortune when it follows her . I’ll after , more to be revenged on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Sylvia .
And I will follow , more for Sylvia’s love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her .
And I will follow , more to cross that love Than hate for Sylvia , that is gone for love .
Let me see every ’leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn . what comes the wool to
If the springe hold , the cock’s mine .
I cannot do’t without counters . Let me see what am I to buy for our sheep shearing feast Three pound of sugar , five pound of currants , rice , what will this sister of mine do with rice But my father hath made her mistress of the feast , and she lays it on . She hath made me four and twenty nose gays for the shearers , three man song men all , and very good ones but they are most of them means and bases but one puritan amongst them , and he sings psalms to horn pipes . I must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates none , that’s out of my note nutmegs , seven a race or two of ginger , but that I may beg four pound of prunes , and as many of raisins o’ the sun .
O that ever I was born
I’ the name of me
That thou hast her it is not all my grief , And yet it may be said I loved her dearly That she hath thee is of my wailing chief , A loss in love that touches me more nearly . Loving offenders , thus I will excuse ye Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her And for my sake even so doth she abuse me , Suff ring my friend for my sake to approve her . If I lose thee , my loss is my love’s gain , And losing her , my friend hath found that loss Both find each other , and I lose both twain , And both for my sake lay on me this cross . But here’s the joy my friend and I are one Sweet flatt ry Then she loves but me alone .
Oh , that record is lively in my soul He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years .
If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurped attire , Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place , time , fortune , do cohere and jump That I am Viola . Which to confirm , I’ll bring you to a captain in this town , Where lie my maiden weeds , by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count . All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord .
So comes it , lady , you have been mistook . But nature to her bias drew in that . You would have been contracted to a maid Nor are you therein , by my life , deceived . You are betrothed both to a maid and man .
Boy , thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me .
And all those sayings will I overswear And those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbèd continent the fire That severs day from night .
Give me thy hand , And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds .
Come , come , Be patient . We must bring you to our captain .
A thousand more mischances than this one Have learned me how to brook this patiently .
Come , bring her away .
Where is the gentleman that was with her
Being nimble footed , he hath outrun us , But Moses and Valerius follow him . Go thou with her to the west end of the wood There is our captain . We’ll follow him that’s fled . The thicket is beset he cannot scape .
O , help me , help me pluck but off these rags and then , death , death
Alack , poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee , rather than have these off .
Come , I must bring you to our captain’s cave . Fear not he bears an honorable mind And will not use a woman lawlessly .
O sir , the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received , which are mighty ones and millions .
O Valentine , this I endure for thee
Alas , poor man a million of beating may come to a great matter .
I am robbed , sir , and beaten my money and apparel ta’en from me , and these detestable things put upon me .
What , by a horseman , or a footman
A footman , sweet sir , a footman .
Indeed , he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee if this be a horseman’s coat , it hath seen very hot service . Lend me thy hand , I’ll help thee come , lend me thy hand .
O , good sir , tenderly , O
Alas , poor soul
O , good sir , softly , good sir I fear , sir , my shoulder blade is out .
How now canst stand
When most I wink , then do mine eyes best see , For all the day they view things unrespected But when I sleep , in dreams they look on thee , And , darkly bright , are bright in dark directed . Then thou , whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadow’s form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light , When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so How would , I say , mine eyes be blessèd made By looking on thee in the living day , When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay All days are nights to see till I see thee , And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me .
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments . He , upon some action , Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit , A gentleman and follower of my lady’s .
He shall enlarge him .
Fetch Malvolio hither And yet , alas , now I remember me , They say , poor gentleman , he’s much distract . A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his . How does he , sirrah
Truly , madam , he holds Beelzebub at the staves end as well as a man in his case may do . Has here writ a letter to you . I should have given ’t you today morning , but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
Open ’t , and read it .
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman . By the Lord , madam ,
How now Art thou mad
No , madam , I do but read madness . An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow vox .
Prithee , read i thy right wits .
Softly , dear sir good sir , softly . You ha’ done me a charitable office .
Dost lack any money I have a little money for thee .
How use doth breed a habit in a man This shadowy desert , unfrequented woods , I better brook than flourishing peopled towns . Here can I sit alone , unseen of any , And to the nightingale’s complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes . O thou that dost inhabit in my breast , Leave not the mansion so long tenantless , Lest , growing ruinous , the building fall And leave no memory of what it was Repair me with thy presence , Sylvia Thou gentle nymph , cherish thy forlorn swain
No , good sweet sir no , I beseech you , sir I have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence , unto whom I was going I shall there have money , or any thing I want offer me no money , I pray you that kills my heart .
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you
What halloing and what stir is this to day These are my mates , that make their wills their law , Have some unhappy passenger in chase . They love me well , yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages . Withdraw thee , Valentine . Who’s this comes here
A fellow , sir , that I have known to go about with troll my dames I knew him once a servant of the prince I cannot tell , good sir , for which of his virtues it was , but he was certainly whipped out of the court .
His vices , you would say there’s no virtue whipped out of the court they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide .
Madam , this service I have done for you Though you respect not aught your servant doth To hazard life and rescue you from him That would have forced your honor and your love . Vouchsafe me , for my meed , but one fair look A smaller boon than this I cannot beg , And less than this , I am sure , you cannot give .
Vices , I would say , sir . I know this man well he hath been since an ape bearer then a process server , a bailiff then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son , and married a tinker’s wife within a mile where my land and living lies and , having flown over many knavish professions , he settled only in rogue some call him Autolycus .
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought , Injurious distance should not stop my way For then , despite of space , I would be brought From limits far remote where thou dost stay . No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee , For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be . But ah , thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone , But that so much of earth and water wrought , I must attend time’s leisure with my moan , Receiving naughts by elements so slow But heavy tears , badges of either’s woe .
Out upon him prig , for my life , prig he haunts wakes , fairs and bear baitings .
Very true , sir he , sir , he that’s the rogue that put me into this apparel .
So I do , madonna . But to read his right wits is to read thus . Therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia if you had but looked big and spit at him , he’ld have run .
I must confess to you , sir , I am no fighter I am false of heart that way and that he knew , I warrant him .
Read it you , sirrah .
How do you now
By the Lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it . Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship . I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on , with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame . Think of me as you please . I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury . The madly used Malvolio .
Did he write this
Ay , madam .
This savors not much of distraction .
See him delivered , Fabian bring him hither .
My lord so please you , these things further thought on , To think me as well a sister as a wife , One day shall crown the alliance on ’t , so please you , Here at my house and at my proper cost .
Sweet sir , much better than I was I can stand and walk I will even take my leave of you , and pace softly towards my kinsman’s .
Shall I bring thee on the way
No , good faced sir no , sweet sir .
Then fare thee well I must go buy spices for our sheep shearing .
Prosper you , sweet sir
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice . I’ll be with you at your sheep shearing too if I make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep , let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue
How like a dream is this I see and hear Love , lend me patience to forbear awhile .
O miserable , unhappy that I am
Unhappy were you , madam , ere I came But by my coming I have made you happy .
By thy approach thou mak’st me most unhappy .
And me , when he approacheth to your presence .
Had I been seizèd by a hungry lion , I would have been a breakfast to the beast Rather than have false Proteus rescue me . O , heaven be judge how I love Valentine , Whose life’s as tender to me as my soul And full as much for more there cannot be I do detest false , perjured Proteus . Therefore begone , solicit me no more .
What dangerous action , stood it next to death , Would I not undergo for one calm look O , ’tis the curse in love , and still approved , When women cannot love where they’re beloved
When Proteus cannot love where he’s beloved . Read over Julia’s heart , thy first , best love , For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths , and all those oaths Descended into perjury , to love me . Thou hast no faith left now , unless thou’dst two , And that’s far worse than none . Better have none Than plural faith , which is too much by one . Thou counterfeit to thy true friend
The other two , slight air and purging fire , Are both with thee , wherever I abide The first my thought , the other my desire , These present absent with swift motion slide . For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee , My life , being made of four , with two alone Sinks down to death , oppressed with melancholy Until life’s composition be recured By those swift messengers returned from thee , Who ev n but now come back again , assured Of thy fair health , recounting it to me . This told , I joy , but then no longer glad , I send them back again and straight grow sad .
Madam , I am most apt to embrace your offer . Your master quits you , and for your service done him , So much against the mettle of your sex , So far beneath your soft and tender breeding , And since you called me master for so long , Here is my hand . You shall from this time be Your master’s mistress .
Jog on , jog on , the foot path way , And merrily hent the stile a A merry heart goes all the day , Your sad tires in a mile a .
A sister You are she .
Is this the madman
Ay , my lord , this same . How now , Malvolio
Madam , you have done me wrong , Notorious wrong .
Have I , Malvolio No .
Lady , you have . Pray you , peruse that letter . You must not now deny it is your hand . Write from it if you can , in hand or phrase Or say ’tis not your seal , not your invention You can say none of this . Well , grant it then And tell me , in the modesty of honor , Why you have given me such clear lights of favor , Bade me come smiling and cross gartered to you , To put on yellow stockings , and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people
In love , Who respects friend
All men but Proteus .
Nay , if the gentle spirit of moving words Can no way change you to a milder form , I’ll woo you like a soldier , at arms’ end , And love you ’gainst the nature of love force ye .
O heaven
I’ll force thee yield to my desire .
Ruffian , let go that rude uncivil touch , Thou friend of an ill fashion
Valentine
Thou common friend , that’s without faith or love For such is a friend now . Treacherous man , Thou hast beguiled my hopes . Naught but mine eye Could have persuaded me . Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me . Who should be trusted , when one’s right hand Is perjured to the bosom Proteus , I am sorry I must never trust thee more , But count the world a stranger for thy sake . The private wound is deepest . O time most accurst , ’Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy picture’s sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right . My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie , A closet never pierced with crystal eyes But the defendant doth that plea deny , And says in him thy fair appearance lies . To cide this title is empanellèd A quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart , And by their verdict is determinèd The clear eye’s moiety and the dear heart’s part As thus mine eye’s due is thy outward part , And my heart’s right , thy inward love of heart .
These your unusual weeds to each part of you Do give a life no shepherdess , but Flora Peering in April’s front . This your sheep shearing Is as a meeting of the petty gods , And you the queen on’t .
Sir , my gracious lord , To chide at your extremes it not becomes me O , pardon , that I name them Your high self , The gracious mark o’ the land , you have obscured With a swain’s wearing , and me , poor lowly maid , Most goddess like prank’d up but that our feasts In every mess have folly and the feeders Digest it with a custom , I should blush To see you so attired , swoon , I think , To show myself a glass .
I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father’s ground .
Now Jove afford you cause To me the difference forges dread your greatness Hath not been used to fear . Even now I tremble To think your father , by some accident , Should pass this way as you did O , the Fates How would he look , to see his work so noble Vilely bound up What would he say Or how Should I , in these my borrow’d flaunts , behold The sternness of his presence
And , acting this in an obedient hope , Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned , Kept in a dark house , visited by the priest , And made the most notorious geck and gull That e er invention played on Tell me why .
Alas , Malvolio , this is not my writing , Though , I confess , much like the character . But out of question , ’tis Maria’s hand . And now I do bethink me , it was she First told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter . Prithee , be content . This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee But when we know the grounds and authors of it , Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause .
Good madam , hear me speak , And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour , Which I have wonder’d at . In hope it shall not , Most freely I confess , myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here , Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceived against him . Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance , In recompense whereof he hath married her . How with a sportful malice it was followed , May rather pluck on laughter than revenge , If that the injuries be justly weighed That have on both sides passed .
Alas , poor fool , how have they baffled thee
My shame and guilt confounds me . Forgive me , Valentine . If hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence , I tender ’t here . I do as truly suffer As e’er I did commit .
Then I am paid , And once again I do receive thee honest . Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven nor earth , for these are pleased . By penitence the Eternal’s wrath’s appeased And , that my love may appear plain and free , All that was mine in Sylvia I give thee .
O me unhappy
Look to the boy .
Why , boy Why , wag How now What’s the matter Look up . Speak .
O good sir , my master charged me to deliver a ring to Madam Sylvia , which , out of my neglect , was never done .
Where is that ring , boy
Here ’tis . This is it .
How Let me see . Why , this is the ring I gave to Julia .
O , cry you mercy , sir , I have mistook . This is the ring you sent to Sylvia .
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took , And each doth good turns now unto the other . When that mine eye is famished for a look , Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother , With my love’s picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart . Another time mine eye is my heart’s guest , And in his thoughts of love doth share a part . So either by thy picture or my love , Thyself away are present still with me For thou no farther than my thoughts canst move , And I am still with them , and they with thee Or if they sleep , thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart to heart’s and eye’s delight .
Apprehend Nothing but jollity . The gods themselves , Humbling their deities to love , have taken The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter Became a bull , and bellow’d the green Neptune A ram , and bleated and the fire robed god , Golden Apollo , a poor humble swain , As I seem now . Their transformations Were never for a piece of beauty rarer , Nor in a way so chaste , since my desires Run not before mine honour , nor my lusts Burn hotter than my faith .
O , but , sir , Your resolution cannot hold , when ’tis Opposed , as it must be , by the power of the king One of these two must be necessities , Which then will speak , that you must change this purpose , Or I my life .
Thou dearest Perdita , With these forced thoughts , I prithee , darken not The mirth o’ the feast . Or I’ll be thine , my fair , Or not my father’s . For I cannot be Mine own , nor any thing to any , if I be not thine . To this I am most constant , Though destiny say no . Be merry , gentle Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing That you behold the while . Your guests are coming Lift up your countenance , as it were the day Of celebration of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come .
Why , some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them . I was one , sir , in this interlude , one Sir Topas , sir , but that’s all one . By the Lord , fool , I am not mad . But do you remember Madam , why laugh you at such a barren rascal an you smile not , he’s gagged and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges .
I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you .
He hath been most notoriously abused .
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace .
He hath not told us of the captain yet . When that is known and golden time convents , A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls . Meantime , sweet sister , We will not part from hence . Cesario , come , For so you shall be , while you are a man . But when in other habits you are seen , Orsino’s mistress and his fancy’s queen .
But how cam’st thou by this ring At my depart I gave this unto Julia .
And Julia herself did give it me And Julia herself have brought it hither .
How Julia
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths And entertained ’em deeply in her heart . How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root O Proteus , let this habit make thee blush Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment , if shame live In a disguise of love . It is the lesser blot , modesty finds , Women to change their shapes than men their minds .
Than men their minds ’Tis true . O heaven Were man But constant , he were perfect . That one error Fills him with faults , makes him run through all th’ sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins . What is in Sylvia’s face but I may spy More fresh in Julia’s with a constant eye
Come , come , a hand from either . Let me be blest to make this happy close ’Twere pity two such friends should be long foes .
How careful was I , when I took my way , Each trifle under truest bars to thrust , That to my use it might unusèd stay From hands of falsehood , in sure wards of trust . But thou , to whom my jewels trifles are , Most worthy comfort , now my greatest grief , Thou best of dearest , and mine only care , Art left the prey of every vulgar thief . Thee have I not locked up in any chest , Save where thou art not , though I feel thou art , Within the gentle closure of my breast , From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stol n , I fear , For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear .
O lady Fortune , Stand you auspicious
See , your guests approach Address yourself to entertain them sprightly , And let’s be red with mirth .
Fie , daughter when my old wife lived , upon This day she was both pantler , butler , cook , Both dame and servant welcomed all , served all Would sing her song and dance her turn now here , At upper end o’ the table , now i’ the middle On his shoulder , and his her face o’ fire With labour and the thing she took to quench it , She would to each one sip . You are retired , As if you were a feasted one and not The hostess of the meeting pray you , bid These unknown friends to’s welcome for it is A way to make us better friends , more known . Come , quench your blushes and present yourself That which you are , mistress o’ the feast come on , And bid us welcome to your sheep shearing , As your good flock shall prosper .
Sir , welcome It is my father’s will I should take on me The hostess ship o’ the day .
When that I was and a little tiny boy , With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , A foolish thing was but a toy , For the rain it raineth every day . But when I came to man’s estate , With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate , For the rain it raineth every day . But when I came , alas to wive , With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , By swaggering could I never thrive , For the rain it raineth every day . But when I came unto my beds , With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , With toss pots still had drunken heads , For the rain it raineth every day . A great while ago the world begun , With hey , ho , the wind and the rain , But that’s all one , our play is done , And we’ll strive to please you every day .
Bear witness , heaven , I have my wish forever .
And I mine .
A prize , a prize , a prize
Forbear , forbear , I say it is my lord the Duke .
Your Grace is welcome to a man disgraced , Banishèd Valentine .
Sir Valentine
Yonder is Sylvia , and Sylvia’s mine .
Thurio , give back , or else embrace thy death . Come not within the measure of my wrath . Do not name Sylvia thine if once again , Verona shall not hold thee . Here she stands . Take but possession of her with a touch I dare thee but to breathe upon my love .
Sir Valentine , I care not for her , I . I hold him but a fool that will endanger His body for a girl that loves him not . I claim her not , and therefore she is thine .
The more degenerate and base art thou , To make such means for her as thou hast done And leave her on such slight conditions . Now , by the honor of my ancestry , I do applaud thy spirit , Valentine , And think thee worthy of an empress’ love . Know then , I here forget all former griefs , Cancel all grudge , repeal thee home again , Plead a new state in thy unrivalled merit , To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine , Thou art a gentleman , and well derived . Take thou thy Sylvia , for thou hast deserved her .
Against that time When I shall see thee frown on my defects Whenas thy love hath cast his utmost sum , Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass , And scarcely greet me with that sun , thine eye When love , converted from the thing it was , Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert , And this my hand against myself uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me , thou hast the strength of laws , Since why to love I can allege no cause .
You’re welcome , sir . Give me those flowers there , Dorcas . Reverend sirs , For you there’s rosemary and rue these keep Seeming and savour all the winter long Grace and remembrance be to you both , And welcome to our shearing
Shepherdess , A fair one are you well you fit our ages With flowers of winter .
Sir , the year growing ancient , Not yet on summer’s death , nor on the birth Of trembling winter , the fairest flowers o’ the season Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors , Which some call nature’s bastards of that kind Our rustic garden’s barren and I care not To get slips of them .
Wherefore , gentle maiden , Do you neglect them
For I have heard it said There is an art which in their piedness shares With great creating nature .
I thank Your Grace . The gift hath made me happy . I now beseech you , for your daughter’s sake , To grant one boon that I shall ask of you .
I grant it for thine own , whate’er it be .
These banished men , that I have kept withal , Are men endued with worthy qualities . Forgive them what they have committed here , And let them be recalled from their exile . They are reformèd , civil , full of good , And fit for great employment , worthy lord .
Thou hast prevailed I pardon them and thee . Dispose of them as thou know’st their deserts . Come , let us go . We will include all jars With triumphs , mirth , and rare solemnity .
And , as we walk along , I dare be bold With our discourse to make Your Grace to smile . What think you of this page , my lord
I think the boy hath grace in him . He blushes .
I warrant you , my lord , more grace than boy .
What mean you by that saying
Please you , I’ll tell you as we pass along , That you will wonder what hath fortunèd . Come , Proteus , ’tis your penance but to hear The story of your loves discoverèd . That done , our day of marriage shall be yours One feast , one house , one mutual happiness .
How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek Doth teach that ease and that repose to say , Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend . The beast that bears me , tired with my woe , Plods dully on to bear that weight in me , As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed , being made from thee . The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide , Which heavily he answers with a groan , More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind .
Say there be Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean so , over that art Which you say adds to nature , is an art That nature makes . You see , sweet maid , we marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock , And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race this is an art Which does mend nature , change it rather , but The art itself is nature .
So it is .
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors , And do not call them bastards .
I’ll not put The dibble in earth to set one slip of them No more than were I painted I would wish This youth should say ’twere well and only therefore Desire to breed by me . Here’s flowers for you Hot lavender , mints , savoury , marjoram The marigold , that goes to bed wi’ the sun And with him rises weeping these are flowers Of middle summer , and I think they are given To men of middle age . You’re very welcome .
I should leave grazing , were I of your flock , And only live by gazing .
Out , alas You’d be so lean , that blasts of January Would blow you through and through . Now , my fair’st friend , I would I had some flowers o’ the spring that might Become your time of day and yours , and yours , That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing O Proserpina , For the flowers now , that frighted thou let’st fall From Dis’s waggon daffodils , That come before the swallow dares , and take The winds of March with beauty violets dim , But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes Or Cytherea’s breath pale primroses That die unmarried , ere they can behold Bight Phoebus in his strength a malady Most incident to maids bold oxlips and The crown imperial lilies of all kinds , The flower de luce being one O , these I lack , To make you garlands of , and my sweet friend , To strew him o’er and o’er
Thus can my love excuse the slow offense Of my dull bearer , when from thee I speed From where thou art , why should I haste me thence Till I return , of posting is no need . O what excuse will my poor beast then find , When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur , though mounted on the wind In wingèd speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire , of perfect’st love being made , Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race , But love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilful slow , Towards thee I’ll run , and give him leave to go .
What , like a corse
No , like a bank for love to lie and play on Not like a corse or if , not to be buried , But quick and in mine arms . Come , take your flowers Methinks I play as I have seen them do In Whitsun pastorals sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition .
What you do Still betters what is done . When you speak , sweet . I’ld have you do it ever when you sing , I’ld have you buy and sell so , so give alms , Pray so and , for the ordering your affairs , To sing them too when you do dance , I wish you A wave o’ the sea , that you might ever do Nothing but that move still , still so , And own no other function each your doing , So singular in each particular , Crowns what you are doing in the present deed , That all your acts are queens .
O Doricles , Your praises are too large but that your youth , And the true blood which peepeth fairly through’t , Do plainly give you out an unstain’d shepherd , With wisdom I might fear , my Doricles , You woo’d me the false way .
So am I as the rich whose blessèd key Can bring him to his sweet up lockèd treasure , The which he will not every hour survey , For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure . Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare , Since seldom coming in the long year set , Like stones of worth they thinly placèd are , Or captain jewels in the carcanet . So is the time that keeps you as my chest , Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide , To make some special instant special blest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride . Blessèd are you whose worthiness gives scope , Being had , to triumph being lacked , to hope .
I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to’t . But come our dance , I pray Your hand , my Perdita so turtles pair , That never mean to part .
I’ll swear for ’em .
This is the prettiest low born lass that ever Ran on the green sward nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself , Too noble for this place .
He tells her something That makes her blood look out good sooth , she is The queen of curds and cream .
Come on , strike up
Mopsa must be your mistre marry , garlic , To mend her kissing with
Now , in good time
Not a word , a word we stand upon our manners . Come , strike up
Pray , good shepherd , what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter
They call him Doricles and boasts himself To have a worthy feeding but I have it Upon his own report and I believe it He looks like sooth . He says he loves my daughter I think so too for never gazed the moon Upon the water as he’ll stand and read As ’twere my daughter’s eyes and , to be plain , I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best .
What is your substance , whereof are you made , That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since everyone hath every one , one shade , And you , but one , can every shadow lend . Describe Adonis , and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you . On Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set , And you in Grecian tires are painted new . Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show , The other as your bounty doth appear , And you in every blessèd shape we know . In all external grace you have some part , But you like none , none you , for constant heart .
She dances featly .
So she does any thing though I report it , That should be silent if young Doricles Do light upon her , she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of .
O master , if you did but hear the pedlar at the door , you would never dance again after a tabour and pipe no , the bagpipe could not move you he sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s ears grew to his tunes .
He could never come better he shall come in . I love a ballad but even too well , if it be doleful matter merrily set down , or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably .
He hath songs for man or woman , of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he has the prettiest love songs for maids so without bawdry , which is strange with such delicate burthens of dildos and fadings , ‘jump her and thump her ’ and where some stretch mouthed rascal would , as it were , mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter , he makes the maid to answer ‘Whoop , do me no harm , good man ’ puts him off , slights him , with ‘Whoop , do me no harm , good man . ’
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem For that sweet odor which doth in it live . The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumèd tincture of the roses , Hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly , When summer’s breath their maskèd buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show , They live unwooed , and unrespected fade , Die to themselves . Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made And so of you , beauteous and lovely youth When that shall vade , my verse distills your truth .
This is a brave fellow .
Believe me , thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow . Has he any unbraided wares
He hath ribbons of an the colours i’ the rainbow points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle , though they come to him by the gro inkles , caddisses , cambrics , lawns why , he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses you would think a smock were a she angel , he so chants to the sleeve hand and the work about the square on’t .
Prithee bring him in and let him approach singing .
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ’s tunes .
You have of these pedlars , that have more in them than you’ld think , sister .
Ay , good brother , or go about to think .
Lawn as white as driven snow Cyprus black as e’er was crow Gloves as sweet as damask roses Masks for faces and for noses Bugle bracelet , necklace amber , Perfume for a lady’s chamber Golden quoifs and stomachers , For my lads to give their dears Pins and poking sticks of steel , What maids lack from head to heel Come buy of me , come come buy , come buy Buy lads , or else your lasses cry Come buy .
Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this pow rful rhyme , But you shall shine more bright in these conténts Than unswept stone , besmeared with sluttish time . When wasteful war shall statues overturn , And broils root out the work of masonry , Nor Mars his sword , nor war’s quick fire , shall burn The living record of your memory . Gainst death and all oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom . So till the judgment that yourself arise , You live in this , and dwell in lovers eyes .
If I were not in love with Mopsa , thou shouldst take no money of me but being enthralled as I am , it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves .
I was promised them against the feast but they come not too late now .
He hath promised you more than that , or there be liars .
He hath paid you all he promised you may be , he has paid you more , which will shame you to give him again .
Is there no manners left among maids will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces Is there not milking time , when you are going to bed , or kiln hole , to whistle off these secrets , but you must be tittle tattling before all our guests ’tis well they are whispering clamour your tongues , and not a word more .
I have done . Come , you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves .
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money
And indeed , sir , there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary .
Fear not thou , man , thou shalt lose nothing here .
I hope so , sir for I have about me many parcels of charge .
Sweet love , renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite , Which but today by feeding is allayed , Tomorrow sharpened in his former might . So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness , Tomorrow see again , and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness . Let this sad int rim like the ocean be Which parts the shore , where two contracted new Come daily to the banks , that when they see Return of love , more blest may be the view Else call it winter , which being full of care , Makes summer’s welcome , thrice more wished , more rare .
What hast here ballads
Pray now , buy some I love a ballad in print o’ life , for then we are sure they are true .
Here’s one to a very doleful tune , how a usurer’s wife was brought to bed of twenty money bags at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders’ heads and toads carbonadoed .
Is it true , think you
Very true , and but a month old .
Bless me from marrying a usurer
Here’s the midwife’s name to’t , one Mistress Tale porter , and five or six honest wives that were present . Why should I carry lies abroad
Pray you now , buy it .
Come on , lay it by and let’s first see more ballads we’ll buy the other things anon .
Here’s another ballad of a fish , that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the four score of April , forty thousand fathom above water , and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true .
Being your slave , what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend , Nor services to do , till you require . Nor dare I chide the world without end hour Whilst I , my sovereign , watch the clock for you , Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu . Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be , or your affairs suppose , But , like a sad slave , stay and think of nought Save , where you are , how happy you make those . So true a fool is love that in your will , Though you do anything , he thinks no ill .
Is it true too , think you
Five justices’ hands at it , and witnesses more than my pack will hold .
Lay it by too another .
This is a merry ballad , but a very pretty one .
Let’s have some merry ones .
Why , this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of ‘Two maids wooing a man ’ there’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it ’tis in request , I can tell you .
We can both sing it if thou’lt bear a part , thou shalt hear ’tis in three parts .
We had the tune on’t a month ago .
I can bear my part you must know ’tis my occupation have at it with you .
Get you hence , for I must go Where it fits not you to know .
Whither
O , whither
Whither
It becomes thy oath full well , Thou to me thy secrets tell .
That god forbid , that made me first your slave , I should in thought control your times of pleasure , Or at your hand th account of hours to crave , Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure . O let me suffer , being at your beck , Th imprisoned absence of your liberty And patience tame to sufferance bide each check , Without accusing you of injury . Be where you list , your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilege your time To what you will to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of self doing crime . I am to wait , though waiting so be hell , Not blame your pleasure , be it ill or well .
Me too , let me go thither .
Or thou goest to the orange or mill .
If to either , thou dost ill .
Neither .
What , neither
Neither .
Thou hast sworn my love to be .
Thou hast sworn it more to me Then whither goest say , whither
We’ll have this song out anon by ourselves my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk , and we’ll not trouble them . Come , bring away thy pack after me . Wenches , I’ll buy for you both . Pedlar , let’s have the first choice . Follow me , girls .
And you shall pay well for ’em .
Will you buy any tape , Or lace for your cape , My dainty duck , my dear a Any silk , any thread , Any toys for your head , Of the new’st and finest , finest wear a Come to the pedlar Money’s a medler . That doth utter all men’s ware a .
If there be nothing new , but that which is Hath been before , how are our brains beguiled , Which , lab ring for invention , bear amiss The second burthen of a former child O that recórd could with a backward look , Ev n of five hundred courses of the sun , Show me your image in some ántique book , Since mind at first in character was done , That I might see what the old world could say To this composèd wonder of your frame Whether we are mended , or where better they , Or whether revolution be the same . O sure I am the wits of former days To subjects worse have giv n admiring praise .
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore , So do our minutes hasten to their end , Each changing place with that which goes before , In sequent toil all forwards do contend . Nativity , once in the main of light , Crawls to maturity , wherewith being crowned , Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight , And time that gave doth now his gift confound . Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth , And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow . And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand , Praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand .
Master , there is three carters , three shepherds , three neat herds , three swine herds , that have made themselves all men of hair , they call themselves saltiers , and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols , because they are not in’t but they themselves are o’ the mind , if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling , it will please plentifully .
Away we’ll none on ’t here has been too much homely foolery already . I know , sir , we weary you .
You weary those that refresh us pray , let’s see these four threes of herdsmen .
One three of them , by their own report , sir , hath danced before the king and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier .
Leave your prating since these good men are pleased , let them come in but quickly now .
Why , they stay at door , sir .
O , father , you’ll know more of that hereafter .
Is it thy will thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken , While shadows like to thee do mock my sight Is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry , To find out shames and idle hours in me , The scope and tenor of thy jealousy O no thy love , though much , is not so great . It is my love that keeps mine eye awake , Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat , To play the watchman ever for thy sake . For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhére , From me far off , with others all too near .
Is it not too far gone ’Tis time to part them . He’s simple and tells much .
How now , fair shepherd Your heart is full of something that does take Your mind from feasting . Sooth , when I was young And handed love as you do , I was wont To load my she with knacks I would have ransack’d The pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it To her acceptance you have let him go And nothing marted with him . If your lass Interpretation should abuse and call this Your lack of love or bounty , you were straited For a reply , at least if you make a care Of happy holding her .
Old sir , I know She prizes not such trifles as these are The gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d Up in my heart which I have given already , But not deliver’d . O , hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir , who , it should seem , Hath sometime loved I take thy hand , this hand , As soft as dove’s down and as white as it , Or Ethiopian’s tooth , or the fann’d snow that’s bolted By the northern blasts twice o’er .
What follows this How prettily the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before I have put you out But to your protestation let me hear What you profess .
Do , and be witness to ’t .
And this my neighbour too
And he , and more Than he , and men , the earth , the heavens , and all That , were I crown’d the most imperial monarch , Thereof most worthy , were I the fairest youth That ever made eye swerve , had force and knowledge More than was ever man’s , I would not prize them Without her love for her employ them all Commend them and condemn them to her service Or to their own perdition .
Fairly offer’d .
This shows a sound affection .
But , my daughter , Say you the like to him
I cannot speak So well , nothing so well no , nor mean better By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his .
Sin of self love possesseth all mine eye And all my soul , and all my every part And for this sin there is no remedy , It is so grounded inward in my heart . Methinks no face so gracious is as mine , No shape so true , no truth of such account And for myself mine own worth do define , As I all other in all worths surmount . But when my glass shows me myself indeed , Beated and chopped with tanned antiquity , Mine own self love quite contrary I read Self so self loving were iniquity . Tis thee , myself , that for myself I praise , Painting my age with beauty of thy days .
Take hands , a bargain And , friends unknown , you shall bear witness to ’t I give my daughter to him , and will make Her portion equal his .
O , that must be I’ the virtue of your daughter one being dead , I shall have more than you can dream of yet Enough then for your wonder . But , come on , Contract us ’fore these witnesses .
Come , your hand And , daughter , yours .
Soft , swain , awhile , beseech you Have you a father
I have but what of him
Knows he of this
He neither does nor shall .
Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table . Pray you once more , Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs is he not stupid With age and altering rheums can he speak hear Know man from man dispute his own estate Lies he not bed rid and again does nothing But what he did being childish
Against my love shall be as I am now , With time’s injurious hand crushed and o erworn When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn Hath traveled on to age’s steepy night , And all those beauties whereof now he’s king Are vanishing or vanished out of sight , Stealing away the treasure of his spring For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding age’s cruel knife , That he shall never cut from memory My sweet love’s beauty , though my lover’s life . His beauty shall in these black lines be seen , And they shall live , and he in them still green .
No , good sir He has his health and ampler strength indeed Than most have of his age .
By my white beard , You offer him , if this be so , a wrong Something unfilial reason my son Should choose himself a wife , but as good reason The father , all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity , should hold some counsel In such a business .
I yield all this But for some other reasons , my grave sir , Which ’tis not fit you know , I not acquaint My father of this business .
Let him know’t .
He shall not .
Prithee , let him .
No , he must not .
Let him , my son he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice .
Come , come , he must not . Mark our contract .
Mark your divorce , young sir ,
When I have seen by time’s fell hand defaced The rich proud cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty towers I see down razed , And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore , And the firm soil win of the watery main , Increasing store with loss , and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of state , Or state itself confounded to decay , Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate , That time will come and take my love away . This thought is as a death , which cannot choose But weep to have that which it fears to lose .
Whom son I dare not call thou art too base To be acknowledged thou a sceptre’s heir , That thus affect’st a sheep hook And thou , fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft , who of force must know The royal fool thou copest with ,
O , my heart
I’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers , and made More homely than thy state . For thee , fond boy , If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this knack , as never I mean thou shalt , we’ll bar thee from succession Not hold thee of our blood , no , not our kin , Far than Deucalion off mark thou my words Follow us to the court . Thou churl , for this time , Though full of our displeasure , yet we free thee From the dead blow of it . And you , enchantment . Worthy enough a herdsman yea , him too , That makes himself , but for our honour therein , Unworthy thee , if ever henceforth thou These rural latches to his entrance open , Or hoop his body more with thy embraces , I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to’t .
Since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea , But sad mortality o ersways their power , How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea , Whose action is no stronger than a flower O how shall summer’s honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of batt ring days , When rocks impregnable are not so stout , Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays O fearful meditation Where , alack , Shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil or beauty can forbid O none , unless this miracle have might , That in black ink my love may still shine bright .
Even here undone I was not much afeard for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly , The selfsame sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage but Looks on alike . Will’t please you , sir , be gone I told you what would come of this beseech you , Of your own state take care this dream of mine , Being now awake , I’ll queen it no inch farther , But milk my ewes and weep .
Why , how now , father Speak ere thou diest .
I cannot speak , nor think Nor dare to know that which I know . O sir You have undone a man of fourscore three , That thought to fill his grave in quiet , yea , To die upon the bed my father died , To lie close by his honest bones but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest shovels in dust . O cursed wretch , That knew’st this was the prince , and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him Undone undone If I might die within this hour , I have lived To die when I desire .
Tired with all these , for restful death I cry , As to behold desert a beggar born , And needy nothing trimmed in jollity , And purest faith unhappily forsworn , And gilded honor shamefully misplaced , And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted , And right perfection wrongfully disgraced , And strength by limping sway disablèd , And art made tongue tied by authority , And folly , doctor like , controlling skill , And simple truth miscalled simplicity , And captive good attending captain ill . Tired with all these , from these would I be gone , Save that to die , I leave my love alone .
Why look you so upon me I am but sorry , not afeard delay’d , But nothing alter’d what I was , I am More straining on for plucking back , not following My leash unwillingly .
Gracious my lord , You know your father’s temper at this time He will allow no speech , which I do guess You do not purpose to him and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet , I fear Then , till the fury of his highness settle , Come not before him .
I not purpose it . I think , Camillo
Even he , my lord .
How often have I told you ’twould be thus How often said , my dignity would last But till ’twere known
It cannot fail but by The violation of my faith and then Let nature crush the sides o’ the earth together And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks From my succession wipe me , father I Am heir to my affection .
Ah , wherefore with infection should he live , And with his presence grace impiety , That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace itself with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek , And steal dead seeing of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow , since his rose is true Why should he live , now nature bankrupt is , Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins For she hath no exchequer now but his , And , proud of many , lives upon his gains . O him she stores , to show what wealth she had In days long since , before these last so bad .
Be advised .
I am , and by my fancy if my reason Will thereto be obedient , I have reason If not , my senses , better pleased with madness , Do bid it welcome .
This is desperate , sir .
So call it but it does fulfil my vow I needs must think it honesty . Camillo , Not for Bohemia , nor the pomp that may Be thereat glean’d , for all the sun sees or The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides In unknown fathoms , will I break my oath To this my fair beloved therefore , I pray you , As you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend , When he shall miss me , as , in faith , I mean not To see him any more , cast your good counsels Upon his passion let myself and fortune Tug for the time to come . This you may know And so deliver , I am put to sea With her whom here I cannot hold on shore And most opportune to our need I have A vessel rides fast by , but not prepared For this design . What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge , nor Concern me the reporting .
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn , When beauty lived and died as flow rs do now , Before these bastard signs of fair were born , Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden tresses of the dead , The right of sepulchers , were shorn away , To live a second life on second head Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay . In him those holy ántique hours are seen , Without all ornament , itself and true , Making no summer of another’s green , Robbing no old to dress his beauty new And him as for a map doth nature store , To show false art what beauty was of yore .
O my lord I would your spirit were easier for advice , Or stronger for your need .
Hark , Perdita .
I’ll hear you by and by .
He’s irremoveable , Resolved for flight . Now were I happy , if His going I could frame to serve my turn , Save him from danger , do him love and honour , Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king , my master , whom I so much thirst to see .
Now , good Camillo I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremony .
Sir , I think You have heard of my poor services , i’ the love That I have borne your father
Very nobly Have you deserved it is my father’s music To speak your deeds , not little of his care To have them recompensed as thought on .
Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend . All tongues , the voice of souls , give thee that due , Utt ring bare truth , ev n so as foes commend . Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same tongues that give thee so thine own In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown . They look into the beauty of thy mind , And that in guess they measure by thy deeds Then , churls , their thoughts To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds But why thy odor matcheth not thy show , The soil is this , that thou dost common grow .
Well , my lord , If you may please to think I love the king And through him what is nearest to him , which is Your gracious self , embrace but my direction If your more ponderous and settled project May suffer alteration , on mine honour , I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your highness where you may Enjoy your mistress , from the whom , I see , There’s no disjunction to be made , but by As heavens forefend your ruin marry her , And , with my best endeavours in your absence , Your discontenting father strive to qualify And bring him up to liking .
How , Camillo , May this , almost a miracle , be done That I may call thee something more than man And after that trust to thee .
Have you thought on A place whereto you’ll go
Not any yet But as the unthought on accident is guilty To what we wildly do , so we profess Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies Of every wind that blows .
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect , For slander’s mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspéct , A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air . So thou be good , slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater , being wooed of time For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love , And thou present’st a pure unstainèd prime . Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days , Either not assailed , or victor being charged Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise , To tie up envy evermore enlarged . If some suspéct of ill masked not thy show , Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe .
Then list to me This follows , if you will not change your purpose But undergo this flight , make for Sicilia , And there present yourself and your fair princess , For so I see she must be , ‘fore Leontes She shall be habited as it becomes The partner of your bed . Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness , As ‘twere i’ the father’s person kisses the hands Of your fresh princess o’er and o’er divides him ‘Twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one He chides to hell and bids the other grow Faster than thought or time .
Worthy Camillo , What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him
Sent by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts . Sir , The manner of your bearing towards him , with What you as from your father shall deliver , Things known betwixt us three , I’ll write you down The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say that he shall not perceive But that you have your father’s bosom there And speak his very heart .
No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vildest worms to dwell Nay , if you read this line , remember not The hand that writ it , for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot , If thinking on me then should make you woe . O if , I say , you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay , Do not so much as my poor name rehearse , But let your love even with my life decay , Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone .
I am bound to you There is some sap in this .
A cause more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves To unpath’d waters , undream’d shores , most certain To miseries enough no hope to help you , But as you shake off one to take another Nothing so certain as your anchors , who Do their best office , if they can but stay you Where you’ll be loath to be besides you know Prosperity’s the very bond of love , Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction alters .
One of these is true I think affliction may subdue the cheek , But not take in the mind .
Yea , say you so There shall not at your father’s house these seven years Be born another such .
My good Camillo , She is as forward of her breeding as She is i’ the rear our birth .
O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death , dear love , forget me quite , For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie , To do more for me than mine own desert , And hang more praise upon deceasèd I Than niggard truth would willingly impart . O lest your true love may seem false in this , That you for love speak well of me untrue , My name be buried where my body is , And live no more to shame nor me nor you . For I am shamed by that which I bring forth , And so should you , to love things nothing worth .
That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves , or none , or few , do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold , Bare ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang . In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west , Which by and by black night doth take away , Death’s second self , that seals up all in rest . In me thou seest the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie , As the deathbed whereon it must expire Consumed with that which it was nourished by . This thou perceiv’st , which makes thy love more strong , To love that well which thou must leave ere long .
I cannot say ’tis pity She lacks instructions , for she seems a mistress To most that teach .
Your pardon , sir for this I’ll blush you thanks .
My prettiest Perdita But O , the thorns we stand upon Camillo , Preserver of my father , now of me , The medicine of our house , how shall we do We are not furnish’d like Bohemia’s son , Nor shall appear in Sicilia .
My lord , Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there it shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine . For instance , sir , That you may know you shall not want , one word .
Ha , ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust , his sworn brother , a very simple gentleman I have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone , not a ribbon , glass , pomander , brooch , table book , ballad , knife , tape , glove , shoe tie , bracelet , horn ring , to keep my pack from fasting they throng who should buy first , as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture and what I saw , to my good use I remembered . My clown , who wants but something to be a reasonable man , grew so in love with the wenches’ song , that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket , it was senseless ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse I could have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing , no feeling , but my sir’s song , and admiring the nothing of it . So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoo bub against his daughter and the king’s son and scared my choughs from the chaff , I had not left a purse alive in the whole army .
But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away My life hath in this line some interest , Which for memorial still with thee shall stay . When thou reviewest this , thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee . The earth can have but earth , which is his due My spirit is thine , the better part of me . So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life , The prey of worms , my body being dead , The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife , Too base of thee to be rememb’red . The worth of that is that which it contains , And that is this , and this with thee remains .
Nay , but my letters , by this means being there So soon as you arrive , shall clear that doubt .
And those that you’ll procure from King Leontes
Shall satisfy your father .
Happy be you All that you speak shows fair .
Who have we here
We’ll make an instrument of this , omit Nothing may give us aid .
If they have overheard me now , why , hanging .
How now , good fellow why shakest thou so Fear not , man here’s no harm intended to thee .
I am a poor fellow , sir .
Why , be so still here’s nobody will steal that from thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly , thou must think there’s a necessity in’t , and change garments with this gentleman though the pennyworth on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , there’s some boot .
I am a poor fellow , sir . I know ye well enough .
So are you to my thoughts as food to life , Or as sweet seasoned show rs are to the ground And for the peace of you I hold such strife As ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found Now proud as an enjoyer , and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure Now counting best to be with you alone , Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure Sometime all full with feasting on your sight And by and by clean starvèd for a look Possessing or pursuing no delight , Save what is had or must from you be took . Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day , Or gluttoning on all , or all away .
Nay , prithee , dispatch the gentleman is half flayed already .
Are you in earnest , sir I smell the trick on’t .
Dispatch , I prithee .
Indeed , I have had earnest but I cannot with conscience take it .
Unbuckle , unbuckle .
Fortunate mistress , let my prophecy Come home to ye you must retire yourself Into some covert take your sweetheart’s hat And pluck it o’er your brows , muffle your face , Dismantle you , and , as you can , disliken The truth of your own seeming that you may For I do fear eyes over to shipboard Get undescried .
I see the play so lies That I must bear a part .
No remedy . Have you done there
Should I now meet my father , He would not call me son .
Why is my verse so barren of new pride , So far from variation or quick change Why with the time do I not glance aside To new found methods and to compounds strange Why write I still all one , ever the same , And keep invention in a noted weed , That every word doth almost tell my name , Showing their birth , and where they did proceed O know , sweet love , I always write of you , And you and love are still my argument . So all my best is dressing old words new , Spending again what is already spent For as the sun is daily new and old , So is my love still telling what is told .
Nay , you shall have no hat .
Come , lady , come . Farewell , my friend .
Adieu , sir .
O Perdita , what have we twain forgot Pray you , a word .
What I do next , shall be to tell the king Of this escape and whither they are bound Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after in whose company I shall review Sicilia , for whose sight I have a woman’s longing .
Fortune speed us Thus we set on , Camillo , to the sea side .
The swifter speed the better .
I understand the business , I hear it to have an open ear , a quick eye , and a nimble hand , is necessary for a cut purse a good nose is requisite also , to smell out work for the other senses . I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive . What an exchange had this been without boot What a boot is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this year connive at us , and we may do any thing extempore . The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity , stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal , I would not do’t I hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my profession .
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear , Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste The vacant leaves thy mind’s impr nt will bear , And of this book this learning mayst thou taste The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthèd graves will give thee memory Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know Time’s thievish progress to eternity . Look what thy memory cannot contain , Commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find Those children nursed , delivered from thy brain , To take a new acquaintance of thy mind . These offices , so oft as thou wilt look , Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book .
Aside , aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lane’s end , every shop , church , session , hanging , yields a careful man work .
See , see what a man you are now There is no other way but to tell the king she’s a changeling and none of your flesh and blood .
Nay , but hear me .
Nay , but hear me .
Go to , then .
She being none of your flesh and blood , your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him . Show those things you found about her , those secret things , all but what she has with her this being done , let the law go whistle I warrant you .
I will tell the king all , every word , yea , and his son’s pranks too who , I may say , is no honest man , neither to his father nor to me , to go about to make me the king’s brother in law .
Indeed , brother in law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce .
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse , And found such fair assistance in my verse , As every alien pen hath got my use , And under thee their poesy disperse . Thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing , And heavy ignorance aloft to fly , Have added feathers to the learnèd’s wing And given grace a double majesty . Yet be most proud of that which I compile , Whose influence is thine and born of thee . In others works thou dost but mend the style , And arts with thy sweet graces gracèd be But thou art all my art , and dost advance As high as learning my rude ignorance .
Very wisely , puppies
Well , let us to the king there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard .
I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master .
Pray heartily he be at palace .
Though I am not naturally honest , I am so sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar’s excrement .
How now , rustics whither are you bound
To the palace , an it like your worship .
Your affairs there , what , with whom , the condition of that fardel , the place of your dwelling , your names , your ages , of what having , breeding , and any thing that is fitting to be known , discover .
We are but plain fellows , sir .
A lie you are rough and hairy . Let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen , and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin , not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie .
Your worship had like to have given us one , if you had not taken yourself with the manner .
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid , My verse alone had all thy gentle grace , But now my gracious numbers are decayed , And my sick muse doth give another place . I grant , sweet love , thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen , Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of and pays it thee again . He lends thee virtue , and he stole that word From thy behavior beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek he can afford No praise to thee but what in thee doth live . Then thank him not for that which he doth say , Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay .
Are you a courtier , an’t like you , sir
Whether it like me or no , I am a courtier . Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings hath not my gait in it the measure of the court receives not thy nose court odor from me reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt Thinkest thou , for that I insinuate , or toaze from thee thy business , I am therefore no courtier I am courtier cap a pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon I command thee to open thy affair .
My business , sir , is to the king .
What advocate hast thou to him
I know not , an’t like you .
Advocate’s the court word for a pheasant say you have none .
None , sir I have no pheasant , cock nor hen .
How blessed are we that are not simple men Yet nature might have made me as these are , Therefore I will not disdain .
This cannot be but a great courtier .
His garments are rich , but he wears them not handsomely .
O how I faint when I of you do write , Knowing a better spirit doth use your name , And in the praise thereof spends all his might , To make me tongue tied speaking of your fame . But since your worth , wide as the ocean is , The humble as the proudest sail doth bear , My saucy bark , inferior far to his , On your broad main doth willfully appear . Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat , Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride Or , being wracked , I am a worthless boat , He of tall building and of goodly pride . Then , if he thrive and I be cast away , The worst was this my love was my decay .
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical a great man , I’ll warrant I know by the picking on’s teeth .
The fardel there what’s i’ the fardel Wherefore that box
Sir , there lies such secrets in this fardel and box , which none must know but the king and which he shall know within this hour , if I may come to the speech of him .
Age , thou hast lost thy labour .
Why , sir
The king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for , if thou beest capable of things serious , thou must know the king is full of grief .
So ’tis said , sir about his son , that should have married a shepherd’s daughter .
If that shepherd be not in hand fast , let him fly the curses he shall have , the tortures he shall feel , will break the back of man , the heart of monster .
Think you so , sir
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him , though removed fifty times , shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity , yet it is necessary . An old sheep whistling rogue a ram tender , to offer to have his daughter come into grace Some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him , say I draw our throne into a sheep cote all deaths are too few , the sharpest too easy .
Or I shall live , your epitaph to make , Or you survive , when I in earth am rotten , From hence your memory death cannot take , Although in me each part will be forgotten . Your name from hence immortal life shall have , Though I , once gone , to all the world must die . The earth can yield me but a common grave , When you entombèd in men’s eyes shall lie . Your monument shall be my gentle verse , Which eyes not yet created shall o er read , And tongues to be your being shall rehearse When all the breathers of this world are dead . You still shall live such virtue hath my pen Where breath most breathes , ev n in the mouths of men .
Has the old man e’er a son , sir , do you hear , an’t like you , sir
He has a son , who shall be flayed alive then ’nointed over with honey , set on the head of a wasp’s nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua vitae or some other hot infusion then , raw as he is , and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims , shall he be set against a brick wall , the sun looking with a southward eye upon him , where he is to behold him with flies blown to death . But what talk we of these traitorly rascals , whose miseries are to be smiled at , their offences being so capital Tell me , for you seem to be honest plain men , what you have to the king being something gently considered , I’ll bring you where he is aboard , tender your persons to his presence , whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits , here is man shall do it .
He seems to be of great authority close with him , give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear , yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand , and no more ado . Remember ‘stoned , ’ and ‘flayed alive . ’
I grant thou wert not married to my muse , And therefore mayst without attaint o erlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject , blessing every book . Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue , Finding thy worth a limit past my praise , And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the time bett ring days . And do so , love yet when they have devised What strainèd touches rhetoric can lend , Thou , truly fair , wert truly sympathized In true plain words by thy true telling friend . And their gross painting might be better used Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused .
An’t please you , sir , to undertake the business for us , here is that gold I have I’ll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you .
After I have done what I promised
Ay , sir .
Well , give me the moiety . Are you a party in this business
In some sort , sir but though my case be a pitiful one , I hope I shall not be flayed out of it .
O , that’s the case of the shepherd’s son hang him , he’ll be made an example .
Comfort , good comfort We must to the king and show our strange sights he must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else . Sir , I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed , and remain , as he says , your pawn till it be brought you .
I will trust you . Walk before toward the sea side go on the right hand I will but look upon the hedge and follow you .
We are blest in this man , as I may say , even blest .
Let’s before as he bids us he was provided to do us good .
If I had a mind to be honest , I see Fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth . I am courted now with a double occasion , gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement I will bring these two moles , these blind ones , aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing , let him call me rogue for being so far officious for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to’t . To him will I present them there may be matter in it .
I never saw that you did painting need , And therefore to your fair no painting set . I found , or thought I found , you did exceed The barren tender of a poet’s debt . And therefore have I slept in your report , That you yourself , being extant , well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short , Speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow . This silence for my sin you did impute , Which shall be most my glory , being dumb . For I impair not beauty , being mute , When others would give life , and bring a tomb . There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise .
Who is it that says most , which can say more Than this rich praise , that you alone are you In whose conf ne immurèd is the store Which should example where your equal grew Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory . But he that writes of you , if he can tell That you are you , so dignifies his story . Let him but copy what in you is writ , Not making worse what nature made so clear , And such a counterpart shall fame his wit , Making his style admired everywhere . You to your beauteous blessings add a curse , Being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse .
Sir , you have done enough , and have perform’d A saint like sorrow no fault could you make , Which you have not redeem’d indeed , paid down More penitence than done trespa at the last , Do as the heavens have done , forget your evil With them forgive yourself .
Whilst I remember Her and her virtues , I cannot forget My blemishes in them , and so still think of The wrong I did myself which was so much , That heirless it hath made my kingdom and Destroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man Bred his hopes out of .
True , too true , my lord If , one by one , you wedded all the world , Or from the all that are took something good , To make a perfect woman , she you kill’d Would be unparallel’d .
I think so . Kill’d She I kill’d I did so but thou strikest me Sorely , to say I did it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought now , good now , Say so but seldom .
My tongue tied muse in manners holds her still , While comments of your praise , richly compiled , Reserve their character with golden quill And precious phrase by all the muses filed . I think good thoughts , whilst other write good words , And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen To every hymn that able spirit affords , In polished form of well refinèd pen . Hearing you praised , I say Tis so , ’tis true , And to the most of praise add something more But that is in my thought , whose love to you , Though words come hindmost , holds his rank before . Then others for the breath of words respect , Me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect .
Not at all , good lady You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and graced Your kindness better .
You are one of those Would have him wed again .
If you would not so , You pity not the state , nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name consider little What dangers , by his highness’ fail of issue , May drop upon his kingdom and devour Incertain lookers on . What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well What holier than , for royalty’s repair , For present comfort and for future good , To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to’t
There is none worthy , Respecting her that’s gone . Besides , the gods Will have fulfill’d their secret purposes For has not the divine Apollo said , Is’t not the tenor of his oracle , That King Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found which that it shall , Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me who , on my life , Did perish with the infant . ’Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary , Oppose against their wills .
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse , Bound for the prize of all too precious you , That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse , Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew Was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write Above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead No , neither he , nor his compeers by night Giving him aid , my verse astonishèd . He , nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence , As victors of my silence cannot boast . I was not sick of any fear from thence But when your countenance filled up his line , Then lacked I matter , that enfeebled mine .
Care not for issue The crown will find an heir great Alexander Left his to the worthiest so his successor Was like to be the best .
Good Paulina , Who hast the memory of Hermione , I know , in honour , O , that ever I Had squared me to thy counsel then , even now , I might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes , Have taken treasure from her lips
And left them More rich for what they yielded .
Thou speak’st truth . No more such wives therefore , no wife one worse , And better used , would make her sainted spirit Again possess her corpse , and on this stage , Where we’re offenders now , appear soul vex’d , And begin , ‘Why to me ’
Had she such power , She had just cause .
She had and would incense me To murder her I married .
Farewell , thou art too dear for my possessing , And like enough thou know’st thy estimate . The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing My bonds in thee are all determinate . For how do I hold thee but by thy granting , And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting , And so my patent back again is swerving . Thyself thou gav’st , thy own worth then not knowing , Or me , to whom thou gav’st it , else mistaking So thy great gift , upon misprision growing , Comes home again , on better judgment making . Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter In sleep a king , but waking no such matter .
I should so . Were I the ghost that walk’d , I’ld bid you mark Her eye , and tell me for what dull part in’t You chose her then I’ld shriek , that even your ears Should rift to hear me and the words that follow’d Should be ‘Remember mine . ’
Stars , stars , And all eyes else dead coals Fear thou no wife I’ll have no wife , Paulina .
Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave
Never , Paulina so be blest my spirit
Then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath .
You tempt him over much .
Unless another , As like Hermione as is her picture , Affront his eye
Good madam ,
I have done . Yet , if my lord will marry , if you will , sir , No remedy , but you will , give me the office To choose you a queen she shall not be so young As was your former but she shall be such As , walk’d your first queen’s ghost , it should take joy To see her in your arms .
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light And place my merit in the eye of scorn , Upon thy side against myself I’ll fight , And prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn . With mine own weakness being best acquainted , Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults concealed , wherein I am attainted , That thou in losing me shalt win much glory . And I by this will be a gainer too , For bending all my loving thoughts on thee , The injuries that to myself I do , Doing thee vantage , double vantage me . Such is my love , to thee I so belong , That for thy right myself will bear all wrong .
My true Paulina , We shall not marry till thou bid’st us .
That Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath Never till then .
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel , Son of Polixenes , with his princess , she The fairest I have yet beheld , desires access To your high presence .
What with him he comes not Like to his father’s greatne his approach , So out of circumstance and sudden , tells us ’Tis not a visitation framed , but forced By need and accident . What train
But few , And those but mean .
His princess , say you , with him
Ay , the most peerless piece of earth , I think , That e’er the sun shone bright on .
O Hermione , As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone , so must thy grave Give way to what’s seen now Sir , you yourself Have said and writ so , but your writing now Is colder than that theme , ‘She had not been , Nor was not to be equall’d ’ thus your verse Flow’d with her beauty once ’tis shrewdly ebb’d , To say you have seen a better .
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault , And I will comment upon that offense . Speak of my lameness , and I straight will halt , Against thy reasons making no defense . Thou canst not , love , disgrace me half so ill , To set a form upon desired change , As I’ll myself disgrace , knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange , Be absent from thy walks , and in my tongue Thy sweet belovèd name no more shall dwell , Lest I , too much profane , should do it wrong And haply of our old acquaintance tell . For thee against myself I’ll vow debate , For I must ne er love him whom thou dost hate .
Pardon , madam The one I have almost forgot , your pardon , The other , when she has obtain’d your eye , Will have your tongue too . This is a creature , Would she begin a sect , might quench the zeal Of all professors else , make proselytes Of who she but bid follow .
How not women
Women will love her , that she is a woman More worth than any man men , that she is The rarest of all women .
Go , Cleomenes Yourself , assisted with your honour’d friends , Bring them to our embracement .
Still , ’tis strange He thus should steal upon us .
Had our prince , Jewel of children , seen this hour , he had pair’d Well with this lord there was not full a month Between their births .
Prithee , no more cease thou know’st He dies to me again when talk’d of sure , When I shall see this gentleman , thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may Unfurnish me of reason . They are come .
Then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now , Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross Join with the spite of fortune , make me bow , And do not drop in for an after loss Ah , do not , when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow , Come in the rearward of a conquered woe . Give not a windy night a rainy morrow , To linger out a purposed overthrow . If thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last , When other petty griefs have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortune’s might And other strains of woe , which now seem woe , Compared with loss of thee will not seem so .
Your mother was most true to wedlock , prince For she did print your royal father off , Conceiving you were I but twenty one , Your father’s image is so hit in you , His very air , that I should call you brother , As I did him , and speak of something wildly By us perform’d before . Most dearly welcome And your fair princess , goddess O , alas I lost a couple , that ’twixt heaven and earth Might thus have stood begetting wonder as You , gracious couple , do and then I lost All mine own folly the society , Amity too , of your brave father , whom , Though bearing misery , I desire my life Once more to look on him .
By his command Have I here touch’d Sicilia and from him Give you all greetings that a king , at friend , Can send his brother and , but infirmity Which waits upon worn times hath something seized His wish’d ability , he had himself The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his Measured to look upon you whom he loves He bade me say so more than all the sceptres And those that bear them living .
Some glory in their birth , some in their skill , Some in their wealth , some in their body’s force , Some in their garments , though new fangled ill , Some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse And every humor hath his adjunct pleasure , Wherein it finds a joy above the rest . But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best . Thy love is better than high birth to me , Richer than wealth , prouder than garments cost , Of more delight than hawks or horses be And having thee , of all men’s pride I boast Wretched in this alone , that thou mayst take All this away , and me most wretched make .
O my brother , Good gentleman the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me , and these thy offices , So rarely kind , are as interpreters Of my behind hand slackness . Welcome hither , As is the spring to the earth . And hath he too Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage , At least ungentle , of the dreadful Neptune , To greet a man not worth her pains , much less The adventure of her person
Good my lord , She came from Libya .
Where the warlike Smalus , That noble honour’d lord , is fear’d and loved
Most royal sir , from thence from him , whose daughter His tears proclaim’d his , parting with her thence , A prosperous south wind friendly , we have cross’d , To execute the charge my father gave me For visiting your highne my best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss’d Who for Bohemia bend , to signify Not only my success in Libya , sir , But my arrival and my wife’s in safety Here where we are .
But do thy worst to steal thyself away , For term of life thou art assurèd mine , And life no longer than thy love will stay , For it depends upon that love of thine . Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs , When in the least of them my life hath end . I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humor doth depend . Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind , Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie . O what a happy title do I find , Happy to have thy love , happy to die But what’s so blessèd fair that fears no blot Thou mayst be false , and yet I know it not .
The blessed gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here You have a holy father , A graceful gentleman against whose person , So sacred as it is , I have done sin For which the heavens , taking angry note , Have left me issueless and your father’s blest , As he from heaven merits it , with you Worthy his goodness . What might I have been , Might I a son and daughter now have look’d on , Such goodly things as you
Most noble sir , That which I shall report will bear no credit , Were not the proof so nigh . Please you , great sir , Bohemia greets you from himself by me Desires you to attach his son , who has His dignity and duty both cast off Fled from his father , from his hopes , and with A shepherd’s daughter .
Where’s Bohemia speak .
Here in your city I now came from him I speak amazedly and it becomes My marvel and my message . To your court Whiles he was hastening , in the chase , it seems , Of this fair couple , meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother , having both their country quitted With this young prince .
So shall I live , supposing thou art true , Like a deceived husband so love’s face May still seem love to me , though altered new Thy looks with me , thy heart in other place . For there can live no hatred in thine eye , Therefore in that I cannot know thy change . In many’s looks , the false heart’s history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange , But heav n in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell Whate er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be , Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell . How like Eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow , If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show .
Camillo has betray’d me Whose honour and whose honesty till now Endured all weathers .
Lay’t so to his charge He’s with the king your father .
Who Camillo
Camillo , sir I spake with him who now Has these poor men in question . Never saw I Wretches so quake they kneel , they kiss the earth Forswear themselves as often as they speak Bohemia stops his ears , and threatens them With divers deaths in death .
O my poor father The heaven sets spies upon us , will not have Our contract celebrated .
You are married
We are not , sir , nor are we like to be The stars , I see , will kiss the valleys first The odds for high and low’s alike .
My lord , Is this the daughter of a king
She is , When once she is my wife .
They that have pow r to hurt , and will do none , That do not do the thing they most do show , Who moving others are themselves as stone , Unmovèd , cold , and to temptation slow , They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces , And husband nature’s riches from expense . They are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence . The summer’s flow r is to the summer sweet , Though to itself it only live and die . But if that flow r with base infection meet , The basest weed outbraves his dignity . For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds .
That ‘once’ I see by your good father’s speed Will come on very slowly . I am sorry , Most sorry , you have broken from his liking Where you were tied in duty , and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty , That you might well enjoy her .
Dear , look up Though Fortune , visible an enemy , Should chase us with my father , power no jot Hath she to change our loves . Beseech you , sir , Remember since you owed no more to time Than I do now with thought of such affections , Step forth mine advocate at your request My father will grant precious things as trifles .
Would he do so , I’ld beg your precious mistress , Which he counts but a trifle .
Sir , my liege , Your eye hath too much youth in’t not a month ’Fore your queen died , she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on now .
I thought of her , Even in these looks I made .
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which , like a canker in the fragrant rose , Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose That tongue that tells the story of thy days , Making lascivious comments on thy sport , Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name blesses an ill report . O what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee , Where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot , And all things turns to fair that eyes can see Take heed , dear heart , of this large privilege The hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge .
But your petition Is yet unanswer’d . I will to your father Your honour not o’erthrown by your desires , I am friend to them and you upon which errand I now go toward him therefore follow me And mark what way I make come , good my lord .
Some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness , Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and faults are loved of more and less Thou mak’st faults graces that to thee resort . As on the finger of a thronèd queen The basest jewel will be well esteemed , So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated , and for true things deemed . How many lambs might the stern wolf betray , If like a lamb he could his looks translate How many gazers mightst thou lead away , If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state But do not so . I love thee in such sort , As thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
Beseech you , sir , were you present at this relation
I was by at the opening of the fardel , heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon , after a little amazedness , we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought I heard the shepherd say , he found the child .
I would most gladly know the issue of it .
I make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost , with staring on one another , to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness , language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed , or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder , that knew no more but seeing , could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one , it must needs be .
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more . The news , Rogero
How like a winter hath my absence been From thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I felt , what dark days seen What old December’s bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was summer’s time , The teeming autumn big with rich increase , Bearing the wanton burthen of the prime , Like widowed wombs after their lords decease . Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans , and unfathered fruit . For summer and his pleasures wait on thee , And thou away , the very birds are mute . Or if they sing , ’tis with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale , dreading the winter’s near .
Nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the king’s daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad makers cannot be able to express it .
Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward he can deliver you more . How goes it now , sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale , that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir
Most true , if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear you’ll swear you see , there is such unity in the proofs . The mantle of Queen Hermione’s , her jewel about the neck of it , the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character , the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother , the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding , and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter . Did you see the meeting of the two kings
No .
Then have you lost a sight , which was to be seen , cannot be spoken of . There might you have beheld one joy crown another , so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them , for their joy waded in tears . There was casting up of eyes , holding up of hands , with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment , not by favour . Our king , being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter , as if that joy were now become a loss , cries ‘O , thy mother , thy mother ’ then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son in law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd , which stands by like a weather bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns . I never heard of such another encounter , which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it .
From you have I been absent in the spring , When proud pied April , dressed in all his trim , Hath put a spirit of youth in everything , That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him . Yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell Of different flow rs in odor and in hue , Could make me any summer’s story tell , Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew . Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white , Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose They were but sweet , but figures of delight , Drawn after you , you pattern of all those . Yet seemed it winter still , and , you away , As with your shadow I with these did play .
What , pray you , became of Antigonus , that carried hence the child
Like an old tale still , which will have matter to rehearse , though credit be asleep and not an ear open . He was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherd’s son who has not only his innocence , which seems much , to justify him , but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows .
What became of his bark and his followers
Wrecked the same instant of their master’s death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found . But O , the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband , another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth , and so locks her in embracing , as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing .
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted .
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes , caught the water though not the fish , was when , at the relation of the queen’s death , with the manner how she came to’t bravely confessed and lamented by the king , how attentiveness wounded his daughter till , from one sign of dolour to another , she did , with an ‘Alas , ’ I would fain say , bleed tears , for I am sure my heart wept blood . Who was most marble there changed colour some swooned , all sorrowed if all the world could have seen ’t , the woe had been universal .
The forward violet thus did I chide Sweet thief , whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells , If not from my love’s breath The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed . The lily I condemnèd for thy hand , And buds of marjoram had stol n thy hair The roses fearfully on thorns did stand , One blushing shame , another white despair A third , nor red nor white , had stol n of both , And to his robb ry had annexed thy breath But for his theft , in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker ate him up to death . More flow rs I noted , yet I none could see But sweet or color it had stol n from thee .
Are they returned to the court
No the princess hearing of her mother’s statue , which is in the keeping of Paulina , a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master , Julio Romano , who , had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work , would beguile Nature of her custom , so perfectly he is her ape he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone , and there they intend to sup .
I thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day , ever since the death of Hermione , visited that removed house . Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge . Let’s along .
Now , had I not the dash of my former life in me , would preferment drop on my head . I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he at that time , overfond of the shepherd’s daughter , so he then took her to be , who began to be much sea sick , and himself little better , extremity of weather continuing , this mystery remained undiscovered . But ’tis all one to me for had I been the finder out of this secret , it would not have relished among my other discredits .
Where art thou , Muse , that thou forget’st so long To speak of that which gives thee all thy might Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song , Dark ning thy pow r to lend base subjects light Return , forgetful Muse , and straight redeem In gentle numbers time so idly spent Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem , And gives thy pen both skill and argument . Rise , resty Muse my love’s sweet face survey , If time have any wrinkle graven there If any , be a satire to decay , And make time’s spoils despisèd everywhere . Give my love fame faster than time wastes life So thou prevent’st his scythe and crookèd knife .
Here come those I have done good to against my will , and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune .
Come , boy I am past more children , but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born .
You are well met , sir . You denied to fight with me this other day , because I was no gentleman born . See you these clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born give me the lie , do , and try whether I am not now a gentleman born .
I know you are now , sir , a gentleman born .
Ay , and have been so any time these four hours .
And so have I , boy .
So you have but I was a gentleman born before my father for the king’s son took me by the hand , and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept , and there was the first gentleman like tears that ever we shed .
We may live , son , to shed many more .
Ay or else ’twere hard luck , being in so preposterous estate as we are .
I humbly beseech you , sir , to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master .
Prithee , son , do for we must be gentle , now we are gentlemen .
Thou wilt amend thy life
Ay , an it like your good worship .
Give me thy hand I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia .
You may say it , but not swear it .
Not swear it , now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins say it , I’ll swear it .
How if it be false , son
If it be ne’er so false , a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend and I’ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but I’ll swear it , and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands .
I will prove so , sir , to my power .
Ay , by any means prove a tall fellow if I do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk , not being a tall fellow , trust me not . Hark the kings and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the queen’s picture . Come , follow us we’ll be thy good masters .
O truant Muse , what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed Both truth and beauty on my love depends So dost thou too , and therein dignified . Make answer , Muse wilt thou not haply say Truth needs no color , with his color fixed , Beauty no pencil , beauty’s truth to lay But best is best if never intermixed Because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb Excuse not silence so , for ’t lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb , And to be praised of ages yet to be . Then do thy office , Muse . I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now .
My love is strengthened , though more weak in seeming I love not less , though less the show appear . That love is merchandised whose rich esteeming The owner’s tongue doth publish everywhere . Our love was new , and then but in the spring , When I was wont to greet it with my lays , As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing , And stops his pipe in growth of riper days . Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night , But that wild music burthens every bough , And sweets grown common lose their dear delight . Therefore , like her , I sometime hold my tongue , Because I would not dull you with my song .
O grave and good Paulina , the great comfort That I have had of thee
What , sovereign sir , I did not well I meant well . All my services You have paid home but that you have vouchsafed , With your crown’d brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms , my poor house to visit , It is a surplus of your grace , which never My life may last to answer .
O Paulina , We honour you with trouble but we came To see the statue of our queen your gallery Have we pass’d through , not without much content In many singularities but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon , The statue of her mother .
As she lived peerless , So her dead likeness , I do well believe , Excels whatever yet you look’d upon Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it Lonely , apart . But here it is prepare To see the life as lively mock’d as ever Still sleep mock’d death behold , and say ’tis well .
Alack , what poverty my muse brings forth , That having such a scope to show her pride , The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass , and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite , Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace . Were it not sinful then , striving to mend , To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell And more , much more than in my verse can sit Your own glass shows you , when you look in it .
I like your silence , it the more shows off Your wonder but yet speak first , you , my liege , Comes it not something near
Her natural posture Chide me , dear stone , that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione or rather , thou art she In thy not chiding , for she was as tender As infancy and grace . But yet , Paulina , Hermione was not so much wrinkled , nothing So aged as this seems .
O , not by much .
So much the more our carver’s excellence Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she lived now .
As now she might have done , So much to my good comfort , as it is Now piercing to my soul . O , thus she stood , Even with such life of majesty , warm life , As now it coldly stands , when first I woo’d her I am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it O royal piece , There’s magic in thy majesty , which has My evils conjured to remembrance and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits , Standing like stone with thee .
To me , fair friend , you never can be old , For as you were when first your eye I eyed , Such seems your beauty still . Three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen Three April pérfumes in three hot Junes burned , Since first I saw you fresh , which yet are green . Ah yet doth beauty , like a dial hand , Steal from his figure , and no pace perceived So your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand , Hath motion , and mine eye may be deceived . For fear of which , hear this , thou age unbred Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead .
And give me leave , And do not say ’tis superstition , that I kneel and then implore her blessing . Lady , Dear queen , that ended when I but began , Give me that hand of yours to kiss .
O , patience The statue is but newly fix’d , the colour’s Not dry .
My lord , your sorrow was too sore laid on , Which sixteen winters cannot blow away , So many summers dry scarce any joy Did ever so long live no sorrow But kill’d itself much sooner .
Dear my brother , Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself .
Indeed , my lord , If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you , for the stone is mine I’ld not have show’d it .
Do not draw the curtain .
No longer shall you gaze on’t , lest your fancy May think anon it moves .
Let not my love be called idolatry , Nor my belovèd as an idol show , Since all alike my songs and praises be To one , of one , still such , and ever so . Kind is my love today , tomorrow kind , Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined , One thing expressing , leaves out difference . Fair , kind , and true is all my argument , Fair , kind , and true , varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one , which wondrous scope affords . Fair , kind , and true have often lived alone , Which three , till now , never kept seat in one .
Let be , let be . Would I were dead , but that , methinks , already What was he that did make it See , my lord , Would you not deem it breathed and that those veins Did verily bear blood
Masterly done The very life seems warm upon her lip .
The fixture of her eye has motion in’t , As we are mock’d with art .
I’ll draw the curtain My lord’s almost so far transported that He’ll think anon it lives .
O sweet Paulina , Make me to think so twenty years together No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness . Let ’t alone .
I am sorry , sir , I have thus far stirr’d you but I could afflict you farther .
Do , Paulina For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort . Still , methinks , There is an air comes from her what fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me , For I will kiss her .
When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights , Then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best , Of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow , I see their ántique pen would have expressed Ev n such a beauty as you master now . So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time , all you prefiguring , And for they looked but with divining eyes , They had not skill enough your worth to sing . For we which now behold these present days , Have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise .
Good my lord , forbear The ruddiness upon her lip is wet You’ll mar it if you kiss it , stain your own With oily painting . Shall I draw the curtain
No , not these twenty years .
So long could I Stand by , a looker on .
Either forbear , Quit presently the chapel , or resolve you For more amazement . If you can behold it , I’ll make the statue move indeed , descend And take you by the hand but then you’ll think Which I protest against I am assisted By wicked powers .
What you can make her do , I am content to look on what to speak , I am content to hear for ’tis as easy To make her speak as move .
It is required You do awake your faith . Then all stand still On those that think it is unlawful business I am about , let them depart .
Proceed No foot shall stir .
Not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come , Can yet the lease of my true love control , Supposed as forfeit to a cónfined doom . The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own preságe Incertainties now crown themselves assured , And peace proclaims olives of endless age . Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh , and death to me subscribes , Since spite of him I’ll live in this poor rhyme , While he insults o er dull and speechless tribes . And thou in this shalt find thy monument , When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent .
Music , awake her strike
’Tis time descend be stone no more approach Strike all that look upon with marvel . Come , I’ll fill your grave up stir , nay , come away , Bequeath to death your numbness , for from him Dear life redeems you . You perceive she stirs
Start not her actions shall be holy as You hear my spell is lawful do not shun her Until you see her die again for then You kill her double . Nay , present your hand When she was young you woo’d her now in age Is she become the suitor
O , she’s warm If this be magic , let it be an art Lawful as eating .
She embraces him .
She hangs about his neck If she pertain to life let her speak too .
Ay , and make’t manifest where she has lived , Or how stolen from the dead .
That she is living , Were it but told you , should be hooted at Like an old tale but it appears she lives , Though yet she speak not . Mark a little while . Please you to interpose , fair madam kneel And pray your mother’s blessing . Turn , good lady Our Perdita is found .
What’s in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit What’s new to speak , what now to register , That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing , sweet boy but yet , like prayers divine , I must each day say o er the very same , Counting no old thing old , thou mine , I thine , Ev n as when first I hallowed thy fair name . So that eternal love in love’s fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age , Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place , But makes antiquity for aye his page , Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead .
You gods , look down And from your sacred vials pour your graces Upon my daughter’s head Tell me , mine own . Where hast thou been preserved where lived how found Thy father’s court for thou shalt hear that I , Knowing by Paulina that the oracle Gave hope thou wast in being , have preserved Myself to see the issue .
There’s time enough for that Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation . Go together , You precious winners all your exultation Partake to every one . I , an old turtle , Will wing me to some wither’d bough and there My mate , that’s never to be found again , Lament till I am lost .
O , peace , Paulina Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent , As I by thine a wife this is a match , And made between’s by vows . Thou hast found mine But how , is to be question’d for I saw her , As I thought , dead , and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave . I’ll not seek far For him , I partly know his mind to find thee An honourable husband . Come , Camillo , And take her by the hand , whose worth and honesty Is richly noted and here justified By us , a pair of kings . Let’s from this place . What look upon my brother both your pardons , That e’er I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion . This is your son in law , And son unto the king , who , heavens directing , Is troth plight to your daughter . Good Paulina , Lead us from hence , where we may leisurely Each one demand an answer to his part Perform’d in this wide gap of time since first We were dissever’d hastily lead away .
O never say that I was false of heart , Though absence seemed my flame to qualify . As easy might I from myself depart As from my soul , which in thy breast doth lie . That is my home of love if I have ranged , Like him that travels I return again , Just to the time , not with the time exchanged , So that myself bring water for my stain . Never believe , though in my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood , That it could so preposterously be stained To leave for nothing all thy sum of good . For nothing this wide universe I call , Save thou , my rose in it thou art my all .
Alas ’tis true , I have gone here and there , And made myself a motley to the view , Gored mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear , Made old offenses of affections new . Most true it is that I have looked on truth Askance and strangely but by all above , These blenches gave my heart another youth , And worse essays proved thee my best of love . Now all is done , save what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof , to try an older friend , A god in love , to whom I am confined . Then give me welcome , next my heav n the best , Ev n to thy pure and most most loving breast .
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide , The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds , That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds . Thence comes it that my name receives a brand , And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in , like the dyer’s hand Pity me then , and wish I were renewed , Whilst like a willing patient I will drink Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think , Nor double penance , to correct correction . Pity me then , dear friend , and I assure ye , Ev n that your pity is enough to cure me .
Your love and pity doth th impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow For what care I who calls me well or ill , So you o er green my bad , my good allow You are my all the world , and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue None else to me , nor I to none alive , That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong . In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others voices , that my adder’s sense To critic and to flatt’rer stoppèd are . Mark how with my neglect I do dispense You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks y are dead .
Since I left you , mine eye is in my mind , And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function , and is partly blind , Seems seeing , but effectually is out For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird , of flow r , or shape which it doth latch . Of his quick objects hath the mind no part , Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch For if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight , The most sweet favor or deformèd’st creature , The mountain , or the sea , the day , or night , The crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature . Incapable of more , replete with you , My most true mind thus makes mine untrue .
Or whether doth my mind , being crowned with you , Drink up the monarch’s plague , this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true , And that your love taught it this alchemy , To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble , Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble O ’tis the first ’tis flattery in my seeing , And my great mind most kingly drinks it up . Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing , And to his palate doth prepare the cup . If it be poisoned , ’tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin .
Those lines that I before have writ do lie , Ev n those that said I could not love you dearer . Yet then my judgment knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer . But reck ning time , whose millioned accidents Creep in ’twixt vows , and change decrees of kings , Tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp’st intents , Divert strong minds to the course of alt ring things . Alas , why , fearing of time’s tyranny , Might I not then say , Now I love you best , When I was certain o er incertainty , Crowning the present , doubting of the rest Love is a babe then might I not say so , To give full growth to that which still doth grow
Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments . Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds , Or bends with the remover to remove . O no , it is an ever fixèd mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wand ring bark , Whose worth’s unknown , although his height be taken . Love’s not time’s fool , though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle’s compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks , But bears it out even to the edge of doom . If this be error and upon me proved , I never writ , nor no man ever loved .
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all Wherein I should your great deserts repay , Forgot upon your dearest love to call , Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown minds , And giv n to time your own dear purchased right That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight . Book both my willfulness and errors down , And on just proof surmise accumulate . Bring me within the level of your frown , But shoot not at me in your wakened hate , Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love .
Like as to make our appetites more keen With eager compounds we our palate urge As , to prevent our maladies unseen , We sicken to shun sickness when we purge Ev n so , being full of your ne er cloying sweetness , To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding And , sick of welfare , found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing . Thus policy in love , t anticipate The ills that were not , grew to faults assured , And brought to medicine a healthful state Which , rank of goodness , would by ill be cured But thence I learn , and find the lesson true , Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you .
What potions have I drunk of siren tears , Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within , Applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears , Still losing when I saw myself to win What wretched errors hath my heart committed , Whilst it hath thought itself so blessèd never How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill , now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater . So I return rebuked to my content , And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent .
That you were once unkind befriends me now , And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow , Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel . For if you were by my unkindness shaken , As I by yours , you’ve passed a hell of time , And I , a tyrant , have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime . O that our night of woe might have rememb’red My deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits , And soon to you as you to me then tendered The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits But that your trespass now becomes a fee Mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me .
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed , When not to be receives reproach of being , And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed Not by our feeling but by others seeing . For why should others false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my frailties why are frailer spies , Which in their wills count bad what I think good No , I am that I am , and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own I may be straight , though they themselves be bevel . By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown , Unless this general evil they maintain All men are bad , and in their badness reign .
Thy gift , thy tables , are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory , Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date , ev n to eternity Or at the least , so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to razed oblivion yield his part Of thee , thy record never can be missed . That poor retention could not so much hold , Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold , To trust those tables that receive thee more To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me .
No Time , thou shalt not boast that I do change . Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel , nothing strange They are but dressings of a former sight . Our dates are brief , and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old , And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told . Thy registers and thee I both defy , Not wond ring at the present nor the past For thy recórds and what we see doth lie , Made more or less by thy continual haste . This I do vow and this shall ever be I will be true , despite thy scythe and thee .
If my dear love were but the child of state , It might for Fortune’s bastard be unfathered , As subject to time’s love or to time’s hate , Weeds among weeds , or flow rs with flowers gathered . No , it was builded far from accident It suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls Under the blow of thrallèd discontent , Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls . It fears not policy , that heretic , Which works on leases of short numb’red hours . But all alone stands hugely politic , That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers . To this I witness call the fools of time , Which die for goodness , who have lived for crime .
Were’t ought to me I bore the canopy , With my extern the outward honoring , Or laid great bases for eternity , Which prove more short than waste or ruining Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor Lose all and more by paying too much rent , For compound sweet forgoing simple savor , Pitiful thrivers , in their gazing spent No , let me be obsequious in thy heart , And take thou my oblation , poor but free , Which is not mixed with seconds , knows no art , But mutual render , only me for thee . Hence , thou suborned informer A true soul When most impeached stands least in thy control .
O thou , my lovely boy , who in thy pow r Dost hold time’s fickle glass , his sickle hour , Who hast by waning grown , and therein show’st Thy lovers withering , as thy sweet self grow’st If nature , sovereign mistress over wrack , As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back , She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace , and wretched minute kill . Yet fear her , O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain , but not still keep , her treasure . Her audit , though delayed , answered must be , And her quietus is to render thee .
In the old age black was not counted fair , Or if it were , it bore not beauty’s name . But now is black beauty’s successive heir , And beauty slandered with a bastard shame . For since each hand hath put on nature’s pow r , Fairing the foul with art’s false borrowed face , Sweet beauty hath no name , no holy bow r , But is profaned , if not lives in disgrace . Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black , Her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem At such who , not born fair , no beauty lack , Sland ring creation with a false esteem . Yet so they mourn , becoming of their woe , That every tongue says beauty should look so .
How oft when thou , my music , music play’st Upon that blessèd wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers , when thou gently sway’st The wiry concord that mine ear confounds , Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand , Whilst my poor lips , which should that harvest reap , At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand . To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips , O er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait , Making dead wood more blest than living lips . Since saucy jacks so happy are in this , Give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss .
Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action , and till action , lust Is perjured , murd rous , bloody , full of blame , Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust , Enjoyed no sooner but despisèd straight , Past reason hunted , and no sooner had , Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad Mad in pursuit , and in possession so , Had , having , and in quest to have , extreme A bliss in proof , and proved , a very woe Before , a joy proposed behind , a dream . All this the world well knows , yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun Coral is far more red than her lips red If snow be white , why then her breasts are dun If hairs be wires , black wires grow on her head I have seen roses damasked , red and white , But no such roses see I in her cheeks And in some pérfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks . I love to hear her speak , yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound . I grant I never saw a goddess go My mistress , when she walks , treads on the ground . And yet , by heaven , I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare .
Thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art , As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel For well thou know’st , to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel . Yet in good faith some say , that thee behold , Thy face hath not the pow r to make love groan . To say they err I dare not be so bold , Although I swear it to myself alone And to be sure that is not false , I swear A thousand groans but thinking on thy face One on another’s neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgment’s place . In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds , And thence this slander , as I think , proceeds .
Thine eyes I love , and they , as pitying me , Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain , Have put on black , and loving mourners be , Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain And truly , not the morning sun of heav n Better becomes the gray cheeks of the east , Nor that full star that ushers in the ev n Doth half that glory to the sober west , As those two mourning eyes become thy face . O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me , since mourning doth thee grace , And suit thy pity like in every part . Then will I swear beauty herself is black , And all they foul that thy complexion lack .
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me Is’t not enough to torture me alone , But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken , And my next self thou harder hast engrossed Of him , myself , and thee I am forsaken , A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed . Prison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward , But then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail . Whoe er keeps me , let my heart be his guard Thou canst not then use rigor in my jail . And yet thou wilt , for I being pent in thee , Perforce am thine , and all that is in me .
So now I have confessed that he is thine , And I myself am mortgaged to thy will , Myself I’ll forfeit , so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still . But thou wilt not , nor he will not be free , For thou art covetous , and he is kind . He learned but surety like to write for me , Under that bond that him as fast doth bind . The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take , Thou usurer , that put’st forth all to use , And sue a friend came debtor for my sake So him I lose through my unkind abuse . Him have I lost thou hast both him and me He pays the whole , and yet am I not free .
Whoever hath her wish , thou hast thy Will , And Will to boot , and Will in overplus More than enough am I , that vex thee still , To thy sweet will making addition thus . Wilt thou , whose will is large and spacious , Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine Shall will in others seem right gracious , And in my will no fair acceptance shine The sea , all water , yet receives rain still , And in abundance addeth to his store So thou , being rich in Will , add to thy Will One will of mine , to make thy large Will more . Let no unkind , no fair beseechers kill Think all but one , and me in that one Will .
If thy soul check thee that I come so near , Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will , And will , thy soul knows , is admitted there Thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfill . Will will fulfill the treasure of thy love , Ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one . In things of great receipt with ease we prove Among a number one is reckoned none . Then in the number let me pass untold , Though in thy store’s account I one must be . For nothing hold me , so it please thee hold That nothing me , a something sweet to thee . Make but my name thy love , and love that still And then thou lov’st me , for my name is Will .
Thou blind fool love , what dost thou to mine eyes , That they behold , and see not what they see They know what beauty is , see where it lies , Yet what the best is take the worst to be . If eyes corrupt by over partial looks Be anchored in the bay where all men ride , Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forgèd hooks , Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart knows the wide world’s common place Or mine eyes , seeing this , say this is not , To put fair truth upon so foul a face In things right true my heart and eyes have erred , And to this false plague are they now transferred .
When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her , though I know she lies , That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearnèd in the world’s false subtleties . Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , Although she knows my days are past the best , Simply I credit her false speaking tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed . But wherefore says she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O love’s best habit is in seeming trust , And age in love loves not t have years told . Therefore I lie with her , and she with me , And in our faults by lies we flattered be .
O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart . Wound me not with thine eye , but with thy tongue Use pow r with pow r , and slay me not by art . Tell me thou lov’st elsewhére but in my sight , Dear heart , forbear to glance thine eye aside . What need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my o er pressed defense can bide Let me excuse thee Ah , my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies , And therefore from my face she turns my foes , That they elsewhére might dart their injuries . Yet do not so , but since I am near slain , Kill me outr ght with looks , and rid my pain .
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My tongue tied patience with too much disdain , Lest sorrow lend me words , and words express The manner of my pity wanting pain . If I might teach thee wit , better it were , Though not to love , yet love , to tell me so , As testy sick men , when their deaths be near , No news but health from their physicians know . For if I should despair , I should grow mad , And in my madness might speak ill of thee . Now this ill wresting world is grown so bad , Mad sland’rers by mad ears believèd be . That I may not be so , nor thou belied , Bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide .
In faith , I do not love thee with mine eyes , For they in thee a thousand errors note But ’tis my heart that loves what they despise , Who in despite of view is pleased to dote . Nor are mine ears with thy tongue’s tune delighted , Nor tender feeling to base touches prone , Nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone . But my five wits , nor my five senses , can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee , Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man , Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be . Only my plague thus far I count my gain , That she that makes me sin awards me pain .
Love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate , Hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving . O but with mine compare thou thine own state , And thou shalt find it merits not reproving Or , if it do , not from those lips of thine , That have profaned their scarlet ornaments And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine , Robbed others beds revénues of their rents . Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those Whom thine eyes woo as mine impórtune thee . Root pity in thy heart , that when it grows , Thy pity may deserve to pitied be . If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide , By self example mayst thou be denied .
Lo , as a careful housewife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away , Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In púrsuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase , Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face , Not prizing her poor infant’s discontent So run’st thou after that which flies from thee , Whilst I , thy babe , chase thee afar behind . But if thou catch thy hope , turn back to me , And play the mother’s part , kiss me , be kind . So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will , If thou turn back and my loud crying still .
Two loves I have , of comfort and despair , Which , like two spirits , do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair , The worser spirit a woman colored ill . To win me soon to hell , my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side , And would corrupt my saint to be a devil , Wooing his purity with her foul pride . And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may , but not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend , I guess one angel in another’s hell . Yet this shall I ne er know , but live in doubt , Till my bad angel fire my good one out .
Those lips that love’s own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that languished for her sake But when she saw my woeful state , Straight in her heart did mercy come , Chiding that tongue that , ever sweet , Was used in giving gentle doom , And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she altered with an end That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night , who like a fiend From heav n to hell is flown away . I hate from hate away she threw , And saved my life , saying not you .
Poor soul , the center of my sinful earth , these rebel pow rs that thee array , Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth , Painting thy outward walls so costly gay Why so large cost , having so short a lease , Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend Shall worms , inheritors of this excess , Eat up thy charge Is this thy body’s end Then , soul , live thou upon thy servant’s loss , And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross Within be fed , without be rich no more . So shalt thou feed on death , that feeds on men , And death once dead , there’s no more dying then .
My love is as a fever , longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease , Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill , Th uncertain sickly appetite to please . My reason , the physician to my love , Angry that his prescriptions are not kept , Hath left me , and I desp rate now approve Desire is death , which physic did except . Past cure I am , now reason is past care , And frantic mad with evermore unrest , My thoughts and my discourse as madmen’s are , At random from the truth vainly expressed For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright , Who art as black as hell , as dark as night .
O me what eyes hath love put in my head , Which have no correspondence with true sight Or , if they have , where is my judgment fled , That censures falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote , What means the world to say it is not so If it be not , then love doth well denote Love’s eye is not so true as all men’s no , How can it O how can love’s eye be true , That is so vexed with watching and with tears No marvel then , though I mistake my view The sun itself sees not till heaven clears . O cunning love With tears thou keep’st me blind , Lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find .
Canst thou , O cruel , say I love thee not , When I against myself with thee partake Do I not think on thee , when I forgot Am of myself , all , tyrant , for thy sake Who hateth thee that I do call my friend On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon Nay , if thou lour’st on me , do I not spend Revenge upon myself with present moan What merit do I in myself respect , That is so proud thy service to despise , When all my best doth worship thy defect , Commanded by the motion of thine eyes But , love , hate on , for now I know thy mind Those that can see thou lov’st , and I am blind .
O from what pow r hast thou this pow rful might , With insufficiency my heart to sway , To make me give the lie to my true sight , And swear that brightness doth not grace the day Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill , That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds Who taught thee how to make me love thee more , The more I hear and see just cause of hate O , though I love what others do abhor , With others thou shouldst not abhor my state . If thy unworthiness raised love in me , More worthy I to be beloved of thee .
Love is too young to know what conscience is , Yet who knows not conscience is born of love Then , gentle cheater , urge not my amiss , Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove For , thou betraying me , I do betray My nobler part to my gross body’s treason . My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no father reason , But , rising at thy name , doth point out thee As his triumphant prize proud of this pride , He is contented thy poor drudge to be , To stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side . No want of conscience hold it that I call Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall .
In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing , In act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn , In vowing new hate after new love bearing . But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee , When I break twenty I am perjured most , For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee , And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness , Oaths of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy , And , to enlighten thee , gave eyes to blindness , Or made them swear against the thing they see . For I have sworn thee fair more perjured eye , To swear against the truth so foul a lie .
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep . A maid of Dian’s this advantage found , And his love kindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valley fountain of that ground , Which borrowed from this holy fire of love A dateless lively heat , still to endure , And grew a seething bath , which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure . But at my mistress eye love’s brand new fired , The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I , sick withal , the help of bath desired , And thither hied , a sad distempered guest , But found no cure the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eye .
The little love god lying once asleep Laid by his side his heart inflaming brand , Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep Came tripping by but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire , Which many legions of true hearts had warmed And so the general of hot desire Was , sleeping , by a virgin hand disarmed . This brand she quenchèd in a cool well by , Which from love’s fire took heat perpetual , Growing a bath and healthful remedy For men diseased but I , my mistress thrall , Came there for cure , and this by that I prove Love’s fire heats water water cools not love .
