Before we go any further , listen to me .
Speak , speak .
Are you all certain that you’d rather die fighting than starve to death
Yes , we’re certain .
As you know , Caius Martius is our chief enemy .
Yes , we know .
Let’s kill him , so we can sell our corn at the price we choose . Are we agreed
No need to talk about this anymore let’s do it . Let’s go .
No , our general’s infatuation is out of control . His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops . Now his eyes devote themselves exclusively to a certain brown skinned face . His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights , but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore .
Look at them . Take a good look , and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester . Look and see .
Continue , Solinus , and bring on my downfall . Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
Merchant of Syracuse , stop your begging I’m not inclined to bend our laws . The hatred and discord between our two cities is the result of the bitter offenses your duke has perpetrated against the merchants of Ephesus , our well behaved countrymen . Lacking the money to ransom themselves , these merchants were executed under your duke’s harsh laws , and this has erased all looks of pity from my face . Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours , both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns . No–the law goes further if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus , that man dies , and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke , unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself . Your possessions , even if we calculate their worth very generously , don’t even add up to a hundred marks . Therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
At least I have this comfort when you finish speaking , my troubles will also end , at sundown .
If what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
If only we had divine inspiration , our play might rise to the highest level of imagination . If we had a stage as big as a kingdom , real kings and queens to act the part of kings and queens , and royalty to also witness the glorious spectacle , then it would be as it really was . Then valiant King Harry would resemble the god of war , as he did in life , and famine , sword , and fire would sit like dogs at his feet , waiting to be unleashed . But , ladies and gentlemen , since that’s not the case , you must forgive us plain , ordinary men who dare to act out so great a story on this humble stage . Can this theater seem to contain the sweeping fields of France Could we even squeeze into this little theater the helmets that looked so frightening at Agincourt Hardly But , pardon us , because just as a few strokes of a pen , a few zeros , can signify a huge number , we , who are zeros in this great story , can work on your imagination . Pretend that within the confines of this theater sit two great kingdoms divided by a narrow but perilous ocean . Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections . Divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army . Imagine , when we talk of horses , that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth . Because now it is your thoughts that must dress up our kings and transport them from place to place . Your thoughts must leap over huge spans of time , turning the events of many
I remember , Adam , that’s exactly why my father only left me a thousand crowns in his will . And as you know , my father commanded my brother , Oliver , to make sure that I was brought up well and that’s where my sadness begins . Oliver keeps my brother Jaques away at school , and everyone says he’s doing extremely well there . But he keeps me at home in the country to be precise , he keeps me stuck at home but doesn’t support me . I ask you , is this any way to treat a gentleman as nobly born as I am , to pen me in like an ox His horses get treated better than I do at least he feeds them and trains them properly , and spends a lot of money on trainers for them . All I’ve gained from his care is weight , which makes me as indebted to him as his animals on the manure pile are . He gives me plenty of nothing , and takes away everything else , letting me eat with his servants , refusing me what’s owed me as his brother , and ruining my good birth with a poor education . This is what angers me , Adam . My father’s temper and spirit , which I think I share , makes me want to mutiny against my brother’s tyranny . I won’t stand for it any longer , though I haven’t yet figured out how to revolt .
Here comes my master , your brother .
Go hide , Adam , and you’ll hear how he abuses me .
Hello Who’s the doorman around here
Who shall I say you are
His lordship is out walking in the orchard . If you don’t mind , knock at the orchard gate and he’ll answer it himself .
Here comes the Earl .
What’s the news , Lord Bardolph Every minute , new violence erupts it is a wild time . Conflict is like a horse , fed with too much rich food it has broken out uncontrollably , and tramples everyone who stands before it .
Despite how shaken and pale with worry we are , let’s take advantage of this moment of peace to catch our breath , and as we pant we’ll speak about the battles we’ll soon fight in foreign lands . England will no longer be wet with her own people’s blood . War will no longer damage her fields , and warhorses will no longer trample her flowers . The soldiers on either side of this vicious civil war were countrymen and brothers , as similar to one another as shooting stars . They may have clashed recently , but now they will march together in beautiful formation , no longer struggling against family and friend . War is like a mishandled knife it can cut its owner , but it will no longer cut us . My friends , we are now soldiers for Christ , and we take his blessed cross as our battle flag . We’ll raise a new army of Englishmen and march all the way to the Holy Land . Our soldiers were born to chase non believers from that holy ground touched by Jesus feet feet which , fourteen hundred years ago , were nailed to the cross for our sins .
We’re poor . The nobles are rich . The nobles have so much to eat that they overindulge and get sick , but if they’d only give us their excess food , we wouldn’t be starving any longer . We’d think they were compassionate if they helped us , but they think we’re too expensive to feed and don’t deserve to eat . They look at our thin , starving bodies and see them as a measure of their own abundance . Our suffering shows them how much they have . Let’s seek revenge with our pitchforks before we become as thin as rakes . The gods know I only say this because I’m hungry for bread , not thirsty for revenge .
Who’s there
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
I want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
Then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
I have news from Rome , my good lord .
Which irritaties me . Give me a summary .
years into the space of a few hours . To that end , consider me a sort of chorus , here to help tell the story . And , as the speaker of any prologue should , I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly .
Would you attack Caius Martius in particular
No , who are you Stop and identify yourself .
Long live the king
Is that Barnardo
Yes , it’s me .
You’ve come right on time .
The clock’s just striking twelve . Go home to bed , Francisco .
Has it been a quiet night
Well , Syracusian , tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus .
No , listen to it , Antony . Perhaps Fulvia is angry with you . Who knows , maybe the baby faced Caesar has orders for you Do this , do that conquer that kingdom , liberate this one . Do it or we’ll condemn you .
What , my love
Maybe No , most likely . You can’t stay here any longer . Caesar has sent your dismissal , so pay attention , Antony . Where’s Fulvia’s summons excuse me , I should have said Caesar’s . Or do Fulvia and Caesar both beckon you back to Rome Call in the messengers and we’ll find out . As surely as I am the queen of Egypt , Antony , you’re blushing , which means you’re Caesar’s servant . Or that that bitch Fulvia still has the power to humiliate you . Call the messengers
Asking me to speak of my unspeakable griefs–that’s the hardest task you could impose on me . But I’ll do it so that the world can see that it was natural emotion , and not a desire to break the law , that brought me to this fate . I’ll tell you whatever my sorrow permits me to say . I was born in Syracuse , and I married a woman–a fortunate woman , except for having been married to me . And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad . I lived with her in joy , and our wealth increased from the prosperous journeys I frequently made to Epidamnum . Then my agent died and , obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad , I was drawn away from my wife’s fond embraces . I hadn’t been gone for six months when my wife , almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy , made arrangements to follow me , and she soon arrived safely where I was . She hadn’t been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys . It was strange they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names . In the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys . Their parents had very little , so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons . My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys , and every day she would press me to return home . Reluctantly , I agreed–alas Too quickly , we boarded a ship .
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak .
Well , good night . If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus , who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight , tell them to hurry .
I think I hear them . Stop Who’s there
Let Rome be washed away in the Tiber and let the great empire fall . My place is here . Kingdoms are only dirt . The soil feeds animals as well as people , so how does having a kingdom separate humans from beasts The noblest thing is to do what we’re doing , particularly when the couple is as well matched as we are . I demand that the world admit we are the perfect couple or else suffer the consequences .
Hey , you What are you making here
Nothing . I’ve never been taught how to make anything .
Well , then , what are you messing up
I’m helping you mess up one of God’s creations your poor , unworthy brother by having him do nothing .
Indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
Do you know where you are , sir
Yes , sir , very well I’m here in your orchard .
But that’s been my plan for a year now , so there’s no point in telling you all this again . That’s not the issue at hand . So tell me , my noble kinsman Westmoreland , what my royal advisors decided last night about this important undertaking .
Do you know whom you’re talking to
Yes , better than you know me . I know you’re my oldest brother , and deserve more respect . But we’re in the same family , so you should acknowledge that I am a gentleman too . According to custom , as the first born you are my superior . But it’s not customary to treat me like I’m not even a gentleman , even if there were twenty brothers between you and me . I have as much of our father in me as you do , though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older .
Your Highness , there was hot debate about this urgent mission , and many responsibilities had just been assigned when we were suddenly cut off by a messenger with bad news from Wales . The worst of it was that the noble Mortimer , who was leading the men of Herefordshire in battle against that barbarian Glendower , was captured . A thousand of his men have been butchered , their dead corpses desecrated by the Welsh women . The things they did were so horrible that I’m too ashamed to report them .
I suppose this news disrupts our plans to invade the Holy Land .
What an enormous lie Why did he marry Fulvia if he didn’t love her I’ll pretend to be a fool and believe him . He’ll never change .
Unless he is moved and inspired by Cleopatra . Now , since we love the feeling of being in love , let’s not spoil the mood with serious discussion . We shouldn’t spend a minute without some kind of amusement . What shall we do tonight
Come on , big brother you don’t know anything about fighting .
What , you dare put your hands on me , villain
I’m no villain . I’m the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys , and anyone who claims my father’s sons are villains is a villain himself . If you weren’t my brother , I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this . You’ve only insulted yourself .
My lord , this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign . Everyone thought it would pass then , and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time , which required the matter to be put off .
Let me go , I say .
But how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord
I won’t until I’m ready . You will listen to me . My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education . But you’ve raised me as a peasant , hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman . My father’s spirit is growing in me , and I won’t take this any longer . Either give me the freedom to act like someone of my own rank or give me my share of the inheritance , so that I can seek my fortune elsewhere .
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money Beg Well , sir , go inside . I’m not going to be bothered by you for long . You’ll get some of what you want . Now please leave me alone .
We have to think about that . If it does pass , the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses , because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy , pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand two hundred squires , and a hundred well supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers , old age pensioners , the poor , and those too weak or sick to work . Add to that a yearly sum of a thousand pounds to go directly into the king’s coffers . That’s what the bill says .
That would be quite a drain .
Noble Earl , I have reliable news from Shrewsbury .
Good news , God willing .
As good as one could wish for . The King has been wounded and is near death . And , thanks to your son’s luck , Prince Harry has been killed . Douglas killed both Lords Blunt . Prince John of Lancaster , Westmoreland , and Stafford fled the battlefield . And your son captured that hulking Sir John Falstaff , Prince Harry’s fattened pig . Oh , there hasn’t been a battle so well fought or a victory so well won since the days of Julius Caesar It brings honor to our times .
How do you know all this Did you see the battlefield Did you come from Shrewsbury
I talked with someone , my lord , who was coming from there . He was a gentleman , with good breeding and a good reputation . He swore that all this was the truth .
Here comes my servant , Travers . I sent him last Tuesday to find out what was happening .
Sir , I passed him on my way here . He doesn’t know anything more than what I told him .
Now Travers , what good news do you have
We should attack him first . He’s like a cruel dog to the people .
Have you considered the ways he has served our country
I’ve considered them very well , and I’d be happy to honor him for his service , except he already honors himself by being proud .
Don’t speak so harshly .
Listen , all that he’s famous for doing , he did simply to become famous . Slow witted men can be content to say he acted on behalf of his country , but the truth is that he fought to please his mother and also , in part , out of pride . He has just as much pride as courage .
You call it a vice , but being proud is his nature . And you can’t accuse him of being interested in the spoils of war .
Who’s shouting The other side of the city is taking action . Why are we standing around talking Let’s go to the capitol
Let’s go .
Wait , who’s coming
It’s worthy Menenius Agrippa , one who has always loved the people .
He’s decent enough . I wish that all the other nobles were
We had sailed a league away from Epidamnum before the sea , which always obeys the winds commands , gave any indication of danger . We didn’t stay hopeful much longer soon , the sky grew so dark that we were convinced we were going to die immediately . I could have accepted that , but I was forced by my wife’s incessant weeping–she wept in advance for the things that she saw ahead–and the piteous complaints of the sweet infants–who cried in imitation of the adults , without understanding why–to find a way to save us . Here’s the best I could do the crew of our ship had fled for safety in the lifeboats and left us to sink with the ship . My wife , who was very concerned about the younger of our twins , tied him to a spare mast–the kind that sailors use for just such a purpose . She tied one of the other twins to him . I did the same with the remaining two boys . With the children taken care of , my wife and I tied ourselves to opposite ends of the mast and floated off , obedient to the current . It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought . Eventually the sun , looking down upon the earth , burned off the threatening storm clouds . By the power of the sun’s wished for light , the seas became calm . We saw two ships sailing toward us , one from Corinth , the other from Epidaurus . But before they reached us–let me say no more You’ll have to imagine what came next , based on what had already happened .
Meet with the ambassadors .
Shame on you , stubborn Queen Everything you do is attractive scolding , laughing , crying every emotion seems admirable when you express it . I won’t see any messengers but yours . Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people . Come , my Queen . That’s what you wanted to do last night . Don’t talk to us .
Does Antony have so little respect for Caesar
Sir , sometimes he’s like a different person , a person who can’t measure up to the former Antony .
Sir , Lord Bardolph told me happy news and I turned around , to come back here . But he had a faster horse , so he passed me and got here first . Another man came after him , riding hard . He was nearly exhausted from going so fast , and he stopped to give his bleeding horse a break . He asked me for directions to Chester , and I demanded to hear news from Shrewsbury . He said that the rebels had been beaten , and that Harry Percy’s spur was cold . Then he took off on his horse , leaned forward in his saddle , and jammed his heels into the animal’s side so hard that they almost disappeared . He rode so fast he seemed to be devouring the highway . He didn’t stay around to answer any of my questions .
What Say that again he said that Harry Percy’s spur was cold Hotspur is now Coldspur That the rebels had bad luck
But why would that gentleman who rode past Travers describe such examples of loss
My loyal , hard working friend Sir Walter Blunt has arrived here at court , fresh off his horse and covered with the mud of every town from Holmedon to here . He’s brought us very welcome news . The Earl of Douglas has been defeated . Blunt saw ten thousand Scotsmen and twenty two knights piled up in their own blood on the fields of Holmedon . Hotspur took these men prisoner Douglas son Mordake , the Earl of Fife as well as the Earls of Athol , Murray , Angus , and Menteith . That’s a valuable group A fantastic catch , isn’t it , kinsman
Truly , that’s a conquest to make even a prince brag .
I won’t bother you any more than necessary .
And you get lost too , you old dog .
Is that my reward to be called old dog Well , it’s true , I’ve served this family so long I’ve gotten old and toothless , like a dog . God bless my old master . He would never have spoken to me like this .
Is that how it’s going to be Are you starting to challenge me I’ll cure you of your insolence , and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns , either Hey , Dennis
Wasn’t Charles , the duke’s wrestler , here to speak with me
Yes , sir , he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you .
Call him in .
I have a good plan . And tomorrow is the wrestling match .
I’m sad to say this confirms the stories being told about him in Rome , which I had taken to be lies . Well , I’ll hope things change for the better soon . Have a good night
Good morning , sir .
Good Mr . Charles Tell me , what’s the latest news at the new court
Yes . And the look on his face is like the title page of a book it hints at the tragic story within . His brow is lined with furrows , like a beach after a wild flood . Morton , did you come from Shrewsbury
No news but the old news the old Duke Senior has been banished by his younger brother , the new Duke Frederick . A few loyal lords have gone into exile with Duke Senior , and given up their lands and money to Frederick so he’s happy enough to have them leave .
I ran from Shrewsbury , my noble lord . Death was there , frightening our side with his ugliest mask .
Can you tell me whether Rosalind , Duke Senior’s daughter , has also been banished
It would drain us dry .
Where will the old duke live
But what can be done to prevent it
Douglas is alive , and so is your brother , for now . But as for your son , my lord
They say he’s already in the Forest of Arden . He has many cheerful men with him , and they live like Robin Hood and his outlaws . People say that new batches of young men flock there every day , and that they all pass the time without a care , like people did in the Golden Age .
The king is virtuous and kind .
Why , he is dead . My suspicion is so quick to speak When a man fears something , and doesn’t want to know the truth , he can still tell when that thing has happened by instinct , he can read it in another man’s eyes . But speak , Morton . Tell me , who am an earl , that I have
And a true lover of the holy Church .
Friends of this country .
And servants of the Danish king .
Good night to you both .
Good bye . Who’s taken over the watch for you
Hello , Barnardo .
Hello . Is Horatio here too
Welcome , Horatio . Welcome , Marcellus .
So , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight
I haven’t seen anything .
Horatio says we’re imagining it , and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now . That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it .
Indeed I do , sir , and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem . I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise . Tomorrow , sir , I’m fighting for my reputation , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed . Your brother is young and inexperienced , and because of my affection for you , I’d hate to crush him though I’d have to , if he challenged me . I’m telling you all this out of affection for you , so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace , which will be his own fault , not mine .
Charles , I thank you for your loyalty to me , and you’ll see that I’ll reward you . I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind , but he’s determined . I tell you , Charles , he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France overly ambitious , jealous of other people’s good qualities , and a traitor against me , his own blood brother . So use your discretion . I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger . And you’d better be careful , because if you embarrass him at all in fact , if he doesn’t beat you thoroughly he’ll come after you and won’t leave you alone till he’s poisoned you or trapped you killed you , in other words , one way or another . It brings me to tears to say this , but there isn’t another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked . Because he’s my brother , I have to take his side . But if I really laid him bare , I’d have to weep and hang my head , and you would not believe me , his behavior is so shocking .
no talent for prophecy . I’ll take it as a pleasant insult , and I’ll pay you richly for doing me that wrong .
You are too great a man to be slandered by me . Your instinct is correct your fears are true .
But despite all this , don’t say that Percy’s dead . I can see a strange sort of confession in your eyes . You shake your head you’re afraid to tell the truth , or you think it would be sinful . If he’s been killed , say so . The man who reports a death doesn’t offend with that report . To lie about the dead is a sin , but it is no sin to say that a dead man is not alive . It’s a losing situation , being the first man to bring unwelcome news . That man’s voice sounds forever like a sad bell , and it will always be remembered for tolling the death of a friend .
My lord , I cannot believe your son is dead .
I’m sorry that I must force you to believe this , when I wish to God that I hadn’t seen it myself . But I saw him , in his bloody state , with my own eyes . He was barely able to fight back , exhausted and out of breath . Harry Monmouth’s swift fury beat the unflinching Percy down to the ground , and once he was there , Percy never rose again . To be brief , Percy’s spirit inspired the entire army , down to the dullest peasant . When the news got out that he had been killed , it took the fire and courage away from even the bravest soldiers . Percy’s metal steeled the whole army when they learned that he had been blunted , they bent and warped like dull , heavy lead . And just as a heavy object gains momentum once it’s pushed into motion , our army , made heavy by
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost the most consummate Alexas , where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen Oh , I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife
What can I do for you
Are you the man who knows the future
I can understand a few of nature’s infinite secrets .
Give him your hand to read .
Bring the dessert in right away , and make sure there’s enough wine to toast Cleopatra’s health .
I don’t make fortunes I only see them .
Then see a good one for me .
Your beauty will be even greater than it is now .
He means I’ll get fat .
No , he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old .
His uncle Worcester put him up to that . It is just like Worcester to act against you in all ways . He’s the one making Hotspur behave like this , flaunting his youth in the face of your dignified age .
May my wrinkles forbid that
Don’t joke about his predictions . Pay attention .
Quiet
You will love more than you are loved .
I’m very glad I came to see you . If he shows up tomorrow , I’ll give him what’s coming to him . If he can manage to walk after our fight , I’ll never wrestle for money again . Farewell , my lord .
Take care , Charles .
Now it’s time to get this playboy brother of mine all worked up . I hope I’ll see the end of him soon I don’t know why , but I hate nothing in the world as much as him , though he’s an upstanding guy . He’s never gone to school but he’s smart , with good values , and everyone is delighted by him and loves him , especially my subjects , who know him the best . They love him , and therefore they despise me . But not for long Charles will take care of everything . All I have to do is get Orlando to fight , which I’ll do now .
No , keep going , old man don’t stop like that . For we may take pity on you , even if we can’t pardon you .
Had the gods taken pity on us , I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless . The two ships hadn’t come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle . As we were unjustly separated from each other , both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over . For her part–the poor soul Her half of the mast weighed less , but she was no luckier than I was the wind carried her away more quickly . I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinth–or so I thought . After a while , another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me . The sailors knew me , so they took good care of us . Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children , but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home . So now you’ve heard how I was separated from everything I love . It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .
And for the sake of those you grieve for , do me a favor tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them , up to this point .
What are you working on , my countrymen Where are you going with bats and clubs What’s the matter Please tell me .
The Senate knows what we’re upset about . They’ve known for two weeks what we intend to do , and now we’re going to show them . They say poor workers have bad breath . They’re about to find out that we have strong arms too .
Masters , my good friends , my honest neighbors , why will you harm yourselves
We’re already hurt .
I tell you , friends , the nobles take very good care of you . For the relief you want from your suffering , you’d do just as well to rise up against the heavens as against the Roman state . The Senate isn’t going to change its course . However strong a chain you form , the Senate will break you because it’s ten thousand times stronger . The gods , not the nobles , are responsible for whatever you lack , therefore you should fall to your knees and pray , not raise your arms and fight . You’re getting carried away by your calamity , and you’re only inviting more trouble . You’re slandering the senators , cursing them as your enemies , without realizing that they care for you like fathers care for their children .
Hotspur’s death , suddenly started moving fast faster than arrows flying toward a target but they flew toward safety , not toward the battle . Soon , Worcester , that furious Scotsman , was captured . The warlike Douglas , who killed three enemies disguised as King Henry , began to lose courage he ran away as well , lending his authority to the shameful retreat . But running in fear , he stumbled and was captured . The bottom line is that King Henry has won . He’s sent a speedy force after you , sir , led by young John of Lancaster and Westmoreland . That is the whole story .
There will be time to mourn for this . Sometimes poison can be a kind of medicine this news , which would have made me sick had I been well , has , because I am sick , made me well . A dying man his joints weakened by fever , dangling like useless hinges and crumpling under the man’s own weight will sometimes be stuck with a fit of impatience , causing him to burst out of his caretaker’s arms . My limbs are like that now once weakened by grief , they’re now enraged by grief , and are three times as powerful as they were before . Away from me , you unmanly crutch Chain mail armor will cover my hands now . Away from me , you invalid’s cap You are too fanciful a helmet for this head which is now the target of kings , grown arrogant with their victories . Wrap my head in iron , and then attack me with the roughest things that destiny and hatred will dare to bring upon me in my rage . Let the sky come crashing down Let the ocean overflow the shores Let law and order die And let the world no longer be a stage for a long , drawn out struggle let the spirit of
Dear Celia I already look much happier than I feel , but you want me to look even happier Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father , you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy .
Well , I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
You know I’m my father’s only child , and he isn’t likely to have another . And when he dies , you will inherit his fortune because whatever he took from your father by force , I will return to you as affection . I swear I will , and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster . So please , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be happy .
From now on I will , cousin , and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us . Let me see what do you think about falling in love
Yes , please do , so we can have a good laugh about it . But don’t fall in love for real , and don’t take the game too far . You want to get out of it easily , and with your honor intact .
You wouldn’t have expected it based on how he acted as a youth . But no sooner had his father stopped breathing than the prince’s wildness died too . Really , at that precise moment he gained a capacity for reflection , which appeared like an angel to chase away the sinful part of him , leaving his body like a paradise , fit to house only lofty thoughts and feelings . You never saw anyone become serious and studious so quickly . You never saw such a total transformation , as though a wild river , rushing through , had swept away his faults . Such a collection of stubborn character flaws was never banished from one place so suddenly as in the case of this king .
We are fortunate in the change .
If you just listen to him discuss theological matters , you’ll find yourself thinking privately what an excellent bishop he would make . Hear him debate matters of domestic policy , and you’d swear he had made them his constant study . Listen to him talk about war , and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles . Bring up any political topic , and he’ll untangle it as easily as if it were his own garter . And the result is that when he speaks , the very air which is free to go where it likes stops dead , and men stand in silent wonder , hoping to catch the benefit of his gorgeous utterances . There must be skill and experience behind all this abstract thought , but it’s anyone’s guess how he obtained it , since in his youth he preferred shallow pursuits , with uneducated , crude and superficial companions . He spent his time drunken , overfed , and constantly seeking out entertainment , with no inclination for learning or quiet contemplation , nor any limit to his tolerance for public haunts and crowds .
I’ve sent for Hotspur to explain himself . We’ll have to postpone the plans for our crusade to Jerusalem . Go tell my advisers that our next meeting will be Wednesday at Windsor . Then hurry back here . There’s more to be said and done , but I’m too angry now to speak .
I will , my lord .
Sit down for a while , and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe , about what we’ve seen two nights now .
Well , let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us .
Last night , when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now , at one o clock , Marcellus and I
Quiet , shut up It’s come again .
Looking just like the dead king .
You’re well educated , Horatio . Say something to it .
Doesn’t he look like the king , Horatio
It wants us to speak to it .
Ask it something , Horatio .
What are you , that you walk out so late at night , looking like the dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle By God , I order you to speak .
Well , then , what should we do for fun instead
Let’s go find that hussy , Fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
I wish we could do that , because Fortune gives all of her gifts to the wrong people , and she especially gets things wrong where women are concerned .
It’s true the women she makes beautiful she also makes slutty , and the women she makes pure and virginal she also makes ugly .
This extreme passion is bad for you , sir .
No , you’re getting Fortune and Nature mixed up Nature determines how we’re made , and Fortune decides what happens to us .
Oh , really Well , when Nature makes a person beautiful , can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire , thereby making her ugly after all And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument , hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us
Yes , and now Fortune is playing a nasty trick on Nature she’s breaking up a show of wit between two naturally witty women with the arrival of a natural fool .
We all knew that we were venturing into dangerous waters . We knew the odds were ten to one that we would come out alive , and yet we ventured forward anyway . The potential reward of winning outweighed the fear of our probable loss .
I would rather get passion from drink than from love .
Just listen to him .
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune . Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them . Tell me I’ll have a child when I’m fifty who will be honored even by Herod of Judea . Let me marry Octavius Caesar and become my Queen’s equal .
You will outlive the Queen .
Oh , excellent I love long life better than figs .
You have already had better fortune than the future will bring .
Then my children will probably be illegitimate . Tell me , please how many boys and girls will I have
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
Get out of here , you fool Since you’re a fortuneteller I won’t bring charges of witchcraft against you .
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
Never mind . Tell Iras’s fortune .
We’ll all want our fortune told .
My fortune like that of many of us tonight is to go drunk to bed .
There’s a palm that will predict a chaste life , if nothing else .
name for himself–and go in search of him . I wanted to see my lost son as well , so I risked losing the one I loved in order to find the other . I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia . On my way home , I came to Ephesus . I have no hope of finding my boys here , but I will check every place that is inhabited by men . But that is where the story of my life must end . I’d be happy to die if , in all my travels , I could prove that they are alive .
Did they make you the messenger
Poor Egeon Fate has decreed that you must endure the extremes of terrible misfortune . Believe me , if it weren’t against the law , my crown , my duty , and my position , my very soul would argue your case . But you are sentenced to death , and changing a sentence that’s already been passed would dishonor my title . However , I’ll do what I can for you . I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus . Call any friends you have . Beg or borrow to come up with the ransom . If you can , you live . If not , you are doomed to die . Jailer , take him into custody .
No , by my honor , but they told me to come get you .
I will .
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good , and that the mustard on top of them he swore on his honor was bad . Now , I’ll swear to the opposite that the pancakes were rotten , and the mustard was fine but even so , the knight wasn’t lying .
And how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that
Yes , please unleash your wisdom .
Watch me stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
We lost this time , but let’s try again . Come , we’ll all go for it , body and soul .
Care for us As if They’ve never cared for us . They force us to starve while their storehouses are full of grain . They make laws about loaning money that protect the loan sharks . Every day they repeal the laws that interfere with the interests of the wealthy and instead make strict laws to chain up and restrain the poor . If the wars we fight in don’t kill us , these laws will . That’s how well they care for us .
It is the appropriate time . Good sir , I hear for certain , and I tell you truthfully , that the Archbishop of York has raised a powerful army . He motivates his men with both his earthly and his spiritual powers . My lord , your son commanded only his soldiers bodies . The word rebellion frightened them , separating their bodies from their hearts . It caused them to fight timidly , hesitantly , as though they were taking medicine their weapons seemed to be on our side , but their spirits and souls were frozen , like fish in an icy pond . But now , the Archbishop turns our rebellion into a religious cause . Everyone believes he’s a righteous and holy man , and they follow him not only in body but also in mind . He enhances his cause by preaching about the blood of good King Richard , which was spilled at Pomfret Castle . The Archbishop claims that he derives his authority from heaven tells the men that the whole country is bleeding , gasping for life under the terrible leadership of Bolingbroke . And so men from every walk of life flock like sheep to follow him .
You must either admit that you’re being extremely malicious or you’ll be accused of foolishness . I’ll tell you a relevant story . You may have heard it , but since it illustrates my point , I’ll venture to tell it again .
I knew all this , but to tell you the truth , this terrible grief had pushed it out of my thoughts . Come inside I want to hear everyone’s ideas on the best way to defend ourselves and enact our revenge . Send out messengers and letters , and make new allies quickly . Our numbers have never been smaller , but there’s never been more need for what we have to do .
Well , I’ll listen sir , but don’t think you can trick us out of our suffering with a story . But if it pleases you , tell it .
There was a time when all the body’s parts rebelled against the belly . They accused the belly of being an idle , inactive pool in the middle the body , always hoarding the food , never working as much as the rest of the parts . The other body parts did see and hear , think , instruct , walk , feel , and together worked for the needs and desires of the whole body . The belly answered
Tell me , who is this knight
A man old Frederick , your father , loves .
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do .
Honestly , you’re speaking the truth ever since the fools were silenced , the foolishness of wise men has become all the more apparent . Here comes Monsieur Le Beau .
With his mouth full of news .
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
Then we’ll be stuffed with news .
Well that’s good . If we’re fattened up , we’ll be worth more . Hello , Monsieur Le Beau . What’s the news
Fair princess , you’ve missed some good sport .
Sport Of what color
Hal , what time is it , my boy
Now you’re talking , Hal . Thieves like us operate at night , by the moon and stars , and not by the sun . I hope , pretty boy , that when you become king , God save your Grace or maybe I should just call you Your Majesty , since you don’t have any grace
None
No , I swear . Not even enough to say grace before a snack .
Come on , out with it . Get to the point .
Okay then , pretty boy . Whey you become king , don’t let those of us who work at night be blamed for wasting daylight by sleeping through it . Give us fancy names Servants of the Moon Goddess Diana Gentlemen of Shadows Lunar Laborers . Make people admire us for being well behaved . After all , we’re governed by the same force that governs the tides the pale and cool moon , who lights our way as we sneak around .
Sirrah , you giant , what did the doctor say about my urine
He said that the urine itself was good , healthy urine , but that the man who owned it probably had more diseases than he could tell .
All kinds of people make it a matter of pride to heckle me . No man that foolishly assembled lump of clay could ever invent something quite as funny as I seem to be to other people . I’m not only witty on my own , but I bring out wit in other people . Look at the two of us , walking here I look like a sow that’s smothered all of her baby pigs , except for you . If the Prince sent you to serve me for any other reason than to irritate me , I’m a fool . You weedy little son of a bitch you’re so tiny that you should be a decoration on my hat , not a servant at my feet . I’ve never had a servant before who was as tiny as a ring stone . But I won’t set you in a gold or silver ring I’ll wrap you in rags and send you back to your master , to be used as a jewel that youth , the Prince your master , whose chin is still lacking a beard . Why , I’ll grow a beard in the palm of my hand before he’ll have one that he can shave off his face . And yet , this doesn’t stop him from claiming that he has a face for royalty . Well , God will give him a beard whenever he chooses to there’s not a hair out of place yet . It’s a good thing the Prince’s face is a royal , because a barber will never earn a coin from shaving it . And still , the
Well , sir , what did the belly answer
Sir , I’ll tell you . With a disdainful smile look , I can make the belly smile as well as speak the belly tauntingly replied to the aggravated , mutinous parts that envied the food it received much like you who rightly accuse our senators for not starving as you do .
The greedy belly , the sink of the body , should be restrained
And then what
If the parts complained , what could the belly answer
I’ll tell you . If you’ll exercise a little bit of what little patience you have , you’ll hear the belly’s answer .
Oh stop it , you lusty bed hopper . You can’t see the future .
Well , if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity , then I can’t scratch my own ear . Please , tell her an ordinary fortune .
Your fortunes are the same .
I’ve said what I have to say .
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers By an inch , even
Well , if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me , where would you like the improvement
What color , madam I don’t understand how should I answer that
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts Alexas Come and tell his fortune . Let him marry a woman he can’t satisfy , dear Isis , I pray And then let her die , and give him someone worse . Then let her die , and let her replacement be even worse . And so on until the last one , who is unfaithful with at least fifty other men and laughs at him until he dies . I beg you to grant my prayer , good Isis , even though it means you deny me something more important for myself . Good Isis , I beg you
However your wit and luck allow .
Amen , dear goddess . Listen to our prayer . If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife , it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful . Therefore , dear Isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
Or however the Destinies say you should .
Nicely done you laid that on thick .
Well , if I don’t keep up my rank
you’ll lose your smell .
You’re confusing me , ladies . I was going to tell you all about a good wrestling match that’s going on , which you’re missing .
Tell us about this wrestling .
I’ll tell you about the beginning , and if you find that interesting you can see the end . The best is yet to come , and they’re going to perform it right here .
Well , we’ve missed the beginning it’s dead and buried .
There comes an old man with his three sons
It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
Three proper young men , all good looking and with great presence
Strawberries grow underneath nettle plants , and berries grow best when they’re planted next to inferior fruit . In the same way , the prince hid his serious side under the guise of wild behavior . Just like summer grass , which grows fastest during the night , this sober quality was able to grow and thrive all the better for being undetected .
You’re taking a long time to tell it .
That must be it , because the age of miracles is passed , and we have to find reasonable explanations for why these things happen .
Pay attention , good friend . The belly was serious and deliberate , not rash like his accusers , and so he answered , It’s true , my fellow parts , he said , That I am first to receive the food supply that you live on . This is as it should be , because I am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body . But if you’ll remember , I send it through the rivers of your blood , even to the court of the heart , to the throne of the brain , and through the ducts and chambers of the body , the strongest nerves and small inferior veins receive from me all that they need to survive . And despite all that , you , my good friends , says the belly
Yes , sir , go on .
So , tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated . Just today , a merchant from Syracuse was arrested for coming here . He couldn’t afford the ransom , so by law , he’ll be put to death before the sun sets . Here’s the money you asked me to hold .
He seems neutral , perhaps leaning a little more toward our side than that of our opponents since I’ve made his Majesty an offer , following a meeting with our fellow bishops . The offer regards certain matters having to do with France that his Grace and I have been discussing . My offer would involve us giving him a greater sum than the clergy ever gave at one time to any of his predecessors .
Dromio , bring this money to the Centaur Inn , where we’re lodging , and wait there until I come . It’ll be lunchtime within an hour . Until then , I’ll walk around town , peruse the markets , and gaze upon the buildings , and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn . I’m stiff and weary from all this travel . Get going now .
It’s an answer . How does it apply to us
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
Prince brags that he’s been a full grown man since before he was born . He can keep that title , for all I care I have no affection for him now , I can assure him . What did Master Dommelton say about the satin for my cape and baggy trousers
He’s a trustworthy servant . Often , when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy , he lightens my mood with his merry pranks . Listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn
He said that you have to give him a better guarantee of payment than just saying Bardolph was good for it . He wouldn’t accept Bardolph’s promise or yours he felt that neither should be trusted .
Begging your pardon , but I’ve been invited to see some merchants , who I’m hoping to see a profit from . But if
Damn him to hell then , just like Dives in the Bible the rich glutton who rejected the beggar Lazarus And may Dommelton burn even hotter He’s a son of a bitch traitor A two faced liar , who smiles and says Yes sir , that’ll be fine to my face , and then demands a guarantee of payment These bastard shopkeepers , with their fashionable short haircuts , and fancy shoes , and their fat key chains on their belts you make an agreement to put something on credit , and then they throw a guarantee of payment at you . I would rather eat rat poison than guarantee my payment . I expected him to send me twenty two yards of satin , and instead he sends me a guarantee of payment . Well , let him guarantee himself a good night’s sleep . After all , his wife’s in somebody else’s bed , so why not She’s practically shining a spotlight on her adultery , but he’s so clueless he can’t even tell . Where’s Bardolph
He went to Smithfield to buy you a horse , sir .
I bought Bardolph at St . Paul’s Cathedral , and he’s buying me a horse in Smithfield . Now if he could just find me a wife in a whorehouse , I’d be fully stocked with high quality servants , horses , and wives .
Right , and they wore proclamations around their necks , saying , Be it known to all men by these presents
The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles , the duke’s wrestler . Immediately , Charles threw the brother , breaking three of his ribs it’s not likely he will survive . Charles did the same to the second brother , and the third . They’re lying over there , and the poor old man , their father , weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving .
Oh , dear
But tell me , monsieur what sport are the ladies missing
Why , the one I just told you about .
Men must be getting wiser every day that’s the first time I’ve heard that rib breaking was appropriate entertainment for ladies .
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs Does anyone else love rib breaking Shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin
It looks like you’ve offended it .
Look , it’s going away .
Stay Speak Speak I order you , speak
It’s gone . It won’t answer now .
What’s going on , Horatio You’re pale and trembling . You agree now that we’re not imagining this , don’t you What do you think about it
Doesn’t it look like the king
Yes , as much as you look like yourself . The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway . And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles , traveling on the ice in sleds . It’s weird .
It’s happened like this twice before , always at this exact time . He stalks by us at our post like a warrior .
I don’t know exactly how to explain this , but I have a general feeling this means bad news for our country .
Well said . And you’re right our luck ebbs and flows like the tide , because , like the sea , we’re governed by the moon . I’ll prove it . Imagine a bag of gold , brilliantly swiped on a Monday night and extravagantly spent on a Tuesday morning . You snatch it , shouting , Hand it off and spend it , calling , Bring it on It’s like the gallows one minute you’re at the bottom of the ladder low tide . The next , you’re swinging from the top high tide
By God that’s right , my boy And by the way , isn’t the hostess of the tavern a delicious woman
Sweet as honey from Hybla , you dirty old man . And isn’t a sheriff’s uniform a pretty durable outfit
What’s that supposed to mean , you crazy man You’re in the mood for jokes Why are you talking to me about a sheriff’s uniform
Well , why the hell are you asking me about the hostess of the tavern
I am the great toe Why the great toe
For the fact that you’re the leader of these ignorant rebels who are the lowest , basest , poorest of men . You’re like a stray dog that runs after whatever it can catch first . But prepare your sturdy bats and clubs Rome and you , her rats , are at the point of battle . One side is going to lose .
Hail , noble Martius
Thanks . What’s the matter , you dissenting rebels Are you make yourselves miserable by rubbing the minor itch of your opinion
You always speak kindly to us .
Whoever speaks kindly to you flatters you undeservingly . What do you want , you dogs , who are satisfied by neither peace nor war The one frightens you , and the other makes you self righteous . Whoever trusts you sees you as lions , though he should see you as hares , and sees you as foxes , though he should see you as geese . You’re as unstable as a burning coal on ice or a hailstone in the sun . Your nature is to honor those who should be punished for their crimes and then to curse the justice that punishes him . He who deserves greatness deserves your scorn . Your instincts are perverted you most desire the things that will make you sicker . He who depends on your approval swims with fins of lead and cuts down oaks with blades of grass . You should be hanged Trust you You change your mind every minute . You call the man you hated a moment ago noble , and you call the one you used to praise vile . Why do you cry against the noble Senate all around the city Second only to the gods , they take care of you , you who would otherwise eat each other . What do the people want
You’re going to have to , if you stay here . This is the place they’re scheduled to wrestle , and they’re ready to go .
Yes , I see them coming . Let’s stay and watch .
Hide I don’t want to talk to him .
Who is that man
Come on . Since the youth won’t be reasoned with , he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
Falstaff , if it please you , sir .
Is that the man
The man who was a suspect in that robbery
That’s him , madam .
See If they could make me a cuckold , they’d whore themselves in order to see it done .
That’s the one . But he did good work in the Battle of Shrewsbury , and I hear he’s taking some soldiers to help Lord John of Lancaster .
Alas , he is too young . Yet he seems capable .
Where , to York Tell him to come here .
What’s up , daughter and niece Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling
It’s not him it’s the Queen .
Sir John Falstaff
Yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
You won’t enjoy it much , I can tell you , the odds are so against this young man . Because he’s so young , I’ve tried to discourage him , but he won’t listen . Talk to him , ladies . See if you can persuade him .
You have to speak up my master is deaf .
Call him over here , good Monsieur Le Beau .
I’m sure he is , when anything good’s being said . Go , tap him on the shoulder . I must speak with him .
Wasn’t he here
Go ahead . I’ll make myself scarce .
Sir John
No , madam .
What A young troublemaker A beggar Isn’t there a war on Isn’t there work to do Doesn’t the King need subjects Don’t the rebels need soldiers Though it’s shameful to be on any side but the King’s , it’s even more shameful to be an idle beggar than a soldier on
He was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome . Enobarbus
Madam
Here , at your service . Here comes my lord .
I won’t see him . Everyone come with me .
Your wife , Fulvia , mustered her army first .
Against my brother Lucius
Yes . But that war ended as soon as circumstances made it advisable for them to join together against Caesar . But in their very first battle , Caesar won and drove them out of Italy .
it pleases you , I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime . Right now , my pressing business calls me away .
Hang them if that’s what they say They’ll sit by the fire and presume to know what goes on in the capitol who’s likely to rise , who thrives , and who declines . They’ll take sides with factions and make hasty alliances , making some groups strong and squashing those that they don’t like beneath their cheap shoes . They say there’s enough grain If the nobility would stop taking pity on the poor and let me use my sword , I’d slaughter these thousands of slaves into a pile of pieces as high as I could throw my lance .
No , they’ve almost all calmed down . Even though they make a scene , they’re actually very cowardly . But tell me , what happened with the other group of rebels
Mister Challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
They’ve disbanded . Hang them They said they were hungry , they quoted proverbs That hunger broke stone walls , that dogs must eat , that meat was made for mouths , that the gods didn’t send corn only for the rich . With these small statements they vented their complaints , and when the nobles answered by granting them a petition which is unusual because it breaks the solidarity of the nobles and makes them look weak they threw their caps into the air with joy , shouting their delight .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the Wrestler
No , lovely princess . He is the general challenger . I have only come in like the others have to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
Young gentleman , you are too bold for your age . You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength . If you took a good look at yourself , or if you thought about this more carefully , your fear would teach you to act more cautiously . We beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
Please , young sir . We’ll make sure your reputation isn’t hurt we’ll take it upon ourselves to argue with the duke that the wrestling match should be called off .
What kept you from telling him this
I beg you not to think poorly of me though I suppose anyone who could deny anything to such beautiful women deserves to be scorned . But please , send me good thoughts in this match . If I’m beaten , the shame is all mine , and I wasn’t in anyone’s good graces to begin with . If I’m killed , it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead . I won’t wrong any of my friends , because I don’t have any to mourn for me , and I won’t have wronged the world , because I don’t have anything in the world . In this world , I’m only taking up space . If I leave , maybe someone more worthy will fill it .
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king . And , in fact , I think they’re meeting together right now . Is it four o clock
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have .
Mine too , to join hers .
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word .
I’ll accompany you . I’m also eager to hear it .
wrong side even if the rebellion were more despicable than the word rebellion already leads me to believe .
You’re mistaken , sir .
Why is that Did I say you were an honest man Because , setting aside the fact that I’m knight and a soldier , I’d be nothing but a liar if I said that .
Then please , sir , set aside your knighthood and your soldiership and let me tell you that you’re a deliberate liar , if you say I’m anything other than an honest man .
Should I allow you to say that Should I set aside something that’s mine by right If I allow you anything , hang me . If you allow yourself , hang you . You’re running in the wrong direction get out of here Go
Sir , my master wants to speak with you .
My good sir God grant you a good day It’s great to see you out and about I’d heard you were sick . I hope your doctor knows you’re out . Though you’re not entirely past your youth , your lordship , you have a touch of age in you , a touch of the passage of time , and I must humbly urge you to take good care of your health .
If you don’t mind my saying so , I hear the King is back from Wales and it didn’t go so well .
You’ve asked her for the bill enough times .
Did I ever ask you to pay for any of it
No . I’ve got to admit , you’ve settled with her all by yourself .
Farewell till then . I will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
Sir , I leave you to your own contentment .
He leaves me to my own contentment , but that’s the one thing I cannot find . Out in the world , I’m like a drop of water , trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean . When that drop fails its task–unnoticed , inquisitive–it dissipates into the ocean and destroys itself . In order to find a mother and a brother , I too have lost myself , unhappily .
Here comes the man who shares my birthday . What is it How is it that you’ve come back so soon
Back so soon Too late is more like it . The chicken is burning , the pig is overcooked , the clock has already struck twelve , and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek . She’s hot because lunch is cold lunch is cold because you’re not home you’re not home because you’re not hungry you’re not hungry because you’ve eaten already . But we servants who know how to properly fast and pray are being punished for your offenses today .
All right , let’s sit down and discuss that question . Somebody tell me why this strict schedule of guards has been imposed , and why so many bronze cannons are being manufactured in Denmark , and so many weapons bought from abroad , and why the shipbuilders are so busy they don’t even rest on Sunday . Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day Who can explain this to me
I can . Or at least I can describe the rumors . As you know , our late king , whom we just now saw as a ghost , was the great rival of Fortinbras , king of Norway . Fortinbras dared him to battle . In that fight , our courageous Hamlet killed old King Fortinbras , who on the basis of a valid legal document surrendered all his territories , along with his life , to his conqueror . If our king had lost , he would have had to do the same . But now old Fortinbras’s young son , also called Fortinbras he is bold , but unproven has gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country . For some food , they’re eager to take on the tough enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost .
What was granted to them
Good luck . I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances .
Five representatives of their own choosing to defend their ignorant views . Junius Brutus , Sicinius Velutus , and I don’t know who else . God’s death The rebels would have to tear the roofs off the city before they could ever prevail upon me to grant them that . They’ll soon become more powerful and make more arguments for insurrection .
I hope you get what you desire
This is strange .
Come on , where’s the young show off who’s so eager to lie with mother earth
Go home , you crumbs
Where’s Caius Martius
You get only one round .
I’m here . What’s going on
Sir , the news is that the Volsces are prepared to fight .
You should mock me after you’ve beaten me , not before . Come on .
I’m glad about this . This means we’ll have a way to get rid of our excess population . Look , here come our best elders .
Hercules give you speed , young man
I wish I were invisible , so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg .
Martius , it’s true what you’ve been telling us lately the Volsces are ready to fight .
Oh , what an excellent young man
And not just with her , but wherever my cash was good . And when I ran out , I switched to credit .
No . You will .
I will Excellent By God , I’ll be a great judge .
You’ve judged wrong already . I mean , you’ll be in charge of hanging thieves , and become a superb hangman .
All right , Hal . I’ll tell you this in a way , being a hangman agrees with me just as well as hanging around the court .
Waiting to get your suits granted
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward . Go on . As far as I’m concerned , what’s past is done . It’s like this as long as a person tells me the truth , even though it means my death , I will listen as though he praised me .
While Antony . . . is what you want to say .
Oh , my lord
Speak plainly . Don’t tone down what the people are saying . Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her . Use Fulvia’s abusive language . Freely scold me for my faults with as much severity as an enemy with truth on his side . It’s easy to err when left to our own devices , but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them .
Good bye for a while .
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes , I can tell you who’d be on the ground .
I’m not talking about the King . You didn’t come when I sent for you .
And I also hear that the King has fallen into a terrible paralysis .
No more , no more .
Well , God give him a speedy recovery . Please , let me speak with you .
Oh , come on , your Grace I’m barely out of breath .
His paralysis is , as I understand it , a kind of lethargy , if it please you . It’s a sleepiness in the blood , a nasty tingling .
How are you doing , Charles
Why are you telling me this Let it be .
He can’t speak , my lord .
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury
It comes from heavy sadness from too much reading , and too much thinking . I read about it in the reference books it’s a kind of deafness .
Carry him away . What is your name , young man
He’s not here .
Orlando , my lord , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
Send for him , dear uncle .
Very likely , my lord , very likely . But actually , sir , I have the not listening disease I have the not paying attention sickness .
Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege
The cure for that illness would be to put you in shackles , and I wouldn’t mind being your doctor .
I wish you were someone else’s son . The whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy . Your victory would have pleased me more if you’d been someone else’s son . But good luck you are a brave young man . I wish you had told me you had a different father .
I may be as poor as Job , but I’m not as patient . You may be able to throw me in jail because of my poverty , but some people might have slight reservations about that .
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son his youngest son and I would never change that , not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir .
Thank you , I’m sure . My learned lord , kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim . And God forbid , my dear and faithful lord , that you should invent , twist , or distort your interpretation , or burden your conscience by subtly arguing for false claims . For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do . So think carefully before you incite me
I’ll be at your service .
What’s the news from Sicyon . Tell me .
The man from Sicyon
Is he here
He’s waiting outside .
Have him come in .
I must break Cleopatra’s powerful hold over me or else I’ll lose myself in foolish infatuation .
What’s your message
Your wife , Fulvia , is dead .
Where did she die
In Sicyon . In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other , more serious matters that concern you .
Leave me .
Are you there , Enobarbus
As far as I understand , that’s why we’re posted here tonight and why there’s such a commotion in Denmark lately .
I think that’s exactly right that explains why the ghost of the late king would haunt us now , since he caused these wars .
The ghost is definitely something to worry about . In the high and mighty Roman Empire , just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated , corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish . There were shooting stars , and blood mixed in with the morning dew , and threatening signs on the face of the sun . The moon , which controls the tides of the sea , was so eclipsed it almost went completely out . And we’ve had similar omens of terrible things to come , as if heaven and earth have joined together to warn us what’s going to happen .
Wait , look It has come again . I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do . Stay here , you hallucination
If you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
Oh , the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress The saddle maker has it , sir I didn’t keep it .
I’m not in a joking mood . Tell me right now and stop fooling where’s the money We’re strangers here . How dare you let such a large amount escape your keeping
Please , sir crack jokes over lunch . My mistress made me hurry here . If I go back without you , she’ll punish your faults by breaking my head open . I should think that your appetite would act like a clock and bring you home on its own , without the need for a messenger .
That’s enough , Dromio , please . This isn’t a good moment for jokes save them till a happier time . Where’s the gold I gave you
Come on , you rogue . Quit joking . Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you .
The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house , the Phoenix , for lunch . My mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money , or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood . Where are the thousand marks you had from me
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul , and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion . If I had known this young man was his son , I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .
Gentle cousin , let’s go thank him and encourage him . My my father’s rude and envious behavior is like a knife through my heart . Sir , you fought very well . If you live up to your potential in love as well , your wife will be a very happy woman .
Gentleman , wear this for me . I’m a woman who’s down on her luck , and I’d give more if I could . Shall we go , cousin
Yes . Good luck , fair gentleman .
Can’t I even say thank you I left my brain back on the wrestling field . What’s left of me is a dummy , just a lifeless block .
He’s calling us back . My pride fell when my fortunes did I’ll ask him what he wants . Did you call us , sir Sir , you wrestled well and conquered more than just your enemies .
Will you come on , cousin
to wage war . I charge you , in the name of God , be careful what you say . For mighty kingdoms such as England and France have never gone to war with one another without much bloodshed , every innocent drop of which cries out against the wrongdoer who caused such loss of life without good reason . With this in mind , speak , my lord . And I will listen , consider , and earnestly believe that what you say is spoken with a conscience as pure as a newly baptized soul .
I’m coming . Farewell .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne . There is no legal obstacle to your Highness’s claim to France except the following rule , which the French cite from King Pharamond In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant . The French wrongly interpret the Salic land to mean France , and they cite Pharamond as the founder of this law that bars female succession to the throne . But their own authors assert that the Salic land is in Germany , between the Sala and the Elbe rivers , where Charles the Great left behind certain French settlements after conquering the Saxons . The French settlers despised the German women because they were unfaithful to their husbands , so the settlers passed this law that no woman should have right of inheritance in Salic land . And the Salic land the region between the Elbe and the Sala , in Germany , as I said is now called Meissen . It is clear , then , that the Salic law was not
If a quarter of the world were fighting and he were on my side , I’d revolt to fight only him . He’s a lion that I am proud to hunt .
Then , worthy Martius , help Cominius with these wars .
As you promised earlier .
Sir , I did , and I’ll keep my word . Titus Lartius , you’ll see me strike at Tullus’s face once more . Are you hesitating Do you not want to fight
No , Caius Martius , I’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with the other before I stay out of this business .
Oh , you were raised to fight
Let’s go to the capitol . I know our greatest friends wait for us there .
Take the lead .
Follow Cominius , and we’ll follow you . You deserve to go before us .
Noble Martius
Go now to your homes , be gone .
What would you like , sir
I have to leave right away .
That will kill our lovers . We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them . If we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
I must be gone .
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine .
Alas , sir , no , her feelings come from pure love , not cleverness . Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods . She has more storms and tempests in her than a weather almanac . Her temper is not a trick or a skill if it is , she can make it rain as well as Jove .
I have some marks from you on my head and some of my mistress’s marks on my body . But between the both of you , I don’t have a thousand marks . If I gave those marks back to you , chances are you wouldn’t take them as patiently as I did .
Your mistress’s marks What mistress do you have
Your wife , sir . My mistress . At the Phoenix . The one who’s waiting for you to come home for lunch and praying that you’ll get home quickly .
What is this passion that ties up my tongue I can’t speak to her , even though she asked me to . Oh , poor Orlando , you’ve been overthrown Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
What , are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to There , take that , you scoundrel
Good sir , as a friend , I advise you to leave this place . Although you deserve praise , applause , and love , right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done . The duke is temperamental . I’m sure you can imagine what I mean without my having to spell it out .
What are you doing Stop , for God’s sake Well , if you don’t , then I’m out of here .
Thank you , sir . Now please tell me this which of the two ladies who were at the wrestling match is the duke’s daughter
I swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money . They say that this town is full of deception illusionists that can fool the eye , dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind , soul killing witches who can disfigure your body , disguised swindlers , fast talking fakers , and all kinds of other unchecked sins . If this is true , then I’ll be leaving all the sooner . I’ll go to the Centaur to find this servant of mine I fear that my money isn’t safe .
Neither one is his daughter , to judge from their good manners . But really , the smaller one is his daughter . The other is the daughter of the banished duke . Duke Frederick keeps her for his daughter’s sake the love between the two of them is stronger than the bond between sisters . But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece , and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake . I swear , one day the duke’s malice toward Rosalind will suddenly erupt . Goodbye , sir . Later , in a better world than this , I’d love to get to know you .
I sent for you to come speak with me . There were charges against you that might have earned you the death penalty .
I was advised that , since I was working for the army at the time , I shouldn’t go .
The truth is , Sir John , that you are massively notorious .
Anybody who wears a belt this big couldn’t be anything less than massive .
Your bank account is thin , and yet you put it to huge waste .
I wish it were the other way around that my bank account were huge and my waist were thin .
You’ve misled the young Prince .
The young Prince has misled me . I’m the man with the big belly , and he’s the dog who walks in front of me .
I wish I’d never seen her
Then you’d have missed an amazing piece of work , sir , and your trip would have been poorer for the loss .
Exactly . I’ve got plenty of those , just like the hangman has plenty of suits the suits he takes off the dead men he hangs . Damn , I’m as depressed as a tomcat or a dancing bear in chains .
Or an old lion , or a guitar playing a sad lovesong .
Or the wailing of a bagpipe .
How about a rabbit , or a trip to Moorditch
No , let them follow us . The Volsces have a lot of corn . Take these rats to gnaw at their granaries . Worshipful rebels , your courage is impressive , please follow us .
You have a knack for foul images . You are the most metaphorical and rascally , sweet young Prince . But Hal , please stop corrupting me with frivolous matters . I wish to God that you and I knew where we could buy a supply of good reputations . The other day , an elderly lord on the King’s Council came up to me in the street and lectured me about you , but I didn’t pay any attention . He spoke wisely , but I ignored him . But he made sense , and in the street , too .
You did well . You know the scripture Wisdom cries out in the street but no man listens .
Was there ever a man as proud as Martius
He has no equal .
Oh , you have a wicked talent for wrongly quoting scripture , you really could corrupt a saint . You’ve deeply harmed me , Hal , and God forgive you for it Before I met you , I was innocent . And now , if I can speak truly , I’m no better than a sinner . I’ve got to change my life , and I will change my life , by God . If I don’t , I’m an evildoer . I won’t be damned , not for any king’s son in the universe .
When we were chosen as representatives for the people
Did you notice his lip and eyes
No , only his taunts .
When he’s angry , he’ll even taunt the gods .
He’d mock the calmness of the moon .
May this war destroy him His courage has made him too proud .
A nature such as his , which has been amplified by all his successes , disdains his own shadow , which he walks on at noon . I wonder if his pride can handle being under Cominius’s command .
The fame he aims for , and with which he has already been graced , can’t be maintained or increased in any position other than the lead . Whatever goes wrong will be seen as the general’s fault , even though he’ll do the best job a man could do , and fickle public opinion will then say of Martius , Oh , if only he had been in charge
I’m indebted to you . Goodbye .
Out of the frying pan and into the fire from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother But , oh , heavenly Rosalind
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor , speak to me . If you have some secret knowledge of your country’s sad fate which might be avoided if we knew about it then , please , speak . Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere , which they say often makes ghosts restless , then tell us about it . Stay and speak
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though I sent the slave off running . Surely , Luciana , it’s already two o clock .
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch . Sister , let’s eat and stop worrying . A man is master of his own freedom time is his only master , and when the right moment comes along , he’ll come or go as he pleases . If this is so , be patient , sister .
Keep it from leaving , Marcellus .
Why should men be more free than women
Should I strike it with my spear
Because their business lies outside the home .
Listen , when I behave this way toward him , he hates it .
Oh , you should know that he’s the bridle to your will .
Only a mule would agree to that .
Well , I’d rather not open up a wound that’s just healed . The good work you did at Shrewsbury has made up a little for the bad thing you did at Gad’s Hill . You can thank the rebellion for helping you get away with that terrible deed .
Why , too much freedom leads to woe . There’s nothing under heaven that doesn’t have its limits . The beasts on the earth , the fish in the sea , and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control . Men , who are nearest to God , are the masters of all these creatures . And men the lords of the wide
Really
But since things are calm now , let’s keep them that way . We won’t wake a sleeping wolf .
Yes , if it doesn’t stand still .
It’s over here .
Where should we go stealing tomorrow , Jack
Besides , if things go well , public opinion that favors Martius will steal praise away from Cominius .
intended for the realm of France . Nor did the French possess the Salic land until four hundred twenty one years after the death of King Pharamond , incorrectly thought to be the founder of the law . He died in the year 426 , and Charles the Great conquered the Saxons and settled Frenchmen in the region beyond the river Sala in the year 805 . Besides , according to the French historians , King Pepin , who deposed Childeric , based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild , the daughter of King Clothair . Another case Hugh Capet , who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare , daughter of Charlemagne , who was the son of Lewis the Emperor . Another case King Lewis the Tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel , his grandmother , was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare , daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine , by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France . Thus , it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title , Hugh Capet’s claim , and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female .
Indeed , half of all Cominius’s victories have been credited to Martius , though he didn’t win them . And whatever faults Cominius has are seen as Martius’s honors , though Martius really doesn’t have any merit .
For God’s sake , wherever you want , boy . I’ll be one of the gang . If I’m not , call me evildoer and string me up .
Let’s go and hear what’s happening . Let’s see how , our feelings about his personality aside , he prepares for this battle .
Let’s go .
I see you’ve changed your life , alright . From praying to pursesnatching .
It’s gone . We were wrong to threaten it with violence , since it looks so much like a king . Besides , we can’t hurt it anymore than we can hurt the air . Our attack was stupid , futile , and wicked .
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried .
No , that’s not it it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed .
But if you were married , you’d wield some influence .
Before I learn how to love , I’ll learn how to follow orders .
What if your husband strays elsewhere
I’d endure it until he came home again .
Now that’s patience No wonder she’s waiting to get married . It’s easy to preach meekness when you have no reason to act otherwise . When we’re faced with a wretched person , bruised and crying with hardship , we try to get them to shush up . And yet , if we were suffering the same kind of pain , we’d complain just as much if not more So you , who have no husband causing you problems , want to comfort me by preaching the virtue of feeble patience . But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
Fulvia is dead .
To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox .
Pardon me
Well , I’ll get married one day , just to see . Here comes your servant your husband must be coming soon .
What You’re like a candle , half burned out .
Fulvia is dead .
Maybe , if I were a big , fat holiday candle made of animal fat . But you’d be better off saying that I’m a wax candle I keep waxing larger and larger .
Fulvia
Dead .
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks . When a man’s wife dies , he can be comforted by the knowledge that there are replacements to be found . If Fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve . But in this way , grief and comfort appear together . The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose .
What’s going on , Rosalind Cupid have mercy You won’t utter a single word
You follow the young Prince everywhere , like a false angel on his shoulder .
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started .
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog .
The business you began here needs you as well especially the business with Cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
That’s not so , my lord . False angels are light , and anyone can see without having to weigh me that I’m too heavy . But I don’t know in some ways , you’re right . I’m not for these times . Virtue counts for so little in this commercial world of ours . True courage is worthless it’s only used by animal trainers in the bear baiting rings . Intelligence is good for nobody but bartenders , who waste their wits totaling up tavern bills . In these mean spirited days , man’s best qualities aren’t worth a thing . You older folks don’t value us young people . You measure our fiery passion according to your melancholic bitterness . And I have to tell you , those of us who are highly advanced in our youth , we’re spirited as well as young .
No , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs . Throw some of your words at me . Come on , throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog .
You’d add your name to the list of the young You , who have age written all over you Don’t you have mucus in your eyes Dry skin Jaundice A white beard An
Is all of this about your father
No , some of it is about my child’s father . Oh , this working day world is full of thorns
They’re only burrs , cousin , thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior . If we walk on the well worn paths , they won’t get caught in our petticoats .
Those burrs I could shake off my clothing , but these are in my heart .
Cough them up .
I’d try it , if I could cry hem and have him .
To this day , the kings of France follow this unspoken rule , even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line . They prefer to obscure matters rather than reveal how corrupt their own claims to the French crown are . They usurped that crown from you and your ancestors .
Come on , take control of your feelings .
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim
If not , mighty sovereign , let the blame be mine . For it is written in the book of Numbers When the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter . Gracious lord , claim what is yours . Unfurl your banners of war . Take your mighty ancestors as models . Go to the tomb of your great grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives . Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince , your great uncle , who fought a tragic battle on French soil , routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop , smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen . O noble English , who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces , leaving the other half to stand by , idle and laughing .
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again . You are their heir and sit on their throne , and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins . You , my most powerful sovereign , are in the very prime of youth , ripe for glorious deeds and great enterprises .
It’s my calling , Hal . It’s no sin for a man to follow his calling .
Poins Now we’ll find out whether Mr . Gadshill has planned a robbery . If good deeds bring a man to heaven , there’s no hell hot enough for Poins . This is the most incredible villain , whoever said Stick em up to an honest man .
Morning , Ned .
Morning , sweet Hal . What’s Mr . Feelbad got to say What’s going on , Sir John , Wino Jack How’s your deal with the devil coming along You sold him your soul last Good Friday for some cold chicken and a glass of cheap wine , right
The devil will get what’s coming to him . Sir John’s a man of his word , and he never disagrees with a proverb . He will give the devil his due .
Then you’re damned for keeping your word with the devil .
Enough of this frivolous talk . Give our officers notice of our intentions . I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave . Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return . Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar . His fleet controls the sea . Our fickle citizens who never reward service until that service is over are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the Great to his son , Sextus . Sextus has great honor and power , and his spirit and energy are even greater , all of which makes him the most formidable soldier in the empire . The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential . There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full fledged threats . Like horse’s hairs dropped in a bucket of water , they come alive like snakes but as yet they bear no poison . Relay our intentions to the officers who will be in charge of the move .
Tell me , is your tardy master close at hand
No but he came at me with two hands just ask my ears .
Did you talk to him Do you know his plans
Yes , yes , he told me his plans on my ears . Damn his hands I could barely understand it .
No he hit me very clearly and I felt his punches perfectly well . They were so dreadful , I could barely stand up under them .
But please , tell me is he coming home It seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
Why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
Horns You bastard
I don’t mean he’s cuckold mad . But he sure is angry . When I asked him to come home to lunch , he asked me for a thousand marks . It’s lunchtime , I said . My gold , he said . The meat’s burning , I said . My gold , he said . Will you come home I said .
So Aufidius , your opinion is that the Romans have spied on our council meetings and know how we proceed .
Don’t you agree Haven’t all the plans we’ve ever discussed here that could be put into action against Rome been thwarted Not even four days have gone by since I heard from the field , these are the words I think I have the letter here yes , here it is .
Sir , I was born around three o clock in the afternoon , with a white head and a bit of a round belly . As for my scratchy voice , I lost it through shouting and singing loud songs . But I won’t try to prove how young I am any longer . I have only one trait of old age , and that is wisdom . If somebody wants to challenge me to a dance contest for a thousand mark wager , let him hand me the money and off we go . Now , as for the fact that the Prince hit you on the head , he did it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible gentleman . I reprimanded him for it , and he repents . He’s not wearing the traditional sackcloth and ashes , for sure , but he’s repenting in silk cloth and wine .
May God send the Prince a better friend
They’ve raised an army , but it’s not known whether they will march east or west . The famine is serious , the people are rebelling , and it’s rumored that Cominius , your old enemy Martius who the Romans hate worse than you and Titus Lartius , a most valiant Roman , these three lead the attack , wherever it’s headed . Most likely toward you . Think about it .
Well , the King has separated you and Prince Harry . I hear you’re going with John of Lancaster to go fight Northumberland and the Archbishop .
Yes , and thanks for reminding me . I hope that all of you who stay home , safe and sound , will say a prayer that we soldiers don’t end up in some hot battle . For , by the Lord , I’ve only packed two shirts , and I don’t want to sweat too much . If things get hot and I pull out any other weapon besides a bottle , I’ll never drink wine again . I get sent out on every dangerous assignment
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself .
The other kings throughout the world all expect you to take the offensive , just like your lion hearted forebears .
Oh , that’s a good wish You’ll fight with him eventually , and fall . But let’s put these jokes aside for a moment , and speak earnestly . Is it possible that you could have fallen in love with Orlando , Sir Rowland’s youngest son , this suddenly
They know your Grace has justification , as well as the money and military strength . And so you do . No king of England was ever backed by wealthier nobles or more loyal subjects . Their bodies may remain here in England , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already .
The duke , my father , loved his father very much .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear king , to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire . And to that end , we , the clergy , will raise your Highness a sum greater than your ancestors were ever given at any one time .
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son By that kind of logic , I should hate Orlando , since my father hates his father . But I don’t hate Orlando .
We must not only arm ourselves to invade France , but must also apportion troops to defend against invasion by the Scots , who will see this as a perfect opportunity to attack .
I will .
No , please don’t hate him for my sake .
Your subjects in the north , gracious sovereign , will provide a wall of defense against Scottish thieves across the border .
Why shouldn’t I Doesn’t he deserve it
Let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because I do . Look , here comes the duke .
He looks angry .
Madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
Me , uncle
You , niece . In ten days time , if you’re found within twenty miles of the court , you’ll die for it .
His only other choice is to be damned for cheating the devil .
But boys , boys Four o clock tomorrow morning some pilgrims are going to pass by Gad’s Hill . They’ll be on their way to Canterbury Cathedral with expensive offerings , and traders will be heading to London with bags of money . I’ve got masks for you , you’ve got horses for yourselves . Mr . Gadshill is spending tonight in Rochester , and I’ve already ordered tomorrow night’s dinner in Eastcheap . We could do this in our sleep . If you come , I’ll make you rich . If not , stay home and hang yourselves .
Listen , Yedward . If I stay home and don’t go , I’ll hang you for going .
Hal , are you in
Who Me , a robber Me , a thief Not me . No way .
If you don’t dare to fight for ten shillings , there’s no honesty , manhood , or friendship in you , and you never came from royal blood .
Well , okay . For once in my life , I’ll be a little crazy .
Where is he
Well , you know what I’ll stay home .
I haven’t seen him recently .
Find out where he is , who’s with him , and what he’s doing . Don’t tell him I sent you . If he’s sad , tell him I’m dancing . If he’s happy , say that I’ve suddenly taken sick . Hurry , and come back .
Madam , I think if you love him so much , you aren’t using the best way to get him to reciprocate .
What should I do that I’m not doing
Always give him his way . Never contradict him .
Don’t push him too far . I wish you’d be patient . We come to hate that which controls us .
But here comes Antony .
I am sick and sullen .
I’m sorry to have to say this
And then it acted startled , like a guilty person caught by the law . I’ve heard that the rooster awakens the god of day with its trumpetlike crowing , and makes all wandering ghosts , wherever they are , hurry back to their hiding places . We’ve just seen proof of that .
Yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed . Some people say that just before Christmas the rooster crows all night long , so that no ghost dares go wandering , and the night is safe . The planets have no sway over us , fairies spells don’t work , and witches can’t bewitch us . That’s how holy that night is .
Yes , I’ve heard the same thing and sort of believe it . But look , morning is breaking beyond that hill in the east , turning the sky red . Let’s interrupt our watch and go tell young Hamlet what we’ve seen tonight . I’m sure this ghost that’s so silent with us will speak to him . Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love
Let’s do it . I know where we’ll find him this morning .
Please , your Grace , tell me what crime I have committed . If I know my own thoughts and desires , and I’m not dreaming or crazy which I’m sure I’m not then , dear uncle , I’ve never had so much as a half formed thought that would have offended you .
All traitors protest like this . If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent , they’d all be as innocent as God Himself . I don’t trust you . Enough said .
But your mistrust alone can’t make me a traitor on what basis do you suspect me
You are your father’s daughter . That’s enough .
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom . I was his daughter when you banished him . Treason is not inherited , my lord . But even if we did inherit it from our family , what does that have to do with me My father wasn’t a traitor . So , please , my lord , don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor , with no titles to my name .
Dear master , listen to me .
Yes , Celia , we kept her here for your sake . Otherwise , she would have been banished with her father .
Now , my dearest Queen
But the country was more frightened than hurt , my liege . Take this example when all its knights have been in France and all its noblemen absent , England has not only defended itself well , but actually seized the Scottish king and penned him up like a stray dog . Then he was sent off to France . He enhanced King Edward’s fame , adding royalty to his captives and thus making England’s own history as rich with glory as the muddy floor of the sea is rich with sunken ships and innumerable treasures .
Please , stand farther away from me .
But here’s an old , true saying If you want to win France , start with Scotland . For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey , the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and , like the mouse when the cat’s away , destroy more than she can actually eat .
What’s the matter
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news . What , does your wife say you can come home I wish she’d never let you come . Don’t let her say I kept you . I have no power over you . You belong to her .
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home . But that is a false conclusion , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves . While the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home . For though the state is divided into different levels and functions , it all works in agreement for a unified purpose , a natural and perfect end such as we find in music .
The gods know
Cleopatra
How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true , even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves you , who were unfaithful to Fulvia It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart . Such false vows are broken as soon as they are spoken .
Most sweet Queen
No , please don’t try to excuse your departure . Just say good bye and go . When you begged to stay , that was the time for words . You didn’t want to go then You saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows . Then , all my parts seemed angelic to you . My features are still that beautiful or else you , the greatest soldier in the world , have become the greatest liar by overpraising them .
You thought it was wise to keep your plans secret until they needed to be revealed , but it seems that the Romans knew your plans as soon as they were hatched . Since they know our intention , we can’t proceed as we had planned to capture as many towns as possible before the Romans knew we were moving toward them .
Noble Aufidius , do your duty . Go to your men . Leave us here to guard Corioles ourselves . If they attack us , bring your army back before they take the city , but I think you’ll find they haven’t prepared for us .
May the gods assist you
that comes up . Well , I can’t live forever . That’s the thing about the English when they have something good , they use it continually . If you’re going to insist that I’m an old man , then let me rest . I wish to God the enemy weren’t as scared of me as they are I’d rather sit and rust than be worn out by all this work .
Well , stay honest , stay honest . God bless your undertaking .
Could your lordship lend me a thousand pounds for some equipment I need
Not a penny , not a penny you’re too impatient to endure adversity . Farewell give my regards to my kinsman Westmoreland .
If I do , hit me with a sledgehammer . Old age and greed go together like youth and lust . Gout afflicts one and syphilis plagues the other , so there’s no point in me cursing either the old or the young they’re both cursed already . Boy
Sir
How much money’s in my wallet
There no way to cure the illness that’s making my wallet waste away borrowing makes it live a little longer , but the disease is incurable . Bring this letter to Lord John of Lancaster , this one to the Prince , this one to Westmoreland , and this one to Madame Ursula . I’ve promised to marry her every single week since I got my first gray hair . Get going you know where I’ll be .
What do you mean , lady
I wish I were as big and strong as you . Then you’d see the courage that lives in the Queen of Egypt .
Listen to me , Queen . There is an emergency I must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you . My Italy is full of civil war . Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome . When two domestic opponents are equally matched as we are against Pompey factions will form on the smallest of pretexts . When a formerly hated man grows powerful , he suddenly finds himself with many supporters . Pompey , who was once condemned , now wields his father’s power , and all the citizens who have grievances against the government are joining him . Pompey’s numbers are steadily growing , and the government is ready to do something desperate . But my personal motivation and that which should move you most to sanction my departure is that Fulvia is dead .
I may not have outlived the foolishness of my youth , but I’m not that childishly naïve . Is it possible Fulvia is dead
She’s dead , my Queen .
She’s too devious for you . Her smoothness , her silence , and her patient suffering appeal to the people , and they pity her . You’re a fool . She’s robbing you of the attention you deserve . You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture . So be quiet . The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable . She is banished .
Then lay that sentence on me too , my lord . I cannot live without her .
Oh , my poor Rosalind , where will you go Do you want to exchange fathers I’ll give you mine . I insist , don’t be more distressed than I am .
I have more reason to be distressed .
Look at this . Take your royal time and read about the quarrels she encouraged . And saving the best for last , read when and where she died .
Cut my corset laces , Charmian , so I can breathe . Hurry No , leave it alone . I waver easily between sickness and health . Just as Antony loves .
That is why God divided humanity into various functions , so as to keep human endeavor moving ever forward , the one single fixed element the aim being obedience . Honey bees operate in just such a communal way . In fact , you can learn a lot about how to run a well ordered kingdom from these creatures . They have a king and officers of sorts . Some , like magistrates , dole out punishment at home , while others venture forth for commerce , like merchants . Still others , armed like soldiers with stingers , pillage the summer flowers , bringing the booty triumphantly home to the royal tent of their emperor , who is preoccupied with governing . The emperor supervises the masons as they build gold roofs , the ordinary citizens as they process the honey , the humble laborers as they crowd through the city’s narrow gate with their heavy burdens , and the solemn looking judge as he delivers lazy , unproductive drones to pale executioners . From this , I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end just as many arrows , shot from different points , converge on a single target just as many roads meet in a single town just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea just as the many radiuses of a sundial unite at its center . Just so , a thousand actions , once set in motion , will result in one desired object , and all will be well carried out and have a successful end . Therefore , head to France , my liege Divide your lucky England into four . If you take even one quarter with you to France , you will nevertheless make the whole country shake .
Control yourself , my precious Queen , and concede that my love is true . It has endured many genuine trials .
That’s what Fulvia told me . I beg you , turn away and cry for her . Then say good bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit . Good . Now perform a scene for me , using your excellent skills of playacting , and pretend that you’re being honorable and righteous .
My gold , he said . Where’s the thousand marks I gave you , scoundrel The pig , I said , is burned . My gold , he said . My mistress , I said . Damn your mistress I don’t know your mistress , the hell with your mistress
Who said that
My master said it . I don’t know , he said , any house , wife , or mistress . My message , which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth , ended up being carried back home by my shoulders . Because at the end of it all , that’s where he beat me .
Go back again , slave , and bring him home .
Go back again , to be beaten home again For God’s sake , send somebody else .
Go back , slave , or I’ll knock you one across the head .
I don’t care .
And he’ll add another knock across . With all these crosses , I’ll have a holy head .
Sir John , do me a favor leave me and the Prince alone . I’ll spell out such good reasons for this adventure , he’s sure to join .
May God give you the power of persuasion and him the good sense to listen , so that what you say will affect him and what he hears will sink in . This way , the true prince will turn into false thief , just for laughs . After all , all the poor , little vices of the age need encouragement . So long you’ll find me in Eastcheap .
Farewell , you second spring Farewell , you summer in November
Although I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder Hamlet’s death , and though it was proper to mourn him throughout our kingdom , life still goes on I think it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own well being . Therefore , I’ve married my former sister in law , the queen , with mixed feelings of happiness and sadness . I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing what all of you have wisely advised all along for which I thank you . Now , down to business . You all know what’s happening . Young Fortinbras , underestimating my strength or imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into turmoil , dreams of getting the better of me , and never stops pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father lost to the elder Hamlet , my dead brother in law . So much for Fortinbras .
Look at you You have impatience all over your face .
You’ll make me angry . No more of this .
I know you can do better than that , but it’ll do for now .
I swear by my sword
Damn this gout Or damn this syphilis One of them is really messing up my big toe . Oh well , it doesn’t matter if I limp . I can blame it on the war , and that will help justify my disability payments . A sharp brain can turn any problem to its advantage . I’ll turn my diseases into cash .
Swear by your shield , too He’s getting better , but still it’s not his best . See , Charmian , how well this mighty Roman portrays anger
I’ll leave you , lady .
Polite sir , let me say one thing . Sir , you and I must part company no , that’s not it . Sir , you and I were lovers no , that’s not it , either . You already know all that . There’s something I’d like to oh , I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say . Just as Antony has forgotten me .
If you weren’t the queen of immaturity , I’d think you were immaturity itself .
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me . Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them . Your honor is the reason you are leaving . So I beg you not to listen to my foolishness . May the gods be with you . May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
Now , my good sweet honey sir , come with us tomorrow . I have an idea for a practical joke , and I can’t do it by myself . Falstaff , Peto , Bardolph , and Mr . Gadshill will rob the travelers we’re planning to ambush , but you and I won’t be there . If you and I don’t rob them once they have the loot , then chop off my head
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .
We’ll leave before them , or after them . We’ll tell them to meet us someplace , but then we won’t show up . They’ll pull off the robbery by themselves , and the second they’ve done it , we’ll attack them .
Let’s go . Come with me . Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here , you come with me , and even though I leave here , I stay with you .
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
Sure , but they’ll recognize our horses , our clothes , and all our other things .
Now I’ve made up my mind , and with God’s help and yours , you nobles who are the mainstay of my power I’ll force France to fear me , or I’ll break her into pieces , as she’s rightfully mine . Either I’ll sit , ruling with absolute authority over France and all her dukedoms , or I’ll lay these bones in a common grave , with no stone or inscription over them . Either the story of my deeds will be declaimed loudly and without restraint , or else my grave will remain speechless , like a Turkish mute , not honored with even an epitaph etched in wax .
I’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him , not the king .
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey Or should we be tactful and only hint at what the Dauphin sent us to say
Farewell .
Farewell .
No you haven’t , cousin . Please , be cheerful . Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter
No , he hasn’t .
Oh , he hasn’t Well , then , you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one . Will we be separated Should we part , sweet girl No . Let my father find another heir . So , help me plan how we’ll escape , where we’ll go , and what we’ll take with us . Don’t even try to take this all upon yourself , bearing your grief alone and leaving me out . I swear by the heavens , which have grown pale in sympathy with us , I’m going with you , whatever you say .
But where will we go
To the Forest of Arden , to find your father .
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt . You do the same , and we’ll be able to travel without attracting any attackers attention .
Wouldn’t it be better since I’m unusually tall for a woman to dress myself like a man I’ll wear a big sword in my belt , carry a boar spear in my hand , and hide all my womanish fear in my heart . We’ll maintain a swaggering , warrior look , like so many cowardly men , whose manner has nothing to do with what they’re feeling .
Farewell .
So that’s what we’re fighting for , and that’s the kind of support we have . Now please , my noble friends , tell me frankly if you think we have a chance . First you , Marshal Mowbray . What do you say
Now you’ll see , Lepidus , that I don’t disdain our noble ally because of a personal whim . Here’s the news from Alexandra Antony fishes , drinks , and celebrates all night . He’s become as frivolous and self indulgent as Ptolemy’s queen , Cleopatra . He rarely attends to his duties or acknowledges he has partners to be considered . Here’s a man who is the epitome of all the vices known to man .
I absolutely agree with our reasons for fighting . But given our resources , I’d feel better if I knew how we’re going to grow bold and strong enough to defeat this mighty and powerful King .
I can’t believe there could be enough vice in the world to outshine all the good in him . His faults stand out because they must be compared to all his virtues , like stars that shine brightly against the dark night sky . They’re more likely to be the result of inherited weakness than independent choice .
Our army has grown to twenty five thousand good men . Our reinforcements are coming with Northumberland , and his heart burns with anger over all he’s lost .
Then , Lord Hastings , this is the question can our twenty five thousand get the job done without Northumberland
With him , we can .
You’re too forgiving . Let’s say , for argument’s sake , that it’s not improper to fool around with Ptolemy’s wife , or to trade a kingdom for a joke . That it’s fine to engage in drinking matches with inferiors , or stumble drunkenly through the streets in the middle of the day , or get into fist fights with sweaty servants . Even if we said that this behavior suits him though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself . If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits , then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases , and that’s his business . But he’s wasting time and resources vital to our cause and endangering both his position and ours . He should be chastised , like any boy who knows what’s right but chooses to satisfy his desires regardless .
What should I call you when you’re a man
Something that refers to my current state . Instead of Celia , call me Aliena .
I’ve written to Fortinbras’s uncle , the present head of Norway , an old bedridden man who knows next to nothing about his nephew’s plans . I’ve told the uncle to stop those plans , which he has the power to do , since all the troops assembled by young Fortinbras are Norwegian , and thus under the uncle’s control . I’m giving the job of delivering this letter to you , good Cornelius , and you , Voltemand . Your business in Norway will be limited to this task . Now good bye . Show your loyalty by leaving quickly , rather than with elaborate speeches .
Cousin , what if we brought that clownish fool of your father’s court , Touchstone Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels
We’ll do our duty to you in that and everything else .
He’d walk the whole wide world with me . Leave me alone to go convince him . Let’s go gather our jewels and money . We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards , whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone . Now , we go contentedly to freedom not banishment .
I have no doubt you will . Good bye .
And now , Laertes , what do you have to tell me You have a favor you to ask of me . What is it , Laertes You’ll never waste your words when talking to the king of Denmark . What could you ever ask for that I wouldn’t give you Your father and the Danish throne are as close as the mind and the heart , or the hand and the mouth . What would you like , Laertes
Here’s more news .
My lord , I want your permission to go back to France , which I left to come to Denmark for your coronation . I confess , my thoughts are on France , now that my duty is done . Please , let me go .
We’ve followed your commands , lord Caesar . You shall have hourly updates regarding the situation at sea . Pompey has a strong navy . All the people who only stayed with you out of fear are gathering at the port to join him , in the opinion he’s been treated unfairly .
I am no tyrant but a Christian king , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons . Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint .
I should have known it . It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized . People will transfer their support to a strong figure until he becomes their actual leader . Then they will value their former leader , even though the loss of their support has made him powerless . The common crowd changes like the tide , to and fro , serving whoever is on the rise . Their power is worn away by their fickleness .
Here it is then , in as few words as possible . Your Highness recently sent word to France claiming certain dukedoms as your own , in the name of your great ancestor , King Edward the Third . By way of answer , the prince our master says that you’re acting like the immature youth that you are . He warns you to take note there’s nothing in France that you can win by dancing . You can’t party your way into dukedoms there . He therefore sends you this casket of treasure as a gift more suited to your character . And in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms . This is the Dauphin’s message .
What’s the treasure , uncle
Tennis balls , my liege .
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor . Thank you for his present and your trouble . Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls , I’ll play a set in France , God willing , that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court . Tell him he’s got himself such a willing opponent that we’ll be chasing balls all over France . And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days . He doesn’t realize how useful they were to me . For a long time , I didn’t value this humble throne of England , and therefore lived at some remove and gave myself over to riotous living . Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home . But tell the Dauphin I will retain the dignity of kingship and appear all the more royal and glorious on the throne of France . Precisely for this purpose I went about like a commoner and experienced the life of the ordinary man . Now I’ll rise there with
Caesar , I have news about Menecrates and Menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships . They’ve made many raids upon Italy and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them . The young , energetic men are joining Pompey . These pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor , since the simple mention of the name Pompey carries as much power as a fleet of troops in battle .
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him . Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks That’s because he has squandered my beauty . Am I boring Have I lost my wit If my conversation is no longer free and clever , that’s because he’s dulled it I’m like a sharp tool he’s blunted with a hard piece of marble . Is he charmed by their pretty clothes Well , that’s not my fault he’s the one in charge of my spending . What faults can you find in me that weren’t first caused by him One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty . But like an unruly deer , he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures . I am nothing but a poor , used fool .
This jealousy is harming only you Drive it out of you .
Now , my companions and brothers in exile , hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues Out here we feel the changing of the seasons , but we’re not bothered by it . When the icy fangs of the brutal , scolding wind bite and blow on my body , even though I’m shivering with cold , I can appreciate the weather’s honesty . I smile and think , Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of . Adversity can have its benefits like the ugly , poisonous toad that wears a precious jewel in its forehead . In this life , far away from the civilized world , we can hear the language of the trees , read the books of the running streams , hear sermons in the stones , and discover the good in every single thing .
Only someone who doesn’t feel this pain could tell me to ignore it . I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn’t he be here Sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace . I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me . Even the best jewel can be tarnished . Gold , however , can’t be corrupted though it can be worn down if it’s touched too often . And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior . Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband , I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping .
I wouldn’t change my situation for anything . You’re lucky , my lord , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you .
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy
That’s right , Lord Bardolph . That’s what happened to young Hotspur at Shrewsbury .
Psh They won’t see our horses , because I’ll tie them in the forest . We’ll put on new masks after we leave them . And , just for this occasion , I’ve made cloaks out of rough buckram cloth , to cover our regular clothes .
Okay . But I’m afraid they’ll be too tough for us .
That’s true , my lord . Hotspur fortified himself with nothing but hope , and mistook empty words as a true promise of reinforcements . He imagined that a huge army was coming to his aid , but what actually arrived turned out to be even smaller than the smallest of his fantasies . And so , with daydreams that could only belong to a madman , he closed his eyes and leaped into destruction .
Well , I know that two of them are the biggest cowards who ever turned and ran . As for the third , if he fights even a second longer than is absolutely necessary , I promise to never fight again . The best part about this joke will be listening to the outlandish lies this fat clown will tell when we meet for dinner how he fought at least thirty men , how he defended himself , how he got hit , what he endured . The funniest part will be when we call him on it .
Okay . I’ll go . Get everything together and meet me in Eastcheap tomorrow . I’ll eat there . Farewell .
Antony , it’s time to stop your wild hedonism . When you were defeated at the battle of Modena where you killed the consuls , Hirtius and Pansa and then driven away , you had to face hunger and thirst . And even though you were brought up as a gentleman , you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand . You drank horses’ urine and water from scum covered puddles that even animals would refuse . Though you were used to the finest foods , you didn’t turn up your nose at the bitterest berries on the thorniest bushes . You even ate bark from trees , as deer do in winter . Going over the Alps , you ate strange meat that some men would rather die than consume . And you went through all this the comparison between then and now shames you in such a soldier like way that you didn’t seem to suffer at all .
It’s too bad .
I understand all of you . For now , I’ll put on the rowdy behavior of your good for nothing ways . But in this way , I’ll be like the sun , who allows the vulgar , corrupting clouds to hide his beauty from the world . Then , when the sun wants to be himself again , he breaks through the foul mists and vapors that seemed to be strangling him .
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly . It’s time that we brought our armies into the field . Let’s call a council of war immediately . Pompey is making the most of our absence .
My son has worn me down by asking me so many times . In the end I grudgingly consented . I beg you , let him go .
Please , my daughter in law , sing or express yourself more cheerfully . If my son were my husband , I would be happier with him away winning honors than lovingly embracing me in bed . Before he was full grown , when he was still my only child , when he was boyishly handsome and attracting much attention , when even if the king begged me I shouldn’t have let him out of my sight for an hour , I considered how honored he would become , and that unless he were inspired to make a name for himself , he would be no better than a picture hanging on the wall , so I happily let him face danger , because that’s how he was likely to find fame . I sent him to a cruel war from which he returned crowned with garlands of oak . I tell you , daughter in law , I jumped for joy more to see that he had proven himself as a man than I did when I first heard he was a boy child .
In that case , leave when you like , Laertes , and spend your time however you wish . I hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time . And now , Hamlet , my nephew and my son
But if had he died in the war , madam , how would you feel then
Too many family ties there for me .
Then his noble deeds would have been my son in them I would have found my legacy . Listen to me seriously if I had a dozen sons and loved them equally , as much as I love our Martius , I would rather that eleven of them die nobly for their country than one choose the pleasures of making love over doing his duty .
Why are you still so gloomy , with a cloud hanging over you
It’s not true , sir . Your son is out in the sun .
My dear Hamlet , stop wearing these black clothes , and be friendly to the king . You can’t spend your whole life with your eyes to the ground remembering your noble father . It happens all the time , what lives must die eventually , passing to eternity .
Yes , mother , it happens all the time .
So why does it seem so particular to you
Come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner It bothers me , though , that these poor spotted innocents , who , after all , are this deserted city’s native citizens , should be gouged with arrows .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war .
But , begging your pardon , there’s no harm in making guesses and hopeful strategies .
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime . Good bye .
Don’t worry , that goes without saying .
Yes , there is . Presently , our armies are already in motion , but putting our hope in them is as ridiculous as expecting that early spring buds will produce fruit at that time of year , buds are more likely to be killed by frost than to bloom . When we want to put up a building , first we survey the land , and then we draw up a set of plans . Then we calculate the cost , and if we can’t afford it , we revise the plans with fewer rooms , or we decide not to build at all . In the great task we’re attempting the taking down of one kingdom , and the building of another we have even more reason to evaluate the land and the plans . We must be certain that the foundation is sound , that the engineer is skilled . We must know precisely what we can afford , how ready and able we are , and we must consider the opposing arguments .
Charmian
Madam
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur , and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me . I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier . Here he comes .
Ah , give me some mandragora to drink .
Why , madam
So , sir . Are you over your ridiculous mood If you like being hit , crack some more jokes . You never heard of the Centaur You weren’t given any gold Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner The Phoenix is my house Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly
Said what , sir When did I say all that
You think about him too much .
Just now . Right here . Less than half an hour ago .
That’s treason
I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
I hope not , Madam .
Eunuch Mardian
You moron , you denied having any gold , and you told me about a mistress and a lunch . And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it .
What can I do for your highness
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood . But what’s the joke Please , master , tell me .
I don’t want to hear you sing . I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do . It’s a good thing for you that , being castrated , you can better concentrate on my needs . Do you have desires
And because people have missed him so much , they are that much more impressed when he finally appears . If every day were a vacation , playing would grow as tedious as working . But when it’s rare , it’s looked forward to . Nothing is as precious as the unexpected occurrence . So when I throw off this wild behavior and accept the responsibilities of being king a destiny I didn’t choose but was born into I’ll suddenly seem like a far better man . In this way , I’ll give everyone the wrong expectation of me . Like a bright metal on a dark background , my reformation will shine even more brilliantly when it’s set against my wicked past . I’ll be so wild , I’ll make wildness an art form , then redeem myself when the world least expects me to .
Seem , mother No , it is . I don’t know what you mean by seem . Neither my black clothes , my dear mother , nor my heavy sighs , nor my weeping , nor my downcast eyes , nor any other display of grief can show what I really feel . It’s true that all these things seem like grief , since a person could use them to fake grief if he wanted to . But I’ve got more real grief inside me that you could ever see on the surface . These clothes are just a hint of it .
Well , not in deed , madam , since I can’t do anything unchaste . But I do have intense passions and I do think about what Venus did with Mars .
Hamlet , you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father like this . But you have to remember , that your father lost his father , who lost his father before him , and every time , each son has had to mourn his father for a certain period . But overdoing it is just stubborn . It’s not manly . It’s not what God wants , and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and weak mind . Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later , why should we take it to heart You’re committing a crime against heaven , against the dead , and against nature . And it’s irration al , since the truth is that all fathers must die . Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father .
Oh , Charmian , where do you think he is now Is he standing or sitting Or is he walking Or is he on his horse Oh , how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him . Do well , horse . Do you know whom it is you carry A man who carries responsibility for a third of the world on his shoulders . He’s speaking now , or perhaps he’s whispering , Where’s my serpent of the Nile For that’s his pet name for me . I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . . Are you thinking about me Even though I’ve been darkened by the sun and wrinkled with age Caesar , with your broad forehead , when you were alive , I was the perfect young consort for a king . And powerful Pompey used to stare at me as if he were frozen in time .
such glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France . I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be struck blind . And tell the laughing prince that this joke of his has transformed his tennis balls into cannon balls , and the destructive vengeance they bring with them will be his responsibility . His mocking will mock many thousands of widows out of their husbands . It will mock mothers out of their sons , and mock castles down . There are people yet unborn and unconceived who will have reason to curse the Dauphin’s scorn . But all this lies with God , to whom I do appeal . In God’s name , inform the Dauphin I am coming , to avenge myself and to put forth my rightful hand in a sanctified cause . So go in peace . And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it . Give them safe conduct . Farewell .
That was a humorous message .
Queen of Egypt , greetings
You are nothing like Mark Antony But since you come from him , you’re saturated with his healing spirit . How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony
Indeed , my lord , the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths . He swears that when you kill the deer , you’re a worse usurper than your brother was for banishing you . Today , Lord Amiens and I followed Jaques . We saw him lie down along a brook under an oak tree whose ancient roots peeked out from the earth . A poor , lonely stag who had been hurt by a hunter’s arrow came to rest there , where he heaved such heavy groans that the effort seemed to stretch his hide to bursting . Big , round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose . The hairy fool , watched closely by sad Jaques , stood on the very edge of the brook , adding his own tears to the streaming water .
The last thing he did before sending me off , dear Queen , was to kiss the last of many such kisses this Indian pearl for you .
And what did Jaques say Didn’t he take the opportunity to draw a moral from the scene
His speech is stored in my heart .
My ear must pull it out .
Oh , yes , he created a thousand comparisons . First , he spoke of the deer’s needless addition to the stream’s water supply . Poor deer , he said , you’re just like a human you add more to what already has too much . Then , about the deer’s being alone , abandoned by his velvety companions It’s appropriate , he said , that a miserable creature should excuse itself from company . Just then , a carefree herd of deer , having just eaten their fill of pasture grass , bounded along without stopping to greet their wounded brother . Sure , said Jaques , hurry on , you fat and greasy citizens . Why stop and notice this poor , broken , bankrupt creature here In this way , he most insightfully pierced to the heart of the country , the city , the court , and even our lives out here in the forest , swearing that we are mere usurpers and tyrants , frightening and killing animals in their own homes .
Good friend , he said , say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt , and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire . Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen . Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply .
Was he sad or happy
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold he was neither sad nor happy .
Madam , the Lady Valeria has come to see you .
May I please be excused to have some time alone
Because everyone knows that you are the man closest to this throne , and I love you just as much as any father loves his son . And your plans for going back to Wittenberg are not what I want . I’m asking you now to stay here in my company as the number one member of my court , my nephew and now my son too .
Please answer my prayers , Hamlet , and stay with us . Don’t go back to Wittenberg .
No , you may not . I think I hear your husband’s drum coming toward us . He must have plucked out all Aufidius’s hairs so the Volsces will avoid him the way children run from a bear . I think I see him stamping like this , and calling like this Come on , you cowards You were born in fear even though you were born in Rome . He’s wiping his bloody forehead with his armored hand . He’s unrelenting like a laborer who must harvest a whole field or not be paid at all .
I’ve been too calm and even tempered , unwilling to react angrily to these indignities . You have discovered this , and so you’ve walked all over my patience . Know this from now on , I’m going to be my royal self again , powerful and frightening . My natural condition , which was as smooth as oil and soft as feathers , has lost me the respect that powerful people only pay to the similarly powerful .
I’ll obey you as well as I can , ma am .
My lord , the Percy family does not deserve to bear the brunt of your anger and power , especially since we helped you become so powerful in the first place .
That’s the right answer it shows your love . Stay in Denmark like us . My dear wife , come . Hamlet’s agreeing to stay makes me happy , and every merry toast I’ll drink today will be heard as far as the clouds overhead . My drinking will be echoed in the heavens . Let’s go .
Your Highness
Heavens protect my husband from the deadly Aufidius
Worcester , get out . I see danger and disobedience in your eyes . You carry yourself too boldly and proudly , and royalty should never have to endure a servant’s frowning face . You have my permission to leave now . When I need you or your advice , I’ll call for you .
He’ll beat Aufidius’s head down below his knees and then stand on his neck .
Ah , I wish my dirty flesh could melt away into a vapor , or that God had not made a law against suicide . Oh God , God How tired , stale , and pointless life is to me . Damn it It’s like a garden that no one’s taking care of , and that’s growing wild . Only nasty weeds grow in it now . I can’t believe it’s come to this . My father’s only been dead for two months no , not even two . Such an excellent king , as superior to my uncle as a god is to a beast , and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind from blowing too hard on her face .
You were about to speak .
Oh , what an even disposition he has Observe , observe good Charmian That’s exactly how he is Just notice . He wasn’t sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others . He wasn’t merry , because to be merry would indicate that he had forgotten his love in Egypt . He was somewhere in the middle , between them . . . Oh , heavenly mixture Whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . . Did you meet my messengers on your way here
Yes , madam , twenty different messengers . Why did you send so many
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar . Bring ink and paper , Charmian . Welcome , my good Alexas . Charmian , did I ever love Caesar as much as this
May you choke on any other sentiments like that Say , That splendid Antony .
The courageous Caesar
By Isis , I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony , my best man among men .
We did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
I hope to make the sender blush for it . Now , lords , don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition . My thoughts are now bent entirely on France except my thoughts about God , who takes precedence over this undertaking . Therefore , let’s set about mustering the requisite number of troops and give consideration to anything that can be expected to speed our enterprise . For , with God on our side , we’ll chastise this prince on his father’s own doorstep . Therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
Take me to him . I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits , because then he always has a lot to say .
I’ll bring you to him right away .
Pardon me , but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said .
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was . Go get me ink and paper . He shall have different messages every day if I have to depopulate Egypt to send them .
Oh God , do I have to remember that She would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him she couldn’t get enough of him . Yet even so , within a month of my father’s death , even before she had broken in the shoes she wore to his funeral , crying like crazy even an animal would have mourned its mate longer than she did there she was marrying my uncle , my father’s brother , who’s about as much like my father as I’m like Hercules . Less than a month after my father’s death , even before the tears on her cheeks had dried , she remarried . Oh , so quick to jump into a bed of incest That’s not good , and no good can come of it either . But my heart must break in silence , since I can’t mention my feelings aloud .
Hello , sir .
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave . Her ladies in waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
Nice to see you again , Horatio that is your name , right
That’s me , sir . Still your respectful servant .
Not my servant , but my friend . I’ll change that name for you . But what are you doing so far from Wittenberg , Horatio Oh , Marcellus
Hello , sir .
Yes , my Lord . The prisoners you asked for , which my son Harry Percy captured at Holmedon , were not kept from you in anger . He’s already told you that . Whoever told you my son meant to defy you was either mistaken or trying to make trouble . He’s done nothing wrong .
Sir , I didn’t hold back any prisoners . But I remember this when the battle ended , I was exhausted with rage and exertion . I was out of breath , dizzy and bent over . All of a sudden a man approached me , neat , clean , and tidily dressed , like a bridegroom . His beard was freshly shaven , like a newly plowed field . He wore fancy cologne and he carried a perfume box , which he kept raising to his nose as he smiled and talked on . Whenever soldiers walked past , bearing dead bodies , he called them rude hoodlums for bringing a foul , disgusting corpse within breathing distance of him . He interrogated me , with his fancy language , and demanded that I give him my prisoners , to be taken on your behalf . There I was , with the cold aggravating all my wounds , being pestered by this idiot . In my grief and impatience , I gave him some kind of answer . I don’t even remember what I said he could take them , or he couldn’t .
My ladies , good day to you both .
Sweet madam .
I’m glad to see you , your ladyship .
How are you both You are remarkable house keepers . How is your little son
Thank you , your ladyship . He’s fine , good madam .
He’d rather see the soldiers and hear a drum than do his schoolwork .
If the great gods are just , they will help the most honest men .
You should know , noble Pompey , that although the gods may delay action , that doesn’t mean they will necessarily refuse their help .
It’s true , he’s his father’s son . He’s a very good looking boy . I spent half an hour with him on Wednesday . He is so determined . I saw him run after a golden butterfly , and when he caught it , he let it go and then went after it again . He fell down and got back up and again he caught the butterfly . I don’t know whether his fall enraged him or what , but he clenched his teeth and tore it . I tell you , he ripped it apart
But while we pray and wait for that help , the cause we petition for may be lost .
He has his father’s moods .
Indeed , dear , he’s a noble child .
Sometimes we don’t know what’s best for us and ask for things that may harm us . In that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
He’s devilish , madam .
I’ll do well . The people are on my side , and I’m in charge of the sea . My forces are growing , and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together . Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war . Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money . Lepidus flatters both of them , as they flatter him , but he doesn’t love them , and they don’t love him .
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation . They have a massive army .
Where did you hear this It’s not true .
Who’s there
My young master Oh , my gentle master My sweet master Oh , you living memory of old Sir Rowland What are you doing here Why are you so strong and good Why do people love you And why are you noble , strong , and brave Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion Your praise has beaten you home . Don’t you know , master , that some men’s best qualities do them in Yours are like that complete and utter traitors to you . Oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him
Why , what’s the matter
Oh , unlucky boy Don’t walk through these doors . In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you . Oliver , your brother no , not your brother and yet he’s the son but no , I won’t call him the son of that great man I was about to call his father , has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match , and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down , with you in it . And if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you . I overheard him and his plans . This is no place for you this home is now a slaughterhouse . Hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
He’s dreaming . I know they’re in Rome together , hoping for Antony to return . Lecherous Cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips Join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let Antony’s lust combine with both . Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery . Keep his brain drunk and his appetite unsatisfied , so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and forgetful of his duties , like the Lethe does .
What’s the news , Varrius
This news is absolutely true Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now . In the time since he left Egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
I would have listened to less important news with greater enthusiasm . Menas , I had no idea this amorous glutton would have put on his helmet for such an insignificant war . His military ability is double that of the other two . We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow .
But what are you doing away from Wittenberg , Horatio
I felt like skipping school , sir .
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that , and I won’t believe it from you . I know you’d never skip school . What are you doing here in Elsinore I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
Sir , we came to see your father’s funeral .
Well , sir , it’s true it came soon after .
It was all about saving a few bucks , Horatio . The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet . Oh , I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven , Horatio , than have lived through that terrible day My father I think I see my father .
Where , sir
In my imagination , Horatio .
I saw him once . He was an admirable king .
He was a great human being . He was perfect in everything . I’ll never see the likes of him again .
I was so angry , looking at him all shiny and sweet smelling , and speaking like a squeamish woman about guns and battle drums and wounds God almighty and telling me the best thing for an injury is parmaceti , and that it was a shame that the blameless earth had to be dug up to find saltpeter for the gunpowder , when so many good , brave men had been cowardly destroyed by guns , and that if it hadn’t been for those disgusting guns , he would have been a soldier himself . All this trivial , incoherent talk I answered offhandedly , as I’ve already told you . So I beg you please don’t take his word as evidence that there’s anything wrong between you and me , your Majesty .
But he still won’t turn over his prisoners unless he can add these stipulations and exceptions . He wants me , at my own cost , to pay ransom for his brother in law , the foolish Mortimer , a man who , on my life , willfully betrayed his own men , whom he had led in fighting against that great magician , the damned Glendower . And now we hear that Mortimer has married Glendower’s daughter Should the treasury be emptied to ransom a traitor Should I pay for treason , and bargain for a coward , when it was Mortimer who lost himself No . Let him starve in the wilderness . No man who asks me to spend one penny on that traitor Mortimer can ever be a friend of mine .
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion . Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him , as did his brother , though I don’t think Antony instigated it .
Menas , I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones . If it weren’t for the fact that we oppose all three of them together , they’d be fighting each other . They certainly have enough provocation . But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their petty differences , though how that will work out , we cannot say . It will be as the gods see fit . In any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible . Let’s go , Menas .
Set aside your stitching . Pretend to be an idle housewife with me this afternoon .
No , good madam . I can’t go out today .
Can’t go out
She will , she will .
Then where would you have me go , Adam
No . Please let me stay in . I won’t cross the threshold until my husband returns from the war .
It doesn’t matter where , so long as it’s not here .
You’re being unreasonable to confine yourself . Come , you must go visit our neighbor , who’s expecting a baby .
What , would you have me beg for my food Or become a lowlife , sticking up travelers on the road This is all that’s left for me to do , but I won’t do it . I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers .
Why not
But don’t do that . I have five hundred gold coins , which I carefully saved when I was working for your late father . I meant to use it for my retirement , to help me when my old body was lame and forgotten in some dark corner . But take the money , and God , who feeds even the raven and looks after even the sparrow , will comfort me in my old age . Here is the gold , I give it all to you . Let me be your servant . I know I may be old , but I’m strong and healthy , because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly . Therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter cold , but kindly . Let me go with you . I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you .
It’s not because I’m lazy or don’t care for her .
You’re like another Penelope , except they say that all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence only filled Ithaca with moths . I wish your embroidery cloth were as sensitive as your finger , that way you might take pity on it and stop pricking it . Come with us .
No , good madam , please excuse me . I won’t go .
Truly , come with me , and I’ll tell you excellent news about your husband .
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet . Armorers are doing great business , and all men think about is honor . People are selling off their land to buy warhorses so they can follow the exemplary king into battle as if they had winged feet , like Mercury . There’s a sense of anticipation in the air . In the minds of Harry and his followers , visions of the kingdoms , spoils , and titles to be won eclipse thoughts of actual fighting . The French , meanwhile , have been forewarned of all this preparation by their spies and tremble in fear . They seek to derail the English with cowardly tricks . Oh , England You are physically small but inwardly great , like a mighty heart enclosed in a small body . There is nothing you couldn’t accomplish if all your subjects were loyal and loving But , see , the king of France has detected your weak spot a nest of faithless traitors , whose treachery he has purchased with gold . Three corrupt men Richard , earl of Cambridge Henry , Lord Scroop of Masham and Sir Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland have agreed to conspire with the French in exchange for money . The gracious king will die by their hands in Southampton before he sets sail for France if Hell and treason have their way . Stick with us , ladies and gentlemen , and we’ll make a play , conquering space and time . Imagine that the traitors have been paid and made their choice . The king has left London , and the scene now
Oh , good madam , there can’t be good news yet .
What , are you mocking me to my face You think I’m joking Here . Take that , and that
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me , you try to take advantage of my affection . You pull pranks when I’m in a serious mood . You know , foolish gnats come out in the sunshine , but they creep back into their holes when it’s dark . If you want to crack jokes , first check what kind of mood I’m in and then adjust your behavior to suit me . If you don’t learn this rule , I’ll have to beat it into your sconce .
You call it my sconce I’d rather call it my head so you’d stop battering it . If you keep pounding me , I’ll need a sconce to wrap my head with , or else I’ll have to keep my brain in my chest . But sir , why are you beating me
Don’t you know
Good Enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
All I know is that I’m being beaten .
Should I tell you why
I will advise him to speak as he usually does . If Caesar makes him mad , let Antony stand tall and speak as loudly as Mars , the god of war . By Jupiter , if I were Antony , I wouldn’t shave my beard today . I’d leave it long and dare Caesar to insult me by pulling on it , just so I could fight him .
Yes , and wherefore . You know the old saying Every ‘why’ has a ‘wherefore . ’
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
It’s always appropriate to deal with matters as they arise .
But major issues must come before minor ones .
Not if the minor ones come up first .
You speak out of passion , but I beg you not to stir things up . Here comes the noble Antony .
And there comes Caesar .
If we can come to an agreement here , we’ll move on to Parthia . Listen , Ventidius .
Oh , good old man , you’re a great example of that old work ethic , where people worked because it was their duty , not just for the money . Your approach isn’t the fashion these days , when no one works hard except for a promotion , and , as soon as they’ve got it , they stop working . But in working for me , old man , you are pruning a rotten tree despite all your pains and efforts , it won’t yield a single blossom . Come along , though . We’ll go together , and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth , we’ll find a way to make a living .
Sir , I think I saw him last night .
Saw who
Go on , master , and I will follow you with truth and loyalty to my last breath . From the time I was seventeen , over sixty years ago , I have lived in this house , but now I will live here no more . Many men seek their fortune at seventeen at eighty , it’s a bit late . But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
Your father , sir . The dead king .
The king my father
Don’t get too excited yet , sir . Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
For God’s sake , let me hear it .
After midnight , for two nights running , these two guards , Marcellus and Barnardo , saw a figure that looked very much like your father , in full armor from head to toe . It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times , a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes , while they turned , quaking with fear and too shocked to speak . They told me all about this , so on the third night I agreed to come stand guard with them , to see for myself . It happened again , just as they had described . I knew your father . This ghost looked as much like him as my two hands are like each other .
That traitor Mortimer He never faltered , my lord , except through an accident of war . I’ll prove it , by speaking about the many wounds he heroically suffered when he spent an hour in brutal hand to hand combat against Glendower on the grassy banks of the Severn River . They broke three times from fighting , and they drank three times from the Severn . The river itself was frightened by their horrible looks . Its water became discolored with the blood of these brave fighters , and the Severn ran off , as if to hide itself in the weeds on its banks . Treachery has never used deadly wounds to cover its operations , and Mortimer could never have willingly suffered so many injuries . Do not let him be slandered by calling him a traitor .
You speak wrongly about him , Percy , you speak wrongly He never fought Glendower . I tell you , he would just as soon dare to meet the devil himself as fight Glendower . Aren’t you ashamed of yourself Don’t ever let me hear you speak of Mortimer again . Send me your prisoners as quickly as possible , or you’ll hear about it from me , and you won’t like what I have to say . Northumberland , I give you and your son permission to leave now .
Good friends , the cause that joined us was noble . Don’t let some petty quarrel tear us apart . Let’s discuss this calmly . When we argue our differences with raised voices , we do more harm than good . So I plead with you to use reasonable words as you discuss these unreasonable deeds , and don’t lose your tempers .
You’re right . If we were in front of our armies , about to fight , I would do this .
Welcome to Rome .
Thank you .
Have a seat .
After you .
Otherwise , it becomes a meaningless exercise papers and numbers , and names of men rather than real , live men . That’s like drawing up plans for a house you can’t possibly afford , building half of it , and then abandoning the partly built structure to be ruined by the elements .
No , after you .
I hear you’ve interpreted some of my actions as being improper , when they weren’t improper at all or if they were , their impropriety didn’t concern you .
Why Does the King only have twenty five thousand men
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully , when I had no reason to speak of you at all .
The King isn’t facing us with any more than that in fact , he doesn’t even have that many , Lord Bardolph . This is a time of war , and the King’s had to divide his army into three sections . One division is fighting the French one’s fighting Glendower . That leaves a third of his army to fight against us . The King is weak and divided into three , and the coffers of his treasury echo with the sounds of hollow poverty and emptiness .
There’s no reason to fear that he will pull all three divisions together and confront us with his full strength .
If he did that , he’d be vulnerable at the rear , and the French and the Welsh would be at his heels . He would never let that happen .
Who’s going to lead his troops against us
Really , madam
Yes , it’s true . I heard a senator talking . He said Cominius the general is leading one part of our Roman army against the oncoming Volsces . Your husband and Titus Lartius are attacking their city Corioles . They have no doubt that they’ll win and that the battle won’t last long . On my honor , this news is true . Please come out with us .
Forgive me , good madam . I’ll do as you say from now on .
Let her stay home , lady . The way she is now , she’ll only detract from our celebration .
I think you’re right she will . Cheer up then , good sweet lady . Please , Virgilia , shake off your sad mood and come out with us .
No . In a word , madam , I simply can’t . I wish you much happiness .
Well then , goodbye .
Oh Lord , my spirits are tired
I wouldn’t care about my spirits , if my legs weren’t tired .
I’d insult my manly wardrobe by weeping like a woman if I didn’t have to comfort the weaker vessel here , as the jacket and hose ought to be brave for the sake of the petticoat . So , have courage , good Aliena .
Please bear with me . I can’t go any further .
I’d rather bear with you than bear you . But if I did carry you , it would be no cross to bear , because I’m pretty sure you don’t have any money .
Yes , now I’m in Arden , and that makes me the bigger fool . When I was at home , I was in a better place . But travelers have to be content .
Look who’s coming a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
How do you mean , conspired
You can judge for yourself what I mean . Your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name . They said they were acting for you .
You’re mistaken . My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion . I talked to some reliable participants in that battle . On the contrary , his fight was with both of us . He rejected my authority as much as yours . Since you and I share a common cause , wouldn’t his actions against you be hostile to me as well I’ve already sent the proof in my letters . If you want to pick a fight , you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse .
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you’re just making up feeble excuses .
On the platform where we stand guard , sir .
Didn’t you talk to it
I did , sir , but it didn’t answer me . It raised its head once as if it was about to speak , but just then the rooster started crowing , and the ghost vanished from sight .
Send your prisoners , or you’ll hear about it .
Even if the devil himself comes screaming for them , I won’t send those prisoners . I’m going to go after him and tell him so it will ease my heart , though it might cost me my head .
What , drunk with anger Wait a minute . Here comes your uncle .
Talk about Mortimer God damn , I will talk about him . And damn my soul if I don’t join him I’ll empty out my veins for him , and I’ll pour my precious blood onto the ground , drop by drop And I’ll lift this put upon Mortimer as high up as this ungrateful King , this ungenerous , rotten Bolingbroke
Brother , the King’s driven your nephew crazy .
Who started this trouble after I left
He wants all my prisoners , for God’s sake And when I asked again for him to ransom my brother in law , he looked pale , and he shot me a look that could kill . Just the mention of Mortimer’s name makes him shake .
Not true , not true . You know I would never approve a war against my own cause . As for my wife , if only you had such a wife . It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
I had no control over her uprisings , Caesar , which arose from her impatience and were shrewdly undertaken , as well . I’m sorry she caused you so much trouble . But you can’t blame me for her offenses .
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria . You put my letters in your pocket without reading them and then mocked my messenger out of the room .
