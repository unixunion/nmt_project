Before we proceed any further , hear me speak .
Speak , speak .
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish
Resolved . resolved .
First , you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people .
We know’t , we know’t .
Let us kill him , and we’ll have corn at our own price . Is’t a verdict
No more talking on’t let it be done away , away
Nay , but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure . Those his goodly eyes , That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars , now bend , now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front . His captain’s heart , Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast , reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust .
Look where they come . Take but good note , and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet’s fool . Behold and see .
Proceed , Solinus , to procure my fall , And by the doom of death end woes and all .
Merchant of Syracuse , plead no more . I am not partial to infringe our laws . The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke To merchants , our well dealing countrymen , Who , wanting guilders to redeem their lives , Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods , Excludes all pity from our threatening looks . For , since the mortal and intestine jars Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves , To admit no traffic to our adverse towns . Nay , more , if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs Again , if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus , he dies , His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose , Unless a thousand marks be levièd To quit the penalty and to ransom him . Thy substance , valued at the highest rate , Cannot amount unto a hundred marks Therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
Yet this my comfort when your words are done , My woes end likewise with the evening sun .
If it be love indeed , tell me how much .
Oh , for a muse of fire that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention A kingdom for a stage , princes to act , And monarchs to behold the swelling scene Then should the warlike Harry , like himself , Assume the port of Mars , and at his heels , Leashed in like hounds , should famine , sword , and fire Crouch for employment . But pardon , gentles all , The flat unraisèd spirits that hath dared On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object . Can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of France Or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt O pardon , since a crookèd figure may Attest in little place a million , And let us , ciphers to this great account , On your imaginary forces work . Suppose within the girdle of these walls Are now confined two mighty monarchies Whose high uprearèd and abutting fronts The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder . Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts . Into a thousand parts divide one man , And make imaginary puissance . Think , when we talk of horses , that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i th receiving earth , For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings , Carry them here and there , jumping o er times ,
As I remember , Adam , it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns , and , as thou sayest , charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well . And there begins my sadness . My brother Jaques he keeps at school , and report speaks goldenly of his profit . For my part , he keeps me rustically at home or , to speak more properly , stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better , for , besides that they are fair with their feeding , they are taught their manage and , to that end , riders dearly hired . But I , his brother , gain nothing under him but growth , for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I . Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me , the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me . He lets me feed with his hinds , bars me the place of a brother , and , as much as in him lies , mines my gentility with my education . This is it , Adam , that grieves me , and the spirit of my father , which I think is within me , begins to mutiny against this servitude . I will no longer endure it , though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it .
Yonder comes my master , your brother .
Go apart , Adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
Who keeps the gate here , ho
What shall I say you are
His lordship is walked forth into the orchard . Please it your Honor knock but at the gate And he himself will answer .
Here comes the Earl .
What news , Lord Bardolph Every minute now Should be the father of some stratagem . The times are wild . Contention , like a horse Full of high feeding , madly hath broke loose And bears down all before him .
So shaken as we are , so wan with care , Find we a time for frighted peace to pant And breathe short winded accents of new broils To be commenced in strands afar remote . No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood . Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields , Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces . Those opposèd eyes , Which , like the meteors of a troubled heaven , All of one nature , of one substance bred , Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery Shall now , in mutual well beseeming ranks , March all one way and be no more opposed Against acquaintance , kindred , and allies . The edge of war , like an ill sheathèd knife , No more shall cut his master . Therefore , friends , As far as to the sepulcher of Christ Whose soldier now , under whose blessed cross We are impressèd and engaged to fight Forthwith a power of English shall we levy , Whose arms were molded in their mothers womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walked those blessèd feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed For our advantage on the bitter cross .
We are accounted poor citizens , the patricians good . What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity , while it were wholesome , we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us , the object of our misery , is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them . Let us revenge this with our pikes , ere we become rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread , not in thirst for revenge .
Who’s there
There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned .
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
Then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
News , my good lord , from Rome .
Grates me , the sum .
Turning th accomplishment of many years Into an hour glass for the which supply , Admit me chorus to this history Who , prologue like , your humble patience pray Gently to hear , kindly to judge our play .
Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius
Nay , answer me . Stand and unfold yourself .
Long live the king
Barnardo
He .
You come most carefully upon your hour .
Tis now struck twelve . Get thee to bed , Francisco .
Have you had quiet guard
Well , Syracusian , say in brief the cause Why thou dep artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus .
Nay , hear them , Antony . Fulvia perchance is angry . Or who knows If the scarce bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you , Do this , or this . Take in that kingdom , and enfranchise that . Perform ’t , or else we damn thee .
How , my love
Perchance Nay , and most like . You must not stay here longer . Your dismission Is come from Caesar . Therefore hear it , Antony . Where’s Fulvia’s process Caesar’s , I would say both Call in the messengers . As I am Egypt’s queen , Thou blushest , Antony , and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager . Else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill tongued Fulvia scolds . The messengers
A heavier task could not have been imposed Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable Yet , that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature , not by vile offense , I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave . In Syracusa was I born , and wed Unto a woman happy but for me , And by me , had not our hap been bad . With her I lived in joy . Our wealth increased By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum , till my factor’s death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself–almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear– Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrivèd where I was . There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons , And , which was strange , the one so like the other As could not be distinguished but by names . That very hour , and in the selfsame inn , A meaner woman was deliverèd Of such a burden , male twins , both alike . Those , for their parents were exceeding poor , I bought and brought up to attend my sons . My wife , not meanly proud of two such boys , Made daily motions for our home return . Unwilling , I agreed . Alas , too soon We came aboard .
Not a mouse stirring .
Well , good night . If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , The rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
I think I hear them . Stand , ho Who’s there
Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall . Here is my space . Kingdoms are clay . Our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man . The nobleness of life Is to do thus , when such a mutual pair And such a twain can do ’t , in which I bind , On pain of punishment , the world to weet We stand up peerless .
Now , sir , what make you here
Nothing . I am not taught to make anything .
What mar you then , sir
Marry , sir , I am helping you to mar that which God made , a poor unworthy brother of yours , with idleness .
Marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
Know you where you are , sir
O sir , very well here in your orchard .
But this our purpose now is twelve month old , And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go . Therefor we meet not now . Then let me hear Of you , my gentle cousin Westmoreland , What yesternight our council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience .
Know you before whom , sir
Ay , better than him I am before knows me . I know you are my eldest brother , and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me . The courtesy of nations allows you my better , in that you are the first born , but the same tradition takes not away my blood , were there twenty brothers betwixt us . I have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , I confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
My liege , this haste was hot in question , And many limits of the charge set down But yesternight when all athwart there came A post from Wales loaden with heavy news , Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer , Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight Against the irregular and wild Glendower , Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken , A thousand of his people butcherèd , Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse , Such beastly shameless transformation By those Welshwomen done , as may not be Without much shame retold or spoken of .
It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land .
Excellent falsehood Why did he marry Fulvia , and not love her I’ll seem the fool I am not . Antony Will be himself .
But stirred by Cleopatra . Now , for the love of Love and her soft hours , Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh . There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now . What sport tonight
Come , come , elder brother , you are too young in this .
Wilt thou lay hands on me , villain
I am no villain . I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys . He was my father , and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains . Wert thou not my brother , I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so . Thou hast railed on thyself .
My lord , I’ll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like , and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question .
Let me go , I say .
But how , my lord , shall we resist it now
I will not till I please . You shall hear me . My father charged you in his will to give me good education . You have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities . The spirit of my father grows strong in me , and I will no longer endure it . Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman , or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament . With that I will go buy my fortunes .
And what wilt thou do beg when that is spent Well , sir , get you in . I will not long be troubled with you . You shall have some part of your will . I pray you leave me .
It must be thought on . If it pass against us , We lose the better half of our possession , For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us , being valued thus As much as would maintain , to the King’s honor , Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , Six thousand and two hundred good esquires And , to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil , A hundred almshouses right well supplied And to the coffers of the King besides , A thousand pounds by th year . Thus runs the bill .
This would drink deep .
Noble Earl , I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury .
Good , an God will
As good as heart can wish . The King is almost wounded to the death , And , in the fortune of my lord your son , Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts Killed by the hand of Douglas young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field And Harry Monmouth’s brawn , the hulk Sir John , Is prisoner to your son . O , such a day , So fought , so followed , and so fairly won , Came not till now to dignify the times Since Caesar’s fortunes .
How is this derived Saw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury
I spake with one , my lord , that came from thence , A gentleman well bred and of good name , That freely rendered me these news for true .
Here comes my servant Travers , who I sent On Tuesday last to listen after news .
My lord , I overrode him on the way And he is furnished with no certainties More than he haply may retail from me .
Now , Travers , what good tidings comes with you
Against him first he’s a very dog to the commonalty .
Consider you what services he has done for his country
Very well and could be content to give him good report fort , but that he pays himself with being proud .
Nay , but speak not maliciously .
I say unto you , what he hath done famously , he did it to that end though soft conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is , even till the altitude of his virtue .
What he cannot help in his nature , you account a vice in him . You must in no way say he is covetous .
What shouts are these The other side o’ the city is risen why stay we prating here to the Capitol
Come , come .
Soft who comes here
Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always loved the people .
He’s one honest enough would all the rest were so
A league from Epidamnum had we sailed Before the always wind obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm But longer did we not retain much hope For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death , Which though myself would gladly have embraced , Yet the incessant weepings of my wife , Weeping before for what she saw must come , And piteous plainings of the pretty babes , That mourned for fashion , ignorant what to fear , Forced me to seek delays for them and me . And this it was , for other means was none The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship , then sinking ripe , to us . My wife , more careful for the latter born , Had fastened him unto a small spare mast , Such as seafaring men provide for storms . To him one of the other twins was bound , Whilst I had been like heedful of the other . The children thus disposed , my wife and I , Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed , Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And , floating straight , obedient to the stream , Was carried towards Corinth , as we thought . At length the sun , gazing upon the earth , Dispersed those vapors that offended us , And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxed calm , and we discoverèd Two ships from far , making amain to us , Of Corinth that , of Epidaurus this . But ere they came , –O , let me say no more Gather the sequel by that went before .
Hear the ambassadors .
Fie , wrangling Queen Whom every thing becomes to chide , to laugh , To weep , whose every passion fully strives To make itself , in thee , fair and admired No messenger but thine , and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people . Come , my Queen , Last night you did desire it . Speak not to us .
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight
Sir , sometimes when he is not Antony He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony .
My lord , Sir John Umfrevile turned me back With joyful tidings and , being better horsed , Outrode me . After him came spurring hard A gentleman , almost forspent with speed , That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse . He asked the way to Chester , and of him I did demand what news from Shrewsbury . He told me that rebellion had bad luck And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold . With that he gave his able horse the head And , bending forward , struck his armèd heels Against the panting sides of his poor jade Up to the rowel head , and starting so He seemed in running to devour the way , Staying no longer question .
Ha Again Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold Of Hotspur , Coldspur That rebellion Had met ill luck
Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss
Here is a dear , a true industrious friend , Sir Walter Blunt , new lighted from his horse . Stained with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours , And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news . The Earl of Douglas is discomfited Ten thousand bold Scots , two and twenty knights , Balked in their own blood , did Sir Walter see On Holmedon’s plains . Of prisoners Hotspur took Mordake , Earl of Fife , and eldest son To beaten Douglas , and the Earl of Atholl , Of Murray , Angus , and Menteith . And is not this an honorable spoil A gallant prize Ha , cousin , is it not
In faith , it is a conquest for a prince to boast of .
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good .
Get you with him , you old dog .
Is old dog my reward Most true , I have lost my teeth in your service . God be with my old master . He would not have spoke such a word .
Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither . Holla , Dennis
Was not Charles , the duke’s wrestler , here to speak with me
So please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
Call him in .
Twill be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .
I am full sorry That he approves the common liar , who Thus speaks of him at Rome , but I will hope Of better deeds tomorrow . Rest you happy
Good morrow to your Worship .
Good Monsieur Charles , what’s the new news at the new court
Yea , this man’s brow , like to a title leaf , Foretells the nature of a tragic volume . So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness’d usurpation . Say , Morton , didst thou come from Shrewsbury
There’s no news at the court , sir , but the old news . That is , the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke , and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him , whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke . Therefore he gives them good leave to wander .
I ran from Shrewsbury , my noble lord , Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our party .
Can you tell if Rosalind , the duke’s daughter , be banished with her father
Twould drink the cup and all .
Where will the old duke live
But what prevention
Douglas is living , and your brother yet , But for my lord your son
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden , and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England . They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly , as they did in the golden world .
The king is full of grace and fair regard .
Why , he is dead . See what a ready tongue suspicion hath He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath , by instinct , knowledge from others eyes That what he feared is chancèd . Yet speak , Morton . Tell thou an earl his divination lies ,
And a true lover of the holy Church .
Friends to this ground .
And liegemen to the Dane .
Give you good night .
O , farewell , honest soldier . Who hath relieved you
Holla , Barnardo .
Say what , is Horatio there
Welcome , Horatio . Welcome , good Marcellus .
What , has this thing appeared again tonight
I have seen nothing .
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us . Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night , That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it .
Marry , do I , sir , and I came to acquaint you with a matter . I am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall . Tomorrow , sir , I wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well . Your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love I would be loath to foil him , as I must for my own honor if he come in . Therefore , out of my love to you , I came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
Charles , I thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite . I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it but he is resolute . I’ll tell thee , Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man’s good parts , a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother . Therefore use thy discretion . I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger . And thou wert best look to ’t , for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee , he will practice against thee by poison , entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta en thy life by some indirect means or other . For I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living . I speak but brotherly of him , but should I anatomize him to thee as he is , I must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrong .
You are too great to be by me gainsaid , Your spirit is too true , your fears too certain .
Yet , for all this , say not that Percy’s dead . I see a strange confession in thine eye . Thou shak’st thy head and hold’st it fear or sin To speak a truth . If he be slain , say so . The tongue offends not that reports his death And he doth sin that doth belie the dead , Not he which says the dead is not alive . Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office , and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell Remembered tolling a departing friend .
I cannot think , my lord , your son is dead .
I am sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen , But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state , Rend ring faint quittance , wearied and outbreathed , To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down The never daunted Percy to the earth , From whence with life he never more sprung up . In few , his death , whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp , Being bruited once , took fire and heat away From the best tempered courage in his troops For from his metal was his party steeled , Which , once in him abated , all the rest Turned on themselves , like dull and heavy lead . And as the thing that’s heavy in itself Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed ,
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost most absolute Alexas , where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen Oh that I knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands
Your will
Is ’t you , sir , that know things
In nature’s infinite book of secrecy A little I can read .
Show him your hand .
Bring in the banquet quickly . Wine enough Cleopatra’s health to drink .
I make not , but foresee .
Pray , then , foresee me one .
You shall be yet far fairer than you are .
He means in flesh .
No , you shall paint when you are old .
This is his uncle’s teaching . This is Worcester , Malevolent to you in all aspects , Which makes him prune himself , and bristle up The crest of youth against your dignity .
Wrinkles forbid
Vex not his prescience . Be attentive .
Hush
You shall be more beloving than beloved .
I am heartily glad I came hither to you . If he come tomorrow , I’ll give him his payment . If ever he go alone again , I’ll never wrestle for prize more . And so God keep your Worship .
Farewell , good Charles .
Now will I stir this gamester . I hope I shall see an end of him , for my soul yet I know not why hates nothing more than he . Yet he’s gentle , never schooled and yet learned , full of noble device , of all sorts enchantingly beloved , and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people , who best know him , that I am altogether misprized . But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all . Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither , which now I’ll go about .
Nay , forward , old man . Do not break off so , For we may pity though not pardon thee .
O , had the gods done so , I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us . For , ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues , We were encounterd by a mighty rock , Which being violently borne upon , Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst So that , in this unjust divorce of us , Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in , what to sorrow for . Her part , poor soul , seeming as burdenèd With lesser weight , but not with lesser woe , Was carried with more speed before the wind , And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth , as we thought . At length , another ship had seized on us And , knowing whom it was their hap to save , Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests , And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail And therefore homeward did they bend their course . Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall n of them and thee till now .
What work’s , my countrymen , in hand where go you With bats and clubs The matter speak , I pray you .
Our business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do , which now we’ll show ’em in deeds . They say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too .
Why , masters , my good friends , mine honest neighbours , Will you undo yourselves
We cannot , sir , we are undone already .
I tell you , friends , most charitable care Have the patricians of you . For your wants , Your suffering in this dearth , you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state , whose course will on The way it takes , cracking ten thousand curbs Of more strong link asunder than can ever Appear in your impediment . For the dearth , The gods , not the patricians , make it , and Your knees to them , not arms , must help . Alack , You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you , and you slander The helms o’ the state , who care for you like fathers , When you curse them as enemies .
So did our men , heavy in Hotspur’s loss , Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim Than did our soldiers , aiming at their safety , Fly from the field . Then was the noble Worcester Too soon ta en prisoner and that furious Scot , The bloody Douglas , whose well laboring sword Had three times slain th appearance of the King , Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame Of those that turned their backs and in his flight , Stumbling in fear , was took . The sum of all Is that the King hath won and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you , my lord , Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland . This is the news at full .
For this I shall have time enough to mourn . In poison there is physic , and these news , Having been well , that would have made me sick , Being sick , have in some measure made me well . And as the wretch whose fever weakened joints , Like strengthless hinges , buckle under life , Impatient of his fit , breaks like a fire Out of his keeper’s arms , even so my limbs , Weakened with grief , being now enraged with grief , Are thrice themselves . Hence therefore , thou nice crutch . A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand . And hence , thou sickly coif . Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes , fleshed with conquest , aim to hit . Now bind my brows with iron , and approach The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon th enraged Northumberland . Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Nature’s hand Keep the wild flood confined . Let order die , And let this world no longer be a stage
Dear Celia , I show more mirth than I am mistress of , and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
Well , I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
You know my father hath no child but I , nor none is like to have , and , truly , when he dies , thou shalt be his heir , for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce , I will render thee again in affection . By mine honor I will , and when I break that oath , let me turn monster . Therefore , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be merry .
From henceforth I will , coz , and devise sports . Let me see what think you of falling in love
Marry , I prithee do , to make sport withal , but love no man in good earnest , nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honor come off again .
The courses of his youth promised it not . The breath no sooner left his father’s body But that his wildness , mortified in him , Seemed to die too . Yea , at that very moment Consideration like an angel came And whipped th offending Adam out of him , Leaving his body as a paradise T envelop and contain celestial spirits . Never was such a sudden scholar made , Never came reformation in a flood With such a heady currance scouring faults , Nor never Hydra headed willfulness So soon did lose his seat , and all at once , As in this king .
We are blessèd in the change .
Hear him but reason in divinity And , all admiring , with an inward wish , You would desire the King were made a prelate . Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs , You would say it hath been all in all his study . List his discourse of war , and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music . Turn him to any cause of policy , The Gordian knot of it he will unloose Familiar as his garter that , when he speaks , The air , a chartered libertine , is still , And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences So that the art and practic part of life Must be the mistress to this theoric Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it , Since his addiction was to courses vain , His companies unlettered , rude , and shallow , His hours filled up with riots , banquets , sports , And never noted in him any study , Any retirement , any sequestration From open haunts and popularity .
But I have sent for him to answer this . And for this cause awhile we must neglect Our holy purpose to Jerusalem . Cousin , on Wednesday next our council we Will hold at Windsor . So inform the lords . But come yourself with speed to us again , For more is to be said and to be done Than out of anger can be utterèd .
I will , my liege .
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears , That are so fortified against our story , What we have two nights seen .
Well , sit we down , And let us hear Barnardo speak of this .
Last night of all , When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course t illume that part of heaven Where now it burns , Marcellus and myself , The bell then beating one
Peace , break thee off . Look where it comes again
In the same figure like the king that’s dead .
Thou art a scholar . Speak to it , Horatio .
Looks it not like the king Mark it , Horatio .
It would be spoke to .
Question it , Horatio .
What art thou that usurp’st this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march By heaven , I charge thee , speak .
What shall be our sport , then
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
I would we could do so , for her benefits are mightily misplaced , and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women .
Tis true , for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest , and those that she makes honest she makes very ill favoredly .
This strainèd passion doth you wrong , my lord .
Nay , now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s . Fortune reigns in gifts of the world , not in the lineaments of Nature .
No When Nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune , hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
Indeed , there is Fortune too hard for Nature , when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter off of Nature’s wit .
We all that are engagèd to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life , ’twas ten to one And yet we ventured , for the gain proposed Choked the respect of likely peril feared
I had rather heat my liver with drinking .
Nay , hear him .
Good now , some excellent fortune Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all . Let me have a child at fifty , to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage . Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar , and companion me with my mistress .
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve .
Oh , excellent I love long life better than figs .
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach .
Then belike my children shall have no names . Prithee , how many boys and wenches must I have
If every of your wishes had a womb , And fertile every wish , a million .
Out , fool I forgive thee for a witch .
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
Nay , come , tell Iras hers .
We’ll know all our fortunes .
Mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be drunk to bed .
There’s a palm presages chastity , if nothing else .
Reft of his brother , but retained his name– Might bear him company in the quest of him , Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see , I hazarded the loss of whom I loved . Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece , Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia , And , coasting homeward , came to Ephesus , Hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men . But here must end the story of my life And happy were I in my timely death Could all my travels warrant me they live .
Were you made the messenger
Hapless Egeon , whom the fates have marked To bear the extremity of dire mishap , Now , trust me , were it not against our laws , Against my crown , my oath , my dignity , Which princes , would they , may not disannul , My soul would sue as advocate for thee . But though thou art adjudgèd to the death , And passèd sentence may not be recalled But to our honour’s great disparagement , Yet will I favor thee in what I can . Therefore , merchant , I’ll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help . Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus Beg thou , or borrow , to make up the sum , And live . If no , then thou art doom’d to die . – Jailer , take him to thy custody .
No , by mine honor , but I was bid to come for you .
I will , my lord .
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes , and swore by his honor the mustard was naught . Now , I’ll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
Ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
And since we are o erset , venture again . Come , we will all put forth , body and goods .
Care for us True , indeed They ne’er cared for us yet suffer us to famish , and their store houses crammed with grain make edicts for usury , to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich , and provide more piercing statutes daily , to chain up and restrain the poor . If the wars eat us not up , they will and there’s all the love they bear us .
Tis more than time . And , my most noble lord , I hear for certain , and do speak the truth The gentle Archbishop of York is up With well appointed powers . He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers . My lord your son had only but the corpse , But shadows and the shows of men , to fight For that same word rebellion did divide The action of their bodies from their souls , And they did fight with queasiness , constrained , As men drink potions , that their weapons only Seemed on our side . But , for their spirits and souls , This word rebellion , it had froze them up As fish are in a pond . But now the Bishop Turns insurrection to religion . Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts , He’s followed both with body and with mind , And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard , scraped from Pomfret stones Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land , Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke And more and less do flock to follow him .
Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious , Or be accused of folly . I shall tell you A pretty tale it may be you have heard it But , since it serves my purpose , I will venture To stale ’t a little more .
I knew of this before , but , to speak truth , This present grief had wiped it from my mind . Go in with me and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge . Get posts and letters , and make friends with speed . Never so few , and never yet more need .
Well , I’ll hear it , sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but , an ’t please you , deliver .
There was a time when all the body’s members Rebell’d against the belly , thus accused it That only like a gulf it did remain I’ the midst o’ the body , idle and unactive , Still cupboarding the viand , never bearing Like labour with the rest , where the other instruments Did see and hear , devise , instruct , walk , feel , And , mutually participate , did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body . The belly answer’d
Prithee , who is ’t that thou mean’st
One that old Frederick , your father , loves .
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
By my troth , thou sayest true . For , since the little wit that fools have was silenced , the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show . Here comes Monsieur Le Beau .
With his mouth full of news .
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
Then shall we be news crammed .
All the better . We shall be the more marketable . Bonjour , Monsieur Le Beau . What’s the news
Fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
Sport Of what color
Now , Hal , what time of day is it , lad
Indeed , you come near me now , Hal , for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars , and not by Phoebus , he , that wand ring knight so fair . And I prithee , sweet wag , when thou art king , as God save thy Grace Majesty , I should say , for grace thou wilt have none
What , none
No , by my troth , not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter .
Well , how then Come , roundly , roundly .
Marry , then , sweet wag , when thou art king , let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty . Let us be Diana’s foresters , gentlemen of the shade , minions of the moon , and let men say we be men of good government , being governed , as the sea is , by our noble and chaste mistress the moon , under whose countenance we steal .
Sirrah , you giant , what says the doctor to my water
He said , sir , the water itself was a good healthy water , but , for the party that owed it , he might have more diseases than he knew for .
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me . The brain of this foolish compounded clay , man , is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than I invent , or is invented on me . I am not only witty in myself , but the cause that wit is in other men . I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one . If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off , why then I have no judgment . Thou whoreson mandrake , thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels . I was never manned with an agate till now , but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver , but in vile apparel , and send you back again to your master for a jewel . The juvenal , the Prince your master , whose chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek , and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal . God may finish it when He will . Tis not a hair amiss yet . He may keep it still at a face royal , for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it , and yet he’ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor . He may keep his own grace , but he’s almost out of
Well , sir , what answer made the belly
Sir , I shall tell you . With a kind of smile , Which ne’er came from the lungs , but even thus For , look you , I may make the belly smile As well as speak it tauntingly replied To the discontented members , the mutinous parts That envied his receipt even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as you .
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain’d , Who is the sink o’ the body ,
Well , what then
The former agents , if they did complain , What could the belly answer
I will tell you If you’ll bestow a small of what you have little Patience awhile , you’ll hear the belly’s answer .
Go , you wild bedfellow , you cannot soothsay .
Nay , if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication , I cannot scratch mine ear . Prithee , tell her but a workaday fortune .
Your fortunes are alike .
I have said .
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she
Well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than I , where would you choose it
What color , madam How shall I answer you
Our worser thoughts heavens mend . Alexas Come , his fortune , his fortune Oh , let him marry a woman that cannot go , sweet Isis , I beseech thee , and let her die too , and give him a worse , and let worse follow worse , till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave , fifty fold a cuckold Good Isis , hear me this prayer , though thou deny me a matter of more weight , good Isis , I beseech thee
As wit and fortune will .
Amen , dear goddess , hear that prayer of the people For , as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose wived , so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded . Therefore , dear Isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .
Or as the Destinies decrees .
Well said . That was laid on with a trowel .
Nay , if I keep not my rank
Thou losest thy old smell .
You amaze me , ladies . I would have told you of good wrestling , which you have lost the sight of .
You tell us the manner of the wrestling .
I will tell you the beginning , and if it please your Ladyships , you may see the end , for the best is yet to do , and here , where you are , they are coming to perform it .
Well , the beginning that is dead and buried .
There comes an old man and his three sons
I could match this beginning with an old tale .
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence .
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle , And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best Neighbored by fruit of baser quality And so the Prince obscured his contemplation Under the veil of wildness , which , no doubt , Grew like the summer grass , fastest by night , Unseen yet crescive in his faculty .
Ye’re long about it .
It must be so , for miracles are ceased , And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected .
Note me this , good friend Your most grave belly was deliberate , Not rash like his accusers , and thus answer’d ‘True is it , my incorporate friends , ’ quoth he , ‘That I receive the general food at first , Which you do live upon and fit it is , Because I am the store house and the shop Of the whole body but , if you do remember , I send it through the rivers of your blood , Even to the court , the heart , to the seat o’ the brain And , through the cranks and offices of man , The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live and though that all at once , You , my good friends , ’ this says the belly , mark me ,
Ay , sir well , well .
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum , Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate . This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here And , not being able to buy out his life , According to the statute of the town Dies ere the weary sun set in the west . There is your money that I had to keep .
He seems indifferent , Or rather swaying more upon our part Than cherishing th exhibitors against us For I have made an offer to his Majesty Upon our spiritual convocation And in regard of causes now in hand , Which I have opened to his Grace at large , As touching France to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal .
Go bear it to the Centaur , where we host , And stay there , Dromio , till I come to thee . Within this hour it will be dinnertime . Till that , I’ll view the manners of the town , Peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , And then return and sleep within mine inn , For with long travel I am stiff and weary . Get thee away .
It was an answer how apply you this
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed , having so good a mean .
mine , I can assure him . What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops
A trusty villain , sir , that very oft , When I am dull with care and melancholy , Lightens my humor with his merry jests . What , will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me
He said , sir , you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph . He would not take his band and yours . He liked not the security .
I am invited , sir , to certain merchants , Of whom I hope to make much benefit .
Let him be damned like the glutton Pray God his tongue be hotter A whoreson Achitophel , a rascally yea forsooth knave , to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The whoreson smoothy pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up , then they must stand upon security . I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security . I looked he should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin , as I am a true knight , and he sends me security . Well , he may sleep in security , for he hath the horn of abundance , and the lightness of his wife shines through it , and yet cannot he see though he have his own lantern to light him . Where’s Bardolph
He’s gone into Smithfield to buy your Worship a horse .
I bought him in Paul’s , and he’ll buy me a horse in Smithfield . An I could get me but a wife in the stews , I were manned , horsed , and wived .
With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men by these presents .
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles , the duke’s wrestler , which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him . So he served the second , and so the third . Yonder they lie , the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
Alas
But what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost
Why , this that I speak of .
Thus men may grow wiser every day . It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies .
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking Shall we see this wrestling , cousin
It is offended .
See , it stalks away .
Stay Speak , speak I charge thee , speak
Tis gone and will not answer .
How now , Horatio You tremble and look pale . Is not this something more than fantasy What think you on ’t
Is it not like the king
As thou art to thyself . Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated . So frowned he once when , in an angry parle , He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice . Tis strange .
Thus twice before , and jump at this dead hour , With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch .
In what particular thought to work I know not , But in the gross and scope of mine opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state .
Thou sayest well , and it holds well too , for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea , being governed , as the sea is , by the moon . As for proof now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning , got with swearing Lay by and spent with crying Bring in now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder , and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows .
By the Lord , thou sayest true , lad . And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench
As the honey of Hybla , my old lad of the castle . And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
How now , how now , mad wag What , in thy quips and thy quiddities What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin
Why , what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern
I the great toe why the great toe
For that , being one o’ the lowest , basest , poorest , Of this most wise rebellion , thou go’st foremost Thou rascal , that art worst in blood to run , Lead’st first to win some vantage . But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs Rome and her rats are at the point of battle The one side must have bale .
Hail , noble Martius
Thanks . What’s the matter , you dissentious rogues , That , rubbing the poor itch of your opinion , Make yourselves scabs
We have ever your good word .
He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring . What would you have , you curs , That like nor peace nor war the one affrights you , The other makes you proud . He that trusts to you , Where he should find you lions , finds you hares Where foxes , geese you are no surer , no , Than is the coal of fire upon the ice , Or hailstone in the sun . Your virtue is To make him worthy whose offence subdues him And curse that justice did it . Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate and your affections are A sick man’s appetite , who desires most that Which would increase his evil . He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes . Hang ye Trust Ye With every minute you do change a mind , And call him noble that was now your hate , Him vile that was your garland . What’s the matter , That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble senate , who , Under the gods , keep you in awe , which else Would feed on one another What’s their seeking
You must if you stay here , for here is the place appointed for the wrestling , and they are ready to perform it .
Yonder sure they are coming . Let us now stay and see it .
Wait close . I will not see him .
What’s he that goes there
Come on . Since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
Falstaff , an ’t please your Lordship .
Is yonder the man
He that was in question for the robbery
Even he , madam .
Lo now , if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold , they would make themselves whores but they’d do ’t .
He , my lord but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury , and , as I hear , is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster .
Alas , he is too young . Yet he looks successfully .
What , to York Call him back again .
How now , daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to see the wrestling
Not he . The Queen .
Sir John Falstaff
Ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
You will take little delight in it , I can tell you , there is such odds in the man . In pity of the challenger’s youth , I would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated . Speak to him , ladies see if you can move him .
You must speak louder . My master is deaf .
Call him hither , good Monsieur Le Beau .
I am sure he is , to the hearing of any thing good . Go pluck him by the elbow . I must speak with him .
Was he not here
Do so . I’ll not be by .
Sir John
No , madam .
What , a young knave and begging Is there not wars Is there not employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not the rebels need soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but one , it is worse shame to beg than to be on the
He was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him . Enobarbus
Madam
Here at your service . My lord approaches .
We will not look upon him . Go with us .
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
Against my brother Lucius
Ay . But soon that war had end , and the time’s state Made friends of them , joining their force ’gainst Caesar , Whose better issue in the war from Italy Upon the first encounter drave them .
I crave your pardon . Soon at five o clock , Please you , I’ll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime . My present business calls me from you now .
Hang ’em They say They’ll sit by the fire , and presume to know What’s done i’ the Capitol who’s like to rise , Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out Conjectural marriages making parties strong And feebling such as stand not in their liking Below their cobbled shoes . They say there’s grain enough Would the nobility lay aside their ruth , And let me use my sword , I’ll make a quarry With thousands of these quarter’d slaves , as high As I could pick my lance .
Nay , these are almost thoroughly persuaded For though abundantly they lack discretion , Yet are they passing cowardly . But , I beseech you , What says the other troop
Monsieur the challenger , the Princess calls for you .
They are dissolved hang ’em They said they were an hungry sigh’d forth proverbs , That hunger broke stone walls , that dogs must eat , That meat was made for mouths , that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only with these shreds They vented their complainings which being answer’d , And a petition granted them , a strange one To break the heart of generosity , And make bold power look pale they threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o’ the moon , Shouting their emulation .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the wrestler
No , fair princess . He is the general challenger . I come but in as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
Young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years . You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength . If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise . We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
Do , young sir . Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized . We will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward .
What was th impediment that broke this off
I beseech you , punish me not with your hard thoughts , wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything . But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if I be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so . I shall do my friends no wrong , for I have none to lament me the world no injury , for in it I have nothing . Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty .
The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience . And the hour , I think , is come To give him hearing . Is it four o clock
The little strength that I have , I would it were with you .
And mine , to eke out hers .
Then go we in to know his embassy , Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it .
I’ll wait upon you , and I long to hear it .
worst side , were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it .
You mistake me , sir .
Why sir , did I say you were an honest man Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside , I had lied in my throat if I had said so .
I pray you , sir , then set your knighthood and our soldiership aside , and give me leave to tell you , you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man .
I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which grows to me If thou gett’st any leave of me , hang me if thou tak’st leave , thou wert better be hanged . You hunt counter . Hence Avaunt
Sir , my lord would speak with you .
My good lord . God give your Lordship good time of the day . I am glad to see your Lordship abroad . I heard say your Lordship was sick I hope your Lordship goes abroad by advice . Your Lordship , though not clean past your youth , have yet some smack of an ague in you , some relish of the saltness of time in you , and I most humbly beseech your Lordship to have a reverent care of your health .
An ’t please your Lordship , I hear his Majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales .
Well , thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft .
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part
No , I’ll give thee thy due . Thou hast paid all there .
Farewell till then . I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city .
Sir , I commend you to your own content .
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get . I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop , Who , falling there to find his fellow forth , Unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself . So I , to find a mother and a brother , In quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
Here comes the almanac of my true date . What now How chance thou art returned so soon
Returned so soon Rather approach’d too late The capon burns the pig falls from the spit The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell My mistress made it one upon my cheek . She is so hot because the meat is cold The meat is cold because you come not home You come not home because you have no stomach You have no stomach , having broke your fast But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray Are penitent for your default today .
Good now , sit down and tell me , he that knows , Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land , And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war , Why such impress of shipwrights , whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week . What might be toward , that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day Who is ’t that can inform me
That can I . At least , the whisper goes so our last king , Whose image even but now appeared to us , Was , as you know , by Fortinbras of Norway , Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride , Dared to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet Did slay this Fortinbras , who by a sealed compact Well ratified by law and heraldry , Did forfeit , with his life , all those his lands Which he stood seized of to the conqueror , Against the which a moiety competent Was gagèd by our king , which had returned To the inheritance of Fortinbras Had he been vanquisher , as , by the same covenant And carriage of the article designed , His fell to Hamlet . Now , sir , young Fortinbras , Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full , Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes , For food and diet , to some enterprise That hath a stomach in ’t , which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us , by strong hand
What is granted them
Fare you well . Pray heaven I be deceived in you .
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms , Of their own choice one’s Junius Brutus , Sicinius Velutus , and I know not ’Sdeath The rabble should have first unroof’d the city , Ere so prevail’d with me it will in time Win upon power and throw forth greater themes For insurrection’s arguing .
Your heart’s desires be with you .
This is strange .
Come , where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth
Go , get you home , you fragments
Where’s Caius Martius
You shall try but one fall .
Here what’s the matter
The news is , sir , the Volsces are in arms .
You mean to mock me after , you should not have mocked me before . But come your ways .
I am glad on ‘t then we shall ha’ means to vent Our musty superfluity . See , our best elders .
Now Hercules be thy speed , young man
I would I were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
Martius , ’tis true that you have lately told us The Volsces are in arms .
O excellent young man
Yea , and elsewhere , so far as my coin would stretch , and where it would not , I have used my credit .
No , thou shalt .
Shall I O rare By the Lord , I’ll be a brave judge .
Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves , and so become a rare hangman .
Well , Hal , well , and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court , I can tell you .
For obtaining of suits
When it concerns the fool or coward . On . Things that are past are done , with me . ’Tis thus Who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , I hear him as he flattered .
Antony , thou wouldst say .
O my lord
Speak to me home . Mince not the general tongue . Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome . Rail thou in Fulvia’s phrase , and taunt my faults With such full license as both truth and malice Have power to utter . Oh , then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us Is as our earing .
Fare thee well awhile .
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye , I can tell who should down .
I talk not of his Majesty . You would not come when I sent for you .
And I hear , moreover , his Highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy .
No more , no more .
Well , God mend him . I pray you let me speak with you .
Yes , I beseech your Grace . I am not yet well breathed .
This apoplexy , as I take it , is a kind of lethargy , an ’t please your Lordship , a kind of sleeping in the blood , a whoreson tingling .
How dost thou , Charles
What tell you me of it Be it as it is .
He cannot speak , my lord .
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury
It hath its original from much grief , from study , and perturbation of the brain . I have read the cause of his effects in Galen . It is a kind of deafness .
Bear him away . What is thy name , young man
Not here in presence .
Orlando , my liege , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
Send for him , good uncle .
Very well , my lord , very well . Rather , an ’t please you , it is the disease of not listening , the malady of not marking , that I am troubled withal .
Shall we call in th ambassador , my liege
To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears , and I care not if I do become your physician .
I would thou hadst been son to some man else . The world esteemed thy father honorable , But I did find him still mine enemy . Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house . But fare thee well . Thou art a gallant youth . I would thou hadst told me of another father .
I am as poor as Job , my lord , but not so patient . Your Lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty , but how should I be your patient to follow your prescriptions , the wise may make some dram of a scruple , or indeed a scruple itself .
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it .
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son , His youngest son , and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick .
Sure we thank you . My learnèd lord , we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim . And God forbid , my dear and faithful lord , That you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate , whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation
At your noble pleasure .
From Sicyon , how , the news Speak there .
The man from Sicyon
Is there such an one
He stays upon your will .
Let him appear .
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break , Or lose myself in dotage .
What are you
Fulvia thy wife is dead .
Where died she
In Sicyon . Her length of sickness , with what else more serious Importeth thee to know , this bears .
Forbear me .
There’s a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it . What our contempts doth often hurl from us We wish it ours again . The present pleasure , By revolution lowering , does become The opposite of itself . She’s good , being gone . The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on . I must from this enchanting Queen break off . Ten thousand harms , more than the ills I know My idleness doth hatch . How now , Enobarbus
And terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands So by his father lost . And this , I take it , Is the main motive of our preparations , The source of this our watch , and the chief head Of this posthaste and rummage in the land .
I think it be no other but e en so . Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armèd through our watch so like the king That was and is the question of these wars .
A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye . In the most high and palmy state of Rome , A little ere the mightiest Julius fell , The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , Disasters in the sun , and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse . And even the like precurse of feared events , As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on , Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen .
But soft , behold Lo , where it comes again . I’ll cross it though it blast me . Stay , illusion
If thou hast any sound or use of voice , Speak to me .
O , sixpence , that I had o Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress crupper The saddler had it , sir I kept it not .
I am not in a sportive humor now . Tell me , and dally not where is the money We being strangers here , how dar’st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody
I pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner . I from my mistress come to you in post If I return , I shall be post indeed , For she will scour your fault upon my pate . Methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , And strike you home without a messenger .
Come , Dromio , come , these jests are out of season . Reserve them till a merrier hour than this . Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee
Come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house , the Phoenix , sir , to dinner . My mistress and her sister stays for you .
Now , as I am a Christian , answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money , Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed . Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul , And all the world was of my father’s mind . Had I before known this young man his son , I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured .
Gentle cousin , Let us go thank him and encourage him . My father’s rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart . Sir , you have well deserved . If you do keep your promises in love But justly , as you have exceeded all promise , Your mistress shall be happy .
Gentleman , Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means . Shall we go , coz
Ay . Fare you well , fair gentleman .
Can I not say I thank you My better parts Are all thrown down , and that which here stands up Is but a quintain , a mere lifeless block .
He calls us back . My pride fell with my fortunes . I’ll ask him what he would . Did you call , sir Sir , you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies .
Will you go , coz
Of what your reverence shall incite us to . Therefore take heed how you impawn our person , How you awake our sleeping sword of war . We charge you in the name of God , take heed , For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood , whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe , a sore complaint Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords That make such waste in brief mortality . Under this conjuration , speak , my lord , For we will hear , note , and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism .
Have with you . Fare you well .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers That owe yourselves , your lives , and services To this imperial throne . There is no bar To make against your Highness claim to France But this , which they produce from Pharamond In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant , Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France , and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar . Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salic is in Germany , Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe , Where Charles the Great , having subdued the Saxons , There left behind and settled certain French , Who , holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life , Established then this law to wit , no female Should be inheritrix in Salic land , Which Salic , as I said , ’twixt Elbe and Sala Is at this day in Germany called Meissen .
Were half to half the world by the ears and he . Upon my party , I’ld revolt to make Only my wars with him he is a lion That I am proud to hunt .
Then , worthy Martius , Attend upon Cominius to these wars .
It is your former promise .
Sir , it is And I am constant . Titus Lartius , thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus’ face . What , art thou stiff stand’st out
No , Caius Martius I’ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t’other , Ere stay behind this business .
O , true bred
Your company to the Capitol where , I know , Our greatest friends attend us .
Lead you on .
Right worthy you priority .
Noble Martius
Hence to your homes be gone
What’s your pleasure , sir
I must with haste from hence .
Why , then , we kill all our women . We see how mortal an unkindness is to them . If they suffer our departure , death’s the word .
I must be gone .
She is cunning past man’s thought .
Alack , sir , no , her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love . We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears . They are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report . This cannot be cunning in her . If it be , she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove .
I have some marks of yours upon my pate , Some of my mistress marks upon my shoulders , But not a thousand marks between you both . If I should pay your worship those again , Perchance you will not bear them patiently .
Thy mistress marks what mistress , slave , hast thou
Your worship’s wife , my mistress at the Phoenix , She that doth fast till you come home to dinner And prays that you will hie you home to dinner .
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue I cannot speak to her , yet she urged conference . O poor Orlando Thou art overthrown . Or Charles or something weaker masters thee .
What , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , Being forbid There , take you that , sir knave .
Good sir , I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place . Albeit you have deserved High commendation , true applause , and love , Yet such is now the duke’s condition That he misconsters all that you have done . The duke is humorous . What he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak of .
What mean you , sir For God’s sake , hold your hands . Nay , an you will not , sir , I’ll take my heels .
I thank you , sir , and pray you tell me this Which of the two was daughter of the duke That here was at the wrestling
Upon my life , by some device or other The villain is o erraught of all my money . They say this town is full of cozenage , As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , Dark working sorcerers that change the mind , Soul killing witches that deform the body , Disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , And many suchlike liberties of sin . If it prove so , I will be gone the sooner . I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave . I greatly fear my money is not safe .
Neither his daughter , if we judge by manners , But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter The other is daughter to the banished duke , And here detained by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company , whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters . But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta en displeasure gainst his gentle niece , Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father’s sake And , on my life , his malice gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth . Sir , fare you well . Hereafter , in a better world than this , I shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
I sent for you , when there were matters against you for your life , to come speak with me .
As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land service , I did not come .
Well , the truth is , Sir John , you live in great infamy .
He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less .
Your means are very slender , and your waste is great .
I would it were otherwise . I would my means were greater and my waist slender .
You have misled the youthful Prince .
The young Prince hath misled me . I am the fellow with the great belly , and he my dog .
Would I had never seen her
O sir , you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel .
Yea , for obtaining of suits , whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe . Sblood , I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear .
Or an old lion , or a lover’s lute .
Yea , or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe .
What sayest thou to a hare , or the melancholy of Moorditch
Nay , let them follow The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither To gnaw their garners . Worshipful mutiners , Your valour puts well forth pray , follow .
Thou hast the most unsavory similes , and art indeed the most comparative , rascaliest , sweet young Prince . But , Hal , I comparative , rascaliest , sweet young Prince . But , Hal , I prithee trouble me no more with vanity . I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought . An old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you , sir , but I marked him not , and yet he talked very wisely , but I regarded him not , and yet he talked wisely , and in the street , too .
Thou didst well , for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it .
Was ever man so proud as is this Martius
He has no equal .
O , thou hast damnable iteration , and art indeed able to corrupt a saint . Thou hast done much harm upon me , Hal , God forgive thee for it . Before I knew thee , Hal , I knew nothing , and now am I , if a man should speak truly , little better than one of the wicked . I must give over this life , and I will give it over . By the Lord , an I do not , I am a villain . I’ll be damned for never a king’s son in Christendom .
When we were chosen tribunes for the people ,
Mark’d you his lip and eyes
Nay . ut his taunts .
Being moved , he will not spare to gird the gods .
Be mock the modest moon .
The present wars devour him he is grown Too proud to be so valiant .
Such a nature , Tickled with good success , disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon but I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under Cominius .
Fame , at the which he aims , In whom already he’s well graced , can not Better be held nor more attain’d than by A place below the first for what miscarries Shall be the general’s fault , though he perform To the utmost of a man , and giddy censure Will then cry out of Martius ‘O if he Had borne the business ’
I rest much bounden to you . Fare you well .
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother , From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother . But heavenly Rosalind
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me , Speak to me . If thou art privy to thy country’s fate , Which happily foreknowing may avoid , Oh , speak Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth , For which , they say , you spirits oft walk in death , Speak of it . Stay and speak
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master Sure , Luciana , it is two o clock .
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him , And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner . Good sister , let us dine and never fret . A man is master of his liberty Time is their master , and when they see time They’ll go or come . If so , be patient , sister .
Stop it , Marcellus .
Why should their liberty than ours be more
Shall I strike at it with my partisan
Because their business still lies out o door .
Look when I serve him so , he takes it ill .
O , know he is the bridle of your will .
There’s none but asses will be bridled so .
Well , I am loath to gall a new healed wound . Your day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s exploit on Gad’s HillThe robbery at Gad’s Hill occurs in Henry IV , Part One . Gad’s Hill . You may thank th unquiet time for your quiet o erposting that action .
Why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe . There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye But hath his bound , in earth , in sea , in sky . The beasts , the fishes , and the wingèd fowls Are their males subjects and at their controls . Man , more divine , the masters of all these ,
My lord .
But since all is well , keep it so . Wake not a sleeping wolf .
Do , if it will not stand .
Tis here .
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow , Jack
Besides , if things go well , Opinion that so sticks on Martius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers That owe yourselves , your lives , and services To this imperial throne . There is no bar To make against your Highness claim to France But this , which they produce from Pharamond In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant , Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France , and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar . Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salic is in Germany , Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe , Where Charles the Great , having subdued the Saxons , There left behind and settled certain French , Who , holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life , Established then this law to wit , no female Should be inheritrix in Salic land , Which Salic , as I said , ’twixt Elbe and Sala Is at this day in Germany called Meissen . Then doth it well appear the Salic law Was not devisèd for the realm of France , Nor did the French possess the Salic land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond , Idly supposed the founder of this law Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twenty six and Charles the Great Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala in the year Eight hundred five . Besides , their writers say , King Pepin , which deposèd Childeric , Did , as heir general , being descended Of Blithild , which was daughter to King Clothair , Make claim and title to the crown of France . Hugh Capet also , who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine , sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great , To find his title with some shows of truth , Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught , Conveyed himself as th heir to th Lady Lingare , Daughter to Charlemagne , who was the son To Lewis the Emperor , and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great . Also King Lewis the Tenth , Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , Could not keep quiet in his conscience , Wearing the crown of France , till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel , his grandmother , Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare , Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine , By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France . So that , as clear as is the summer’s sun , King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim , King Lewis his satisfaction , all appear To hold in right and title of the female .
Come Half all Cominius’ honours are to Martius . Though Martius earned them not , and all his faults To Martius shall be honours , though indeed In aught he merit not .
Zounds , where thou wilt , lad . I’ll make one . An I do not , call me villain and baffle me .
Let’s hence , and hear How the dispatch is made , and in what fashion , More than his singularity , he goes Upon this present action .
Lets along .
I see a good amendment of life in thee , from praying to purse taking .
Tis gone . We do it wrong , being so majestical , To offer it the show of violence , For it is , as the air , invulnerable , And our vain blows malicious mockery .
It was about to speak when the cock crew .
This servitude makes you to keep unwed .
Not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
But , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
Ere I learn love , I’ll practice to obey .
How if your husband start some otherwhere
Till he come home again , I would forbear .
Patience unmoved No marvel though she pause They can be meek that have no other cause . A wretched soul , bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry , But were we burdened with like weight of pain , As much or more we should ourselves complain . So thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , With urging helpless patience would relieve me But , if thou live to see like right bereft , This fool begged patience in thee will be left .
Fulvia is dead .
To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox .
Sir
Well , I will marry one day , but to try . Here comes your man . Now is your husband nigh .
What , you are as a candle , the better part burnt out .
Fulvia is dead .
A wassail candle , my lord , all tallow . If I did say of wax , my growth would approve the truth .
Fulvia
Dead .
Why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice . When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him , it shows to man the tailors of the earth , comforting therein , that when old robes are worn out , there are members to make new . If there were no more women but Fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented . This grief is crowned with consolation . Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat , and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
Why , cousin Why , Rosalind Cupid have mercy , not a word
You follow the young Prince up and down like his ill angel .
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence .
Not one to throw at a dog .
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you , especially that of Cleopatra’s , which wholly depends on your abode .
Not so , my lord . Your ill angel is light , but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing . And yet in some respects I grant I cannot go . I cannot tell . Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers times that true valor is turned bear herd pregnancy is made a tapster , and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings . All the other gifts appurtenant to man , as the malice of this age shapes them , are not worth a gooseberry . You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young . You do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls , and we that are in the vaward of our youth , I must confess , are wags too .
No , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs . Throw some of them at me . Come , lame me with reasons .
Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth , that are written down old with all the characters of age Have you not a moist eye , a dry hand , a yellow cheek , a white beard ,
But is all this for your father
No , some of it is for my child’s father . Oh , how full of briers is this working day world
They are but burs , cousin , thrown upon thee in holiday foolery . If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
I could shake them off my coat . These burs are in my heart .
Hem them away .
I would try , if I could cry hem and have him .
So do the kings of France unto this day , Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors .
Come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
May I with right and conscience make this claim
The sin upon my head , dread sovereign , For in the Book of Numbers is it writ When the man dies , let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter . Gracious lord , Stand for your own , unwind your bloody flag , Look back into your mighty ancestors . Go , my dread lord , to your great grandsire’s tomb , From whom you claim . Invoke his warlike spirit And your great uncle’s , Edward the Black Prince , Who on the French ground played a tragedy , Making defeat on the full power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp Forage in blood of French nobility . O noble English , that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by , All out of work and cold for action
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats . You are their heir , you sit upon their throne , The blood and courage that renownèd them Runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege Is in the very May morn of his youth , Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises .
Why , Hal , ’tis my vocation , Hal . Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation .
Poins Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match . O , if men were to be saved by merit , what hole in hell were hot enough for him This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand to a true man .
Good morrow , Ned .
Good morrow , sweet Hal . What says Monsieur Remorse What says Sir John Sack and Sugar Jack , how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg
Sir John stands to his word . The devil shall have his bargain , for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs . He will give the devil his due .
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil .
No more light answers . Let our officers Have notice what we purpose . I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part . For not alone The death of Fulvia , with more urgent touches , Do strongly speak to us , but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home . Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands The empire of the sea . Our slippery people , Whose love is never linked to the deserver Till his deserts are past , begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son , who high in name and power , Higher than both in blood and life stands up For the main soldier , whose quality , going on , The sides o’ th’ world may danger . Much is breeding Which , like the courser’s hair , hath yet but life , And not a serpent’s poison . Say our pleasure , To such whose place is under us , requires Our quick remove from hence .
Say , is your tardy master now at hand
Nay , he’s at two hands with me , and that my two ears can witness .
Say , didst thou speak with him Know’st thou his mind
Ay , ay , he told his mind upon mine ear . Beshrew his hand , I scarce could understand it .
Nay , he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows , and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them .
But say , I prithee , is he coming home It seems he hath great care to please his wife .
Why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
Horn mad , thou villain
I mean not cuckold mad , But sure he is stark mad . When I desired him to come home to dinner , He asked me for a thousand marks in gold . Tis dinnertime , quoth I . My gold , quoth he .
So , your opinion is , Aufidius , That they of Rome are entered in our counsels And know how we proceed .
Is it not yours What ever have been thought on in this state , That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome Had circumvention ’Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence these are the words I think I have the letter here yes , here it is .
My lord , I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon , with a white head and something a round belly . For my voice , I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems . To approve my youth further , I will not . The truth is , I am only old in judgment and understanding . And he that will caper with me for a thousand marks , let him lend me the money , and have at him For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you , he gave it like a rude prince , and you took it like a sensible lord . I have checked him for it , and the young lion repents . Marry , not in ashes and sackcloth , but in new silk and old sack .
Well , God send the Prince a better companion .
‘They have press’d a power , but it is not known Whether for east or west the dearth is great The people mutinous and it is rumour’d , Cominius , Martius your old enemy , Who is of Rome worse hated than of you , And Titus Lartius , a most valiant Roman , These three lead on this preparation Whither ’tis bent most likely ’tis for you Consider of it . ’
Well , the King hath severed you and Prince Harry . I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland .
Yea , I thank your pretty sweet wit for it . But look you pray , all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home , that our armies join not in a hot day , for , by the Lord , I take but two shirts out with me , and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily . If it be a hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle , I would I might never spit white again . There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it . Well , I cannot last ever .
Oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself As did the former lions of your blood .
Oh , a good wish upon you . You will try in time , in despite of a fall . But turning these jests out of service , let us talk in good earnest . Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might So hath your Highness . Never king of England Had nobles richer , and more loyal subjects , Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France .
The duke my father loved his father dearly .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear liege , With blood and sword and fire to win your right , In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors .
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly . Yet I hate not Orlando .
We must not only arm t invade the French , But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot , who will make road upon us With all advantages .
I shall do ’t .
No , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
They of those marches , gracious sovereign , Shall be a wall sufficient to defend Our inland from the pilfering borderers .
Why should I not Doth he not deserve well
Let me love him for that , and do you love him because I do . Look , here comes the duke .
With his eyes full of anger .
Mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , And get you from our court .
Me , uncle
You , cousin . Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles , Thou diest for it .
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil .
But , my lads , my lads , tomorrow morning , by four o clock , early at Gad’s Hill , there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings , and traders riding to London with fat purses . I have vizards for you all . You have horses for yourselves . Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester . I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap . We may do it as secure as sleep . If you will go , I will stuff your purses full of crowns . If you will not , tarry at home and be hanged .
Hear ye , Yedward , if I tarry at home and go not , I’ll hang you for going .
Hal , wilt thou make one
Who , I rob I a thief not I , by my faith .
There’s neither honesty , manhood , nor good fellowship in thee , nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal , if thou darest not stand for ten shillings .
Well then , once in my days I’ll be a madcap .
Where is he
Well , come what will , I’ll tarry at home .
I did not see him since .
See where he is , who’s with him , what he does . I did not send you . If you find him sad , Say I am dancing . If in mirth , report That I am sudden sick . Quick , and return .
Madam , methinks , if you did love him dearly , You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him .
What should I do I do not
In each thing give him way . Cross him in nothing .
Tempt him not so too far . I wish , forbear . In time we hate that which we often fear .
But here comes Antony .
I am sick and sullen .
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons . I have heard The cock , that is the trumpet to the morn , Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat Awake the god of day , and , at his warning , Whether in sea or fire , in earth or air , Th extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine , and of the truth herein This present object made probation .
It faded on the crowing of the cock . Some say that ever gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated , The bird of dawning singeth all night long . And then , they say , no spirit dare stir abroad . The nights are wholesome . Then no planets strike , No fairy takes , nor witch hath power to charm , So hallowed and so gracious is that time .
So have I heard and do in part believe it . But look , the morn , in russet mantle clad , Walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill . Break we our watch up , and by my advice , Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet , for , upon my life , This spirit , dumb to us , will speak to him . Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needful in our loves , fitting our duty
Let’s do ’t , I pray , and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently .
I do beseech your Grace , Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me . If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires , If that I do not dream or be not frantic As I do trust I am not then , dear uncle , Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness .
Thus do all traitors . If their purgation did consist in words , They are as innocent as grace itself . Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not .
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor . Tell me whereon the likelihood depends .
Thou art thy father’s daughter . There’s enough .
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom . So was I when your Highness banished him . Treason is not inherited , my lord , Or if we did derive it from our friends , What’s that to me My father was no traitor . Then , good my liege , mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous .
Dear sovereign , hear me speak .
Ay , Celia , we stayed her for your sake . Else had she with her father ranged along .
Now , my dearest Queen
She hath been then more feared than harmed , my liege , For hear her but exampled by herself When all her chivalry hath been in France And she a mourning widow of her nobles , She hath herself not only well defended But taken and impounded as a stray The king of Scots , whom she did send to France To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings And make her chronicle as rich with praise As is the ooze and bottom of the sea With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries .
Pray you , stand farther from me .
But there’s a saying very old and true If that you will France win , Then with Scotland first begin . For once the eagle England being in prey , To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , Playing the mouse in absence of the cat , To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat .
What’s the matter
I know by that same eye there’s some good news . What , says the married woman you may go Would she had never given you leave to come Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here . I have no power upon you . Hers you are .
It follows , then , the cat must stay at home . Yet that is but a crushed necessity , Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves . While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad , Th advisèd head defends itself at home . For government , though high and low and lower , Put into parts , doth keep in one consent , Congreeing in a full and natural close , Like music .
The gods best know

Why should I think you can be mine , and true Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness , To be entangled with those mouth made vows Which break themselves in swearing
Most sweet Queen
Nay , pray you , seek no color for your going , But bid farewell and go . When you sued staying , Then was the time for words . No going then Eternity was in our lips and eyes , Bliss in our brows’ bent , none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven . They are so still , Or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , Art turned the greatest liar .
Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veil’d till when They needs must show themselves which in the hatching , It seem’d , appear’d to Rome . By the discovery . We shall be shorten’d in our aim , which was To take in many towns ere almost Rome Should know we were afoot .
Noble Aufidius , Take your commission hie you to your bands Let us alone to guard Corioli If they set down before ’s , for the remove Bring your army but , I think , you’ll find They’ve not prepared for us .
The gods assist you
But it was always yet the trick of our English nation , if they have a good thing , to make it too common . If ye will needs say I am an old man , you should give me rest . I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is . I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion .
Well , be honest , be honest and God bless your expedition
Will your Lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth
Not a penny , not a penny . You are too impatient to bear crosses . Fare you well . Commend me to my cousin Westmoreland .
If I do , fillip me with a three man beetle . A man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one , and the pox pinches the other , and so both the degrees prevent my curses . Boy
Sir .
What money is in my purse
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse . Borrowing only lingers and lingers it out , but the disease is incurable . Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster , this to the Prince , this to the Earl of Westmoreland and this to old Mistress Ursula , whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair on my chin . About it . You know where to find me .
How now , lady
I would I had thy inches . Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt .
Hear me , Queen The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile , but my full heart Remains in use with you . Our Italy Shines o’er with civil swords . Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome . Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction . The hated , grown to strength , Are newly grown to love . The condemned Pompey , Rich in his father’s honor , creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state , whose numbers threaten And quietness , grown sick of rest , would purge By any desperate change . My more particular , And that which most with you should safe my going , Is Fulvia’s death .
Though age from folly could not give me freedom , It does from childishness . Can Fulvia die
She’s dead , my Queen .
She is too subtle for thee , and her smoothness , Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people , and they pity her . Thou art a fool . She robs thee of thy name , And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone . Then open not thy lips . Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her . She is banished .
Pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege . I cannot live out of her company .
O my poor Rosalind , whither wilt thou go Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine . I charge thee , be not thou more grieved than I am .
I have more cause .
Look here , and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awaked , at the last , best , See when and where she died .
Cut my lace , Charmian , come But let it be . I am quickly ill , and well , So Antony loves .
Therefore doth heaven divide The state of man in diverse functions , Setting endeavor in continual motion , To which is fixèd as an aim or butt Obedience for so work the honeybees , Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom . They have a king and officers of sorts , Where some like magistrates correct at home , Others like merchants venture trade abroad , Others like soldiers armèd in their stings Make boot upon the summer’s velvet buds , Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent royal of their emperor , Who , busied in his majesty , surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold , The civil citizens kneading up the honey , The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate , The sad eyed justice with his surly hum Delivering o er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone . I this infer That many things , having full reference To one consent , may work contrariously , As many arrows loosèd several ways Come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , As many lines close in the dial’s center , So may a thousand actions , once afoot , End in one purpose , and be all well borne Without defeat . Therefore to France , my liege Divide your happy England into four , Whereof take you one quarter into France , And you withal shall make all Gallia shake .
My precious Queen , forbear , And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial .
So Fulvia told me . I prithee , turn aside and weep for her . Then bid adieu to me , and say the tears Belong to Egypt . Good now , play one scene Of excellent dissembling , and let it look Like perfect honor .
Your meat doth burn , quoth I . My gold , quoth he . Will you come quoth I . My gold , quoth he . Where is the thousand marks I gave thee , villain The pig , quoth I , is burned . My gold , quoth he . My mistress , sir , quoth I . Hang up thy mistress I know not thy mistress . Out on thy mistress
Quoth who
Quoth my master . I know , quoth he , no house , no wife , no mistress . So that my errand , due unto my tongue , I thank him , I bare home upon my shoulders , For , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
Go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
Go back again and be new beaten home For God’s sake , send some other messenger .
Back , slave , or I will break thy pate across .
I care not .
And he will bless that cross with other beating . Between you , I shall have a holy head .
Sir John , I prithee , leave the Prince and me alone . I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go .
Well , God give thee the spirit of persuasion , and him the ears of profiting , that what thou speakest may move , and what he hears may be believed , that the true prince may , for recreation sake , prove a false thief , for the poor abuses of the time want countenance . Farewell . You shall find me in Eastcheap .
Farewell , thou latter spring . Farewell , All hallown summer .
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death The memory be green , and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe , Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves . Therefore our sometime sister , now our queen , Th imperial jointress to this warlike state , Have we as ’twere with a defeated joy , With an auspicious and a dropping eye , With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage , In equal scale weighing delight and dole Taken to wife . Nor have we herein barred Your better wisdoms , which have freely gone With this affair along . For all , our thanks . Now follows that you know . Young Fortinbras , Holding a weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame , Colleaguèd with the dream of his advantage , He hath not failed to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father , with all bonds of law , To our most valiant brother . So much for him .
Fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
You’ll heat my blood . No more .
You can do better yet , but this is meetly .
Now , by my sword
A pox of this gout Or , a gout of this pox , for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe . Tis no matter if I do halt . I have the wars for my color , and my pension shall seem the more reasonable . A good wit will make use of anything . I will turn diseases to commodity .
And target . Still he mends . But this is not the best . Look , prithee , Charmian , How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe .
I’ll leave you , lady .
Courteous lord , one word . Sir , you and I must part , but that’s not it . Sir , you and I have loved , but there’s not it , That you know well . Something it is I would Oh , my oblivion is a very Antony , And I am all forgotten .
But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject , I should take you For idleness itself .
’Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this . But , sir , forgive me , Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you . Your honor calls you hence . Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , And all the gods go with you Upon your sword Sit laurel victory , and smooth success Be strewed before your feet .
Now , my good sweet honey lord , ride with us tomorrow . I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone . Falstaff , Peto , Bardolph , and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid . Yourself and I will not be there . And when they have the booty , if you and I do not rob them , cut this head off from my shoulders .
If we , with thrice such powers left at home , Cannot defend our own doors from the dog , Let us be worried , and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy .
Why , we will set forth before or after them , and appoint them a place of meeting , wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves , which they shall have no sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them .
Let us go . Come . Our separation so abides and flies That thou , residing here , goes yet with me , And I , hence fleeting , here remain with thee . Away
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
Yea , but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses , by our habits , and by every other appointment to be ourselves .
Now are we well resolved , and by God’s help And yours , the noble sinews of our power , France being ours , we’ll bend it to our awe Or break it all to pieces . Or there we’ll sit , Ruling in large and ample empery O er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms , Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn , Tombless , with no remembrance over them . Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts , or else our grave , Like Turkish mute , shall have a tongueless mouth , Not worshipped with a waxen epitaph .
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin , for we hear Your greeting is from him , not from the king .
May ’t please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge , Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy
Farewell .
Farewell .
Thou hast not , cousin . Prithee , be cheerful . Know’st thou not the duke Hath banished me , his daughter
That he hath not .
No , hath not Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one . Shall we be sundered Shall we part , sweet girl No , let my father seek another heir . Therefore devise with me how we may fly , Whither to go , and what to bear with us , And do not seek to take your change upon you , To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out . For , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , Say what thou canst , I’ll go along with thee .
Why , whither shall we go
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden .
Alas , what danger will it be to us , Maids as we are , to travel forth so far Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face . The like do you . So shall we pass along And never stir assailants .
Were it not better , Because that I am more than common tall , That I did suit me all points like a man A gallant curtal axe upon my thigh , A boar spear in my hand , and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will , We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances .
Farewell .
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means , And , my most noble friends , I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes . And first , Lord Marshal , what say you to it
You may see , Lepidus , and henceforth know , It is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate Our great competitor . From Alexandria This is the news he fishes , drinks , and wastes The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike Than Cleopatra , nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he hardly gave audience , or Vouchsafed to think he had partners . You shall find there A man who is th’ abstract of all faults That all men follow .
I well allow the occasion of our arms , But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King .
I must not think there are Evils enough to darken all his goodness . His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven , More fiery by night’s blackness , hereditary Rather than purchased , what he cannot change Than what he chooses .
Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice , And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland , whose bosom burns With an incensèd fire of injuries .
The question then , Lord Hastings , standeth thus Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland .
With him we may .
You are too indulgent . Let’s grant , it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy , To give a kingdom for a mirth , to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave , To reel the streets at noon , and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat . Say this becomes him As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness . If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness , Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for ’t . But to confound such time That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud As his own state and ours , ’tis to be chid As we rate boys who , being mature in knowledge , Pawn their experience to their present pleasure And so rebel to judgment .
What shall I call thee when thou art a man
Something that hath a reference to my state No longer Celia , but Aliena .
Thus much the business is we have here writ To Norway , uncle of young Fortinbras Who , impotent and bedrid , scarcely hears Of this his nephew’s purpose to suppress His further gait herein , in that the levies , The lists , and full proportions are all made Out of his subject and we here dispatch You , good Cornelius , and you , Voltemand , For bearers of this greeting to old Norway , Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow . Farewell , and let your haste commend your duty .
But , cousin , what if we assayed to steal The clownish fool out of your father’s court Would he not be a comfort to our travel
In that and all things will we show our duty .
He’ll go along o er the wide world with me . Leave me alone to woo him . Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together , Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight . Now go we in content To liberty , and not to banishment .
We doubt it nothing . Heartily farewell .
And now , Laertes , what’s the news with you You told us of some suit . What is ’t , Laertes You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice . What wouldst thou beg , Laertes , That shall not be my offer , not thy asking The head is not more native to the heart , The hand more instrumental to the mouth , Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father . What wouldst thou have , Laertes
Here’s more news .
My dread lord , Your leave and favor to return to France , From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation , Yet now , I must confess , that duty done , My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon .
Thy biddings have been done , and every hour , Most noble Caesar , shalt thou have report How ’tis abroad . Pompey is strong at sea , And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar . To the ports The discontents repair , and men’s reports Give him much wronged .
We are no tyrant , but a Christian king , Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons . Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness Tell us the Dauphin’s mind .
I should have known no less . It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were , And the ebbed man , ne’er loved till ne’er worth love , Comes deared by being lacked . This common body , Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream , Goes to and back , lackeying the varying tide To rot itself with motion .
Thus , then , in few Your Highness , lately sending into France , Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right Of your great predecessor , King Edward the Third In answer of which claim , the prince our master Says that you savor too much of your youth And bids you be advised there’s naught in France That can be with a nimble galliard won . You cannot revel into dukedoms there . He therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , This tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you . This the Dauphin speaks .
What treasure , uncle
Tennis balls , my liege .
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us . His present and your pains we thank you for . When we have matched our rackets to these balls , We will in France , by God’s grace , play a set Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard . Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturbed With chases . And we understand him well , How he comes o er us with our wilder days , Not measuring what use we made of them .
Caesar , I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas , famous pirates , Make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound With keels of every kind . Many hot inroads They make in Italy the borders maritime Lack blood to think on ’t and flush youth revolt . No vessel can peep forth , but ’tis as soon Taken as seen , for Pompey’s name strikes more Than could his war resisted .
His company must do his minions grace , Whilst I at home starve for a merry look . Hath homely age th alluring beauty took From my poor cheek Then he hath wasted it . Are my discourses dull Barren my wit If voluble and sharp discourse be marred , Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard . Do their gay vestments his affections bait That’s not my fault he’s master of my state . What ruins are in me that can be found By him not ruined Then is he the ground Of my defeatures . My decayèd fair A sunny look of his would soon repair . But , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale And feeds from home . Poor I am but his stale .
Self harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
Now , my co mates and brothers in exile , Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court Here feel we not the penalty of Adam , The seasons difference , as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind , Which , when it bites and blows upon my body , Even till I shrink with cold , I smile and say , This is no flattery . These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am . Sweet are the uses of adversity , Which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , Wears yet a precious jewel in his head . And this our life , exempt from public haunt , Finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , Sermons in stones , and good in everything .
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense . I know his eye doth homage otherwhere , Or else what lets it but he would be here Sister , you know he promised me a chain . Would that alone o love he would detain , So he would keep fair quarter with his bed . I see the jewel best enamelèd Will lose his beauty . Yet the gold bides still That others touch , and often touching will Wear gold yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame . Since that my beauty cannot please his eye , I’ll weep what’s left away , and weeping die .
I would not change it . Happy is your Grace , That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style .
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy
Tis very true , Lord Bardolph for indeed It was young Hotspur’s cause at Shrewsbury .
Tut , our horses they shall not see I’ll tie them in the wood . Our vizards we will change after we leave them . And , sirrah , I have cases of buckram for the nonce , to immask our noted outward garments .
Yea , but I doubt they will be too hard for us .
It was , my lord who lined himself with hope , Eating the air on promise of supply , Flatt ring himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts , And so , with great imagination Proper to madmen , led his powers to death And , winking , leapt into destruction .
Well , for two of them , I know them to be as true bred cowards as ever turned back and for the third , if he fight longer than he sees reason , I’ll forswear arms . The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least he fought with , what wards , what blows , what extremities he endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest .
Well , I’ll go with thee . Provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap . There I’ll sup . Farewell .
Antony , Leave thy lascivious wassails . When thou once Wast beaten from Modena , where thou slew’st Hirtius and Pansa , consuls , at thy heel Did famine follow , whom thou fought’st against , Though daintily brought up , with patience more Than savages could suffer . Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at . Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge . Yea , like the stag , when snow the pasture sheets , The barks of trees thou browsèd . On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh , Which some did die to look on . And all this It wounds thine honor that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier , that thy cheek So much as lanked not .
’Tis pity of him .
I know you all , and will awhile uphold The unyoked humor of your idleness . Yet herein will I imitate the sun , Who doth permit the base contagious clouds To smother up his beauty from the world , That , when he please again to be himself , Being wanted , he may be more wondered at By breaking through the foul and ugly mist Of vapors that did seem to strangle him .
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome . ’Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i’ th’ field , and to that end Assemble we immediate council . Pompey Thrives in our idleness .
He hath , my lord , wrung from me my slow leave By laborsome petition , and at last Upon his will I sealed my hard consent . I do beseech you , give him leave to go .
I pray you , daughter , sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband , I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love . When yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my womb , when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way , when for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding , I , considering how honour would become such a person . that it was no better than picture like to hang by the wall , if renown made it not stir , was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame . To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned , his brows bound with oak . I tell thee , daughter , I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man .
Take thy fair hour , Laertes . Time be thine , And thy best graces spend it at thy will . But now , my cousin Hamlet , and my son
But had he died in the business , madam how then
A little more than kin and less than kind .
Then his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue . Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen sons , each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Martius , I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action .
How is it that the clouds still hang on you
Not so , my lord . I am too much i the sun .
Good Hamlet , cast thy nighted color off , And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark . Do not forever with thy vailèd lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust . Thou know’st ’tis common . All that lives must die , Passing through nature to eternity .
Ay , madam , it is common .
If it be , Why seems it so particular with thee
Come , shall we go and kill us venison And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools , Being native burghers of this desert city , Should in their own confines with forkèd heads Have their round haunches gored .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time .
But , by your leave , it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope .
Till which encounter It is my business too . Farewell .
Doubt not , sir . I knew it for my bond .
Yes , if this present quality of war Indeed the instant action , a cause on foot Lives so in hope , as in an early spring We see the appearing buds , which to prove fruit Hope gives not so much warrant as despair That frosts will bite them . When we mean to build , We first survey the plot , then draw the model , And when we see the figure of the house , Then must we rate the cost of the erection , Which if we find outweighs ability , What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices , or at last desist To build at all Much more in this great work , Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down And set another up , should we survey The plot of situation and the model , Consent upon a sure foundation , Question surveyors , know our own estate , How able such a work to undergo , To weigh against his opposite . Or else
Charmian
Madam
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur , and the heedful slave Is wandered forth , in care to seek me out . By computation and mine host’s report , I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart . See , here he comes .
Ha , ha Give me to drink mandragora .
Why , madam
How now , sir is your merry humor altered As you love strokes , so jest with me again . You know no Centaur You received no gold Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad , That thus so madly thou didst answer me
What answer , sir When spake I such a word
You think of him too much .
Even now , even here , not half an hour since .
Oh , ’tis treason
I did not see you since you sent me hence , Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
Madam , I trust , not so .
Thou , eunuch Mardian
Villain , thou didst deny the gold’s receipt And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner , For which , I hope , thou felt’st I was displeased .
What’s your highness’ pleasure
I am glad to see you in this merry vein . What means this jest I pray you , master , tell me
Not now to hear thee sing . I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has . ’Tis well for thee That , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt . Hast thou affections
If all the year were playing holidays , To sport would be as tedious as to work , But when they seldom come , they wished for come , And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents . So when this loose behavior I throw off And pay the debt I never promisèd , By how much better than my word I am , By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes And , like bright metal on a sullen ground , My reformation , glitt ring o er my fault , Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes Than that which hath no foil to set it off . I’ll so offend to make offense a skill , Redeeming time when men think least I will .
Seems , madam Nay , it is . I know not seems . Tis not alone my inky cloak , good mother , Nor customary suits of solemn black , Nor windy suspiration of forced breath , No , nor the fruitful river in the eye , Nor the dejected havior of the visage , Together with all forms , moods , shapes of grief , That can denote me truly . These indeed seem , For they are actions that a man might play . But I have that within which passeth show , These but the trappings and the suits of woe .
Not in deed , madam , for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done . Yet have I fierce affections , and think What Venus did with Mars .
Tis sweet and commendable in your nature , Hamlet , To give these mourning duties to your father . But you must know your father lost a father , That father lost , lost his , and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow . But to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness . Tis unmanly grief . It shows a will most incorrect to heaven , A heart unfortified , a mind impatient , An understanding simple and unschooled . For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense , Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart Fie Tis a fault to heaven , A fault against the dead , a fault to nature , To reason most absurd , whose common theme Is death of fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first corse till he that died today , This must be so . We pray you , throw to earth This unprevailing woe , and think of us As of a father . For let the world take note , You are the most immediate to our throne ,
O Charmian , Where think’st thou he is now Stands he or sits he Or does he walk Or is he on his horse O happy horse , to bear the weight of Antony Do bravely , horse , for wott’st thou whom thou mov’st The demi Atlas of this earth , the arm And burgonet of men . He’s speaking now , Or murmuring Where’s my serpent of old Nile For so he calls me . Now I feed myself With most delicious poison . Think on me , That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time . Broad fronted Caesar , When thou wast here above the ground , I was A morsel for a monarch . And great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow . There would he anchor his aspect , and die With looking on his life .
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore , living hence , did give ourself To barbarous license , as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home . But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state , Be like a king , and show my sail of greatness When I do rouse me in my throne of France , For that I have laid by my majesty And plodded like a man for working days . But I will rise there with so full a glory That I will dazzle all the eyes of France , Yea , strike the Dauphin blind to look on us . And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his Hath turned his balls to gun stones , and his soul Shall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeance That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands , Mock mothers from their sons , mock castles down , And some are yet ungotten and unborn That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn . But this lies all within the will of God , To whom I do appeal , and in whose name Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on , To venge me as I may and to put forth My rightful hand in a well hallowed cause . So get you hence in peace . And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it . Convey them with safe conduct . Fare you well .
This was a merry message .
Sovereign of Egypt , hail
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony Yet , coming from him , that great med’cine hath With his tinct gilded thee . How goes it with my brave Mark Antony
Indeed , my lord , The melancholy Jaques grieves at that , And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banished you . Today my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak , whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood , To the which place a poor sequestered stag That from the hunter’s aim had ta en a hurt Did come to languish . And indeed , my lord , The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting , and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase . And thus the hairy fool , Much markèd of the melancholy Jaques , Stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook , Augmenting it with tears .
Last thing he did , dear Queen , He kissed the last of many doubled kisses This orient pearl .
But what said Jaques Did he not moralize this spectacle
His speech sticks in my heart .
Mine ear must pluck it thence .
Oh , yes , into a thousand similes . First , for his weeping into the needless stream Poor deer , quoth he , thou mak’st a testament As worldlings do , giving thy sum of more To that which had too much . Then , being there alone , Left and abandoned of his velvet friend , Tis right , quoth he . Thus misery doth part The flux of company . Anon a careless herd , Full of the pasture , jumps along by him And never stays to greet him . Ay , quoth Jaques , Sweep on , you fat and greasy citizens . Tis just the fashion . Wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country , city , court , Yea , and of this our life , swearing that we Are mere usurpers , tyrants , and what’s worse , To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assigned and native dwelling place .
Good friend , quoth he , Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , To mend the petty present , I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms . All the East , Say thou , shall call her mistress . So he nodded , And soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed , Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him .
What was he , sad or merry
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes Of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
Madam , the Lady Valeria is come to visit you .
Beseech you , give me leave to retire myself .
And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you . For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg , It is most retrograde to our desire . And we beseech you , bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye , Our chiefest courtier , cousin , and our son .
Let not thy mother lose her prayers , Hamlet . I pray thee , stay with us . Go not to Wittenberg .
Indeed , you shall not . Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum , See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair , As children from a bear , the Volsces shunning him Methinks I see him stamp thus , and call thus ‘Come on , you cowards you were got in fear , Though you were born in Rome ’ his bloody brow With his mail’d hand then wiping , forth he goes , Like to a harvest man that’s task’d to mow Or all or lose his hire .
My blood hath been too cold and temperate , Unapt to stir at these indignities , And you have found me , for accordingly You tread upon my patience . But be sure I will from henceforth rather be myself , Mighty and to be feared , than my condition , Which hath been smooth as oil , soft as young down , And therefore lost that title of respect Which the proud soul ne er pays but to the proud .
I shall in all my best obey you , madam .
Our house , my sovereign liege , little deserves The scourge of greatness to be used on it , And that same greatness too which our own hands Have holp to make so portly .
Why , ’tis a loving and a fair reply . Be as ourself in Denmark . Madam , come . This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart , in grace whereof No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell , And the king’s rouse the heavens shall bruit again , Respeaking earthly thunder . Come away .
My lord
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius
Worcester , get thee gone for I do see Danger and disobedience in thine eye . O sir , your presence is too bold and peremptory , And majesty might never yet endure The moody frontier of a servant brow . You have good leave to leave us . When we need Your use and counsel , we shall send for you .
He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee And tread upon his neck .
Oh , that this too , too sullied flesh would melt , Thaw , and resolve itself into a dew , Or that the Everlasting had not fixed His canon gainst self slaughter O God , God How weary , stale , flat , and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world Fie on ’t , ah fie Tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed . Things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely . That it should come to this . But two months dead nay , not so much , not two . So excellent a king , that was to this Hyperion to a satyr . So loving to my mother
You were about to speak .
O well divided disposition Note him , Note him , good Charmian , ’tis the man , but note him . He was not sad , for he would shine on those That make their looks by his . He was not merry , Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy , but between both . O heavenly mingle Be’st thou sad or merry , The violence of either thee becomes , So does it no man else . Mett’st thou my posts
Ay , madam , twenty several messengers . Why do you send so thick
Who’s born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar . Ink and paper , Charmian . Welcome , my good Alexas . Did I , Charmian , Ever love Caesar so
Be choked with such another emphasis Say , the brave Antony .
The valiant Caesar
By Isis , I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men .
We did , my lord , weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer .
We hope to make the sender blush at it . Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour That may give furth rance to our expedition For we have now no thought in us but France , Save those to God , that run before our business . Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected , and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness add More feathers to our wings . For , God before , We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door . Therefore let every man now task his thought , That this fair action may on foot be brought .
Show me the place . I love to cope him in these sullen fits , For then he’s full of matter .
I’ll bring you to him straight .
By your most gracious pardon , I sing but after you .
My salad days , When I was green in judgment , cold in blood , To say as I said then . Get me ink and paper . He shall have every day a several greeting , Or I’ll unpeople Egypt .
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly . Heaven and earth , Must I remember Why , she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on , and yet , within a month Let me not think on ’t . Frailty , thy name is woman A little month , or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father’s body , Like Niobe , all tears . Why she , even she O God , a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourned longer married with my uncle , My father’s brother , but no more like my father Than I to Hercules . Within a month , Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes , She married . O most wicked speed , to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets It is not nor it cannot come to good , But break , my heart , for I must hold my tongue .
Hail to your lordship .
I cannot hear of any that did see her . The ladies , her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed , and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
I am glad to see you well . Horatio Or I do forget myself
The same , my lord , and your poor servant ever .
Sir , my good friend , I’ll change that name with you . And what make you from Wittenberg , Horatio Marcellus
My good lord .
Yea , my good lord . Those prisoners in your Highness name demanded , Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took , Were , as he says , not with such strength denied As is delivered to your Majesty Either envy , therefore , or misprison Is guilty of this fault , and not my son .
My liege , I did deny no prisoners . But I remember , when the fight was done , When I was dry with rage and extreme toil , Breathless and faint , leaning upon my sword , Came there a certain lord , neat , and trimly dressed , Fresh as a bridegroom , and his chin new reaped Showed like a stubble land at harvest home . He was perfumèd like a milliner , And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held A pouncet box , which ever and anon He gave his nose and took ’t away again , Who therewith angry , when it next came there , Took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked . And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by , He called them untaught knaves , unmannerly , To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility . With many holiday and lady terms He questioned me amongst the rest demanded My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf . I then , all smarting with my wounds being cold , To be so pestered with a popinjay , Out of my grief and my impatience Answered neglectingly I know not what He should , or he should not for he made me mad To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
My ladies both , good day to you .
Sweet madam .
I am glad to see your ladyship .
How do you both you are manifest house keepers . How does your little son
I thank your ladyship well , good madam .
He had rather see the swords , and hear a drum , than look upon his school master .
If the great gods be just , they shall assist The deeds of justest men .
Know , worthy Pompey , That what they do delay , they not deny .
O’ my word , the father’s son I’ll swear , ’tis a very pretty boy . O’ my troth , I looked upon him o’ Wednesday half an hour together has such a confirmed countenance . I saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it , he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes , and again catched it again or whether his fall enraged him , or how ’twas , he did so set his teeth and tear it O , I warrant it , how he mammocked it
Whiles we are suitors to their throne , decays The thing we sue for .
One on ’s father’s moods .
Indeed , la , ’tis a noble child .
We , ignorant of ourselves , Beg often our own harms , which the wise powers Deny us for our good , so find we profit By losing of our prayers .
A crack , madam .
I shall do well . The people love me , and the sea is mine . My powers are crescent , and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full . Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner , and will make No wars without doors . Caesar gets money where He loses hearts . Lepidus flatters both , Of both is flattered , but he neither loves , Nor either cares for him .
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field . A mighty strength they carry .
Where have you this ’Tis false .
Who’s there
What , my young master , O my gentle master , O my sweet master , O you memory Of old Sir Rowland Why , what make you here Why are you virtuous Why do people love you And wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke Your praise is come too swiftly home before you . Know you not , master , to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies No more do yours . Your virtues , gentle master , Are sanctified and holy traitors to you . Oh , what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it
Why , what’s the matter
O unhappy youth , Come not within these doors . Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives . Your brother no , no brother yet the son Yet not the son , I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises , and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie , And you within it . If he fail of that , He will have other means to cut you off . I overheard him and his practices . This is no place , this house is but a butchery . Abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
He dreams . I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony . But all the charms of love , Salt Cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip Let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both . Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , Keep his brain fuming . Epicurean cooks , Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite , That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor Even till a Lethe’d dulness
How now , Varrius
This is most certain that I shall deliver Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected . Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel .
I could have given less matter A better ear . Menas , I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm For such a petty war . His soldiership Is twice the other twain . But let us rear The higher our opinion , that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck The ne’er lust wearied Antony .
But what , in faith , make you from Wittenberg
A truant disposition , good my lord .
I would not hear your enemy say so , Nor shall you do mine ear that violence , To make it truster of your own report Against yourself . I know you are no truant . But what is your affair in Elsinore We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
My lord , I came to see your father’s funeral .
Indeed , my lord , it followed hard upon .
Thrift , thrift , Horatio The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables . Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day , Horatio . My father methinks I see my father .
Where , my lord
In my mind’s eye , Horatio .
I saw him once . He was a goodly king .
He was a man . Take him for all in all . I shall not look upon his like again .
Of guns , and drums , and wounds God save the mark And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth Was parmacety for an inward bruise , And that it was great pity , so it was , This villanous saltpeter should be digged Out of the bowels of the harmless earth , Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed So cowardly , and but for these vile guns He would himself have been a soldier . This bald unjointed chat of his , my lord , I answered indirectly , as I said , And I beseech you , let not his report Come current for an accusation Betwixt my love and your high Majesty .
Why , yet he doth deny his prisoners , But with proviso and exception That we at our own charge shall ransom straight His brother in law , the foolish Mortimer , Who , on my soul , hath willfully betrayed The lives of those that he did lead to fight Against that great magician , damned Glendower , Whose daughter , as we hear , the Earl of March Hath lately married . Shall our coffers then Be emptied to redeem a traitor home Shall we buy treason and indent with fears When they have lost and forfeited themselves No , on the barren mountains let him starve , For I shall never hold that man my friend Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost To ransom home revolted Mortimer .
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together . His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar . His brother warred upon him , although , I think , Not moved by Antony .
I know not , Menas , How lesser enmities may give way to greater . Were ’t not that we stand up against them all , ’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves , For they have entertainèd cause enough To draw their swords . But how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference , we yet not know . Be ’t as our gods will have ’t . It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands . Come , Menas .
Come , lay aside your stitchery I must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon .
No , good madam I will not out of doors .
Not out of doors
She shall , she shall .
Why , whither , Adam , wouldst thou have me go
Indeed , no , by your patience I’ll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars .
No matter whither , so you come not here .
Fie , you confine yourself most unreasonably come , you must go visit the good lady that lies in .
What , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food , Or with a base and boist rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road This I must do , or know not what to do . Yet this I will not do , do how I can . I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
Why , I pray you
But do not so . I have five hundred crowns , The thrifty hire I saved under your father , Which I did store to be my foster nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown . Take that , and He that doth the ravens feed , Yea , providently caters for the sparrow , Be comfort to my age . Here is the gold . All this I give you . Let me be your servant . Though I look old , yet I am strong and lusty , For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility . Therefore my age is as a lusty winter , Frosty but kindly . Let me go with you . I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities .
’Tis not to save labour , nor that I want love .
You would be another Penelope yet , they say , all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths . Come I would your cambric were sensible as your finger , that you might leave pricking it for pity . Come , you shall go with us .
No , good madam , pardon me indeed , I will not forth .
In truth , la , go with me and I’ll tell you excellent news of your husband .
Now all the youth of England are on fire , And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies . Now thrive the armorers , and honor’s thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man . They sell the pasture now to buy the horse , Following the mirror of all Christian kings With wingèd heels , as English Mercurys . For now sits Expectation in the air And hides a sword , from hilts unto the point , With crowns imperial , crowns and coronets Promised to Harry and his followers . The French , advised by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation , Shake in their fear , and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes . O England , model to thy inward greatness , Like little body with a mighty heart , What might’st thou do , that honor would thee do , Were all thy children kind and natural But see , thy fault France hath in thee found out , A nest of hollow bosoms , which he fills With treacherous crowns , and three corrupted men One , Richard , Earl of Cambridge , and the second , Henry , Lord Scroop of Masham , and the third , Sir Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland Have , for the gilt of France , Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France , And by their hands this grace of kings must die , If hell and treason hold their promises ,
O , good madam , there can be none yet .
Yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth Think’st thou I jest Hold , take thou that and that .
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you , Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours . When the sun shines , let foolish gnats make sport , But creep in crannies when he hides his beams . If you will jest with me , know my aspect , And fashion your demeanor to my looks , Or I will beat this method in your sconce .
Sconce call you it So you would leave battering , I had rather have it a head . An you use these blows long , I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too , or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders . But I pray , sir , why am I beaten
Dost thou not know
Good Enobarbus , ’tis a worthy deed , And shall become you well , to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech .
Nothing , sir , but that I am beaten .
Shall I tell you why
I shall entreat him To answer like himself . If Caesar move him , Let Antony look over Caesar’s head And speak as loud as Mars . By Jupiter , Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard , I would not shave ’t today .
Ay , sir , and wherefore , for they say every why hath a wherefore .
’Tis not a time for private stomaching .
Every time serves for the matter that is then born in ’t .
But small to greater matters must give way .
Not if the small come first .
Your speech is passion . But pray you stir No embers up . Here comes the noble Antony .
And yonder , Caesar .
If we compose well here , to Parthia . Hark , Ventidius .
O good old man , how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world , When service sweat for duty , not for meed . Thou art not for the fashion of these times , Where none will sweat but for promotion , And having that do choke their service up Even with the having . It is not so with thee . But , poor old man , thou prun’st a rotten tree That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry . But come thy ways . We’ll go along together , And ere we have thy youthful wages spent , We’ll light upon some settled low content .
My lord , I think I saw him yesternight .
Saw who
Master , go on , and I will follow thee To the last gasp , with truth and loyalty . From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here livèd I , but now live here no more . At seventeen years , many their fortunes seek , But at fourscore , it is too late a week . Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well , and not my master’s debtor .
My lord , the king your father .
The king my father
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear , till I may deliver , Upon the witness of these gentlemen , This marvel to you .
For God’s love , let me hear .
Two nights together had these gentlemen , Marcellus and Barnardo , on their watch , In the dead waste and middle of the night , Been thus encountered a figure like your father , Armed at point exactly , cap à pie , Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them . Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear surprisèd eyes Within his truncheon’s length , whilst they , distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear , Stand dumb and speak not to him . This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did , And I with them the third night kept the watch , Where as they had delivered , both in time , Form of the thing , each word made true and good The apparition comes . I knew your father . These hands are not more like .
Revolted Mortimer He never did fall off , my sovereign liege , But by the chance of war . To prove that true Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds , Those mouthèd wounds , which valiantly he took When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank In single opposition hand to hand He did confound the best part of an hour In changing hardiment with great Glendower . Three times they breathed , and three times did they drink , Upon agreement , of swift Severn’s flood , Who then , affrighted with their bloody looks , Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank , Bloodstainèd with these valiant combatants . Never did bare and rotten policy Color her working with such deadly wounds , Nor could the noble Mortimer Receive so many , and all willingly . Then let not him be slandered with revolt .
Thou dost belie him , Percy thou dost belie him . He never did encounter with Glendower . I tell thee , he durst as well have met the devil alone As Owen Glendower for an enemy . Art thou not ashamed But , sirrah , henceforth Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer . Send me your prisoners with the speediest means , Or you shall hear in such a kind from me As will displease you . My lord Northumberland , We license your departure with your son .
Noble friends , That which combined us was most great , and let not A leaner action rend us . What’s amiss , May it be gently heard . When we debate Our trivial difference loud , we do commit Murder in healing wounds . Then , noble partners , The rather for I earnestly beseech , Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms , Nor curstness grow to th’ matter .
’Tis spoken well . Were we before our armies , and to fight , I should do thus .
Welcome to Rome .
Thank you .
Sit .
Sit , sir .
We fortify in paper and in figures , Using the names of men instead of men , Like one that draws the model of a house Beyond his power to build it , who , half through , Gives o er and leaves his part created cost A naked subject to the weeping clouds And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny .
Nay , then .
I learn , you take things ill which are not so , Or being , concern you not .
What , is the King but five and twenty thousand
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little , I Should say myself offended , and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world more laughed at , that I should Once name you derogately , when to sound your name It not concerned me .
To us no more , nay , not so much , Lord Bardolph , For his divisions , as the times do brawl , Are in three heads one power against the French , And one against Glendower perforce a third Must take up us . So is the unfirm King In three divided , and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptiness .
That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreaded .
If he should do so , He leaves his back unarmed , the French and Welsh Baying him at the heels . Never fear that .
Who is it like should lead his forces hither
Indeed , madam
In earnest , it’s true I heard a senator speak it . Thus it is the Volsces have an army forth against whom Cominius the general is gone , with one part of our Roman power your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars . This is true , on mine honour and so , I pray , go with us .
Give me excuse , good madam I will obey you in every thing hereafter .
Let her alone , lady as she is now , she will but disease our better mirth .
In troth , I think she would . Fare you well , then . Come , good sweet lady . Prithee , Virgilia , turn thy solemness out o’ door and go along with us .
No , at a word , madam indeed , I must not . I wish you much mirth .
Well , then , farewell .
O Jupiter , how weary are my spirits
I care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel and to cry like a woman , but I must comfort the weaker vessel , as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat . Therefore courage , good Aliena .
I pray you bear with me . I cannot go no further .
For my part , I had rather bear with you than bear you . Yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you , for I think you have no money in your purse .
Ay , now am I in Arden , the more fool I . When I was at home I was in a better place , but travelers must be content .
Look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
How intend you , practiced
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me . Your wife and brother Made wars upon me , and their contestation Was theme for you . You were the word of war .
You do mistake your business . My brother never Did urge me in his act . I did inquire it , And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you . Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours , And make the wars alike against my stomach , Having alike your cause Of this my letters Before did satisfy you . If you’ll patch a quarrel , As matter whole you have to make it with , It must not be with this .
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me , but You patched up your excuses .
My lord , upon the platform where we watch .
Did you not speak to it
My lord , I did , But answer made it none . Yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion , like as it would speak . But even then the morning cock crew loud , And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanished from our sight .
Send us your prisoners , or you will hear of it .
An if the devil come and roar for them , I will not send them . I will after straight And tell him so , for I will ease my heart , Albeit I make a hazard of my head .
What , drunk with choler stay and pause awhile . Here comes your uncle .
Speak of Mortimer Zounds , I will speak of him , and let my soul Want mercy if I do not join with him . Yea , on his part I’ll empty all these veins And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust , But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer As high in the air as this unthankful King , As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke .
Brother , the King hath made your nephew mad .
Who struck this heat up after I was gone
He will forsooth have all my prisoners , And when I urged the ransom once again Of my wife’s brother , then his cheek looked pale , And on my face he turned an eye of death , Trembling even at the name of Mortimer .
Not so , not so . I know you could not lack , I am certain on ’t , Very necessity of this thought , that I , Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought , Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace . As for my wife , I would you had her spirit in such another . The third o’ th’ world is yours , which with a snaffle You may pace easy , but not such a wife .
So much uncurbable , her garboils , Caesar , Made out of her impatience which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet . For that you must But say I could not help it .
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria . You Did pocket up my letters and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience .
