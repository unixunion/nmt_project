What are you working on, my countrymen? Where are you going with bats and clubs? What’s the matter? Please tell me.
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
years into the space of a few hours. To that end, consider me a sort of chorus, here to help tell the story. And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly.
Quiet, shut up! It’s come again.
Looking just like the dead king.
You’re well-educated, Horatio. Say something to it.
Doesn’t he look like the king, Horatio?
Very much so. It’s terrifying.
It wants us to speak to it.
Ask it something, Horatio.
What are you, that you walk out so late at night, looking like the dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle? By God, I order you to speak.
The Senate knows what we’re upset about. They’ve known for two weeks what we intend to do, and now we’re going to show them. They say poor workers have bad breath. They’re about to find out that we have strong arms too.
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen? Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
Fortuneteller!
What can I do for you?
Masters, my good friends, my honest neighbors, why will you harm yourselves?
We’re already hurt.
Are you the man who knows the future?
I tell you, friends, the nobles take very good care of you. For the relief you want from your suffering, you’d do just as well to rise up against the heavens as against the Roman state. The Senate isn’t going to change its course. However strong a chain you form, the Senate will break you because it’s ten thousand times stronger. The gods, not the nobles, are responsible for whatever you lack, therefore you should fall to your knees and pray, not raise your arms and fight. You’re getting carried away by your calamity, and you’re only inviting more trouble. You’re slandering the senators, cursing them as your enemies, without realizing that they care for you like fathers care for their children.
Good morning, sir.
No news but the old news: the old Duke Senior has been banished by his younger brother, the new Duke Frederick. A few loyal lords have gone into exile with Duke Senior, and given up their lands and money to Frederick—so he’s happy enough to have them leave.
Give him your hand to read.
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
Oh, no. Duke Frederick’s daughter, Celia, grew up with Rosalind, and Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have either followed her into exile or died of grief. Rosalind has stayed at court, where Duke Frederick loves her like his own daughter. No two women ever loved each other like they do.
Bring the dessert in right away, and make sure there’s enough wine to toast Cleopatra’s health.
Where will the old duke live?
Kind sir, give me a good fortune.
They say he’s already in the Forest of Arden. He has many cheerful men with him, and they live like Robin Hood and his outlaws. People say that new batches of young men flock there every day, and that they all pass the time without a care, like people did in the Golden Age.
So, are you going to wrestle before the new duke tomorrow?
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Then see a good one for me.
Your beauty will be even greater than it is now.
He means I’ll get fat.
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.
May my wrinkles forbid that!
Quiet!
You will love more than you are loved.
My loyal, hard-working friend Sir Walter Blunt has arrived here at court, fresh off his horse and covered with the mud of every town from Holmedon to here. He’s brought us very welcome news. The Earl of Douglas has been defeated. Blunt saw ten thousand Scotsmen and twenty-two knights piled up in their own blood on the fields of Holmedon. Hotspur took these men prisoner: Douglas son Mordake, the Earl of Fife; as well as the Earls of Athol, Murray, Angus, and Menteith. That’s a valuable group! A fantastic catch, isn’t it, kinsman?
Truly, that’s a conquest to make even a prince brag.
No, keep going, old man; don’t stop like that. For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you.
Yes, and that makes me sad. Seeing Lord Northumberland with such a blessed son makes me commit the sin of envy. When honor speaks, it speaks about Hotspur. In a grove of trees, Hotspur stands straightest. He is the favorite darling of Fortune. When I see how he is praised, I can only see my own son, Harry, and his reputation for wildness and dishonor. If only it could be proven that a fairy had come to their cradles at night and switched them! Then the Percy family would have my Harry, and we Plantagenets would have Hotspur! But stop thinking about Harry now. Westmoreland, what do you make of young Percy’s arrogance? He says he’ll keep all the prisoners he captured for himself, and will only send me Mordrake, Earl of Fife.
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem. I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise. Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed. Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me. I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
Good news, God willing.
Well, I’ll listen sir, but don’t think you can trick us out of our suffering with a story. But if it pleases you, tell it.
As good as one could wish for. The King has been wounded and is near death. And, thanks to your son’s luck, Prince Harry has been killed. Douglas killed both Lords Blunt. Prince John of Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Stafford fled the battlefield. And your son captured that hulking Sir John Falstaff, Prince Harry’s fattened pig. Oh, there hasn’t been a battle so well fought or a victory so well won since the days of Julius Caesar! It brings honor to our times.
How do you know all this? Did you see the battlefield? Did you come from Shrewsbury?
I talked with someone, my lord, who was coming from there. He was a gentleman, with good breeding and a good reputation. He swore that all this was the truth.
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you. I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined. I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother. So use your discretion. I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger. And you’d better be careful, because if you embarrass him at all—in fact, if he doesn’t beat you thoroughly—he’ll come after you and won’t leave you alone till he’s poisoned you or trapped you—killed you, in other words, one way or another. It brings me to tears to say this, but there isn’t another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked. Because he’s my brother, I have to take his side. But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
I would rather get passion from drink than from love.
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune. Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them. Tell me I’ll have a child when I’m fifty who will be honored even by Herod of Judea. Let me marry Octavius Caesar and become my Queen’s equal.
You will outlive the Queen.
Oh, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
Here comes my servant, Travers. I sent him last Tuesday to find out what was happening.
You have already had better fortune than the future will bring.
Sir, I passed him on my way here. He doesn’t know anything more than what I told him.
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
Now Travers, what good news do you have?
Get out of here, you fool! Since you’re a fortuneteller I won’t bring charges of witchcraft against you.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
Never mind. Tell Iras’s fortune.
We’ll all want our fortune told.
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless. The two ships hadn’t come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle. As we were unjustly separated from each other, both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over. For her part–the poor soul! Her half of the mast weighed less, but she was no luckier than I was: the wind carried her away more quickly. I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinth–or so I thought. After a while, another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me. The sailors knew me, so they took good care of us. Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children, but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home. So now you’ve heard how I was separated from everything I love. It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.
There’s a palm that will predict a chaste life, if nothing else.
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
My youngest son, whom I care about the most, turned eighteen and started to wonder about his twin brother. He asked me to let him take his attendant–who had also lost a brother, though he had kept his brother’s
I’m very glad I came to see you. If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him. If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again. Farewell, my lord.
Take care, Charles.
My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign. Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
We have to think about that. If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work. Add to that a yearly sum of a thousand pounds to go directly into the king’s coffers. That’s what the bill says.
That would be quite a drain.
Now it’s time to get this playboy brother of mine all worked up. I hope I’ll see the end of him soon—I don’t know why, but I hate nothing in the world as much as him, though he’s an upstanding guy. He’s never gone to school but he’s smart, with good values, and everyone is delighted by him and loves him, especially my subjects, who know him the best. They love him, and therefore they despise me. But not for long; Charles will take care of everything. All I have to do is get Orlando to fight, which I’ll do now.
It would drain us dry.
But what can be done to prevent it?
The king is virtuous and kind.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
Well, sir, what did the belly answer?
Sir, I’ll tell you. With a disdainful smile—look, I can make the belly smile as well as speak—the belly tauntingly replied to the aggravated, mutinous parts that envied the food it received—much like you who rightly accuse our senators for not starving as you do.
What then? My word, you’re quite a speaker! What then? What then?
The greedy belly, the sink of the body, should be restrained—
Like the overflowing Nile predicts famine.
Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper. You can’t see the future.
And then what?
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear. Please, tell her an ordinary fortune.
Your fortunes are the same.
But how? How is that possible? Give me details.
I’ve said what I have to say.
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers? By an inch, even?
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Not in my husband’s nose.
His uncle Worcester put him up to that. It is just like Worcester to act against you in all ways. He’s the one making Hotspur behave like this, flaunting his youth in the face of your dignified age.
If the parts complained, what could the belly answer?
I’ll tell you. If you’ll exercise a little bit of what little patience you have, you’ll hear the belly’s answer.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts! Alexas! Come and tell his fortune. Let him marry a woman he can’t satisfy, dear Isis, I pray! And then let her die, and give him someone worse. Then let her die, and let her replacement be even worse. And so on until the last one, who is unfaithful with at least fifty other men and laughs at him until he dies. I beg you to grant my prayer, good Isis, even though it means you deny me something more important for myself. Good Isis, I beg you!
Look, it’s going away.
Amen, dear goddess. Listen to our prayer. If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful. Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
Stay! Speak! Speak! I order you, speak!
It’s gone. It won’t answer now.
