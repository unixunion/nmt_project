My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?
Well, my good lord. He heard of your Grace’s coming to town. There’s a letter for you.
What, thou meanest an officer?
As roughly as my modesty would let me.
What thing, in honor, had my father lost, That need to be revived and breathed in me? The King that loved him, as the state stood then, Was force perforce compelled to banish him, And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he, Being mounted and both rousèd in their seats, Their neighing coursers daring of the spur, Their armèd staves in charge, their beavers down, Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together, Then, then, when there was nothing could have stayed My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, O, when the King did throw his warder down— His own life hung upon the staff he threw— Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
I do not know, my lord.
We have scorched the snake, not killed it. She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave. After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well. Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him; His remedies are tame i’ the present peace And quietness of the people, which before Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends Blush that the world goes well, who rather had, Though they themselves did suffer by’t, behold Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see Our tradesmen with in their shops and going About their functions friendly.
How dost thou know that, constable?
So Brutus should be found.—I thank thee, Brutus, That thou hast proved Lucillius' saying true.
And so she doth, cousin.
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood. And I in fury hither followed them, Fair Helena in fancy following me.
Shall I not have barely my principal?
Nay, this was but his dream.
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see She is your treasure, she must have a husband, I must dance barefoot on her wedding day And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell. Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge.
Now let me see if I can conster it. Hic ibat Simois, I know you not, hic est Sigeia tellus, I trust you not, Hic steterat Priami, take heed he hear us not, regia, presume not, celsa senis, despair not.
Ay, Desdemona.
“With a trunk sleeve—”
A match! 'Tis done.
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer. Your master quits you, and for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding, And since you called me “master” for so long, Here is my hand. You shall from this time be Your master’s mistress.
