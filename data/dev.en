Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
Fine, sir. He heard you were coming to town. Here’s a letter for you.
You mean an officer?
I was as harsh as I could be while still being a lady.
What did my father lose that I now need to restore? Richard, the King at the time, loved my father, but given what was happening he had no choice but to banish him. And then, at Coventry, my father and Harry Bolingbroke met in a formal challenge. They were both mounted on their horses and ready to charge. Their horses were neighing, anxiously waiting for their riders' spurs to drive them forward. Their steel-tipped lances were ready for the attack. The visors of their helmets were down. Their eyes were on fire behind the steel slits. The trumpet sounded, and then—when there was nothing that could have stopped my father from killing Bolingbroke—the King prevented the fight by throwing down his royal scepter. That scepter was a symbol of his life; when he threw it down, he threw down his life and the lives of every man that has since died at war under the leadership of Bolingbroke.
I don’t know, father.
We have slashed the snake but not killed it. It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again. But the universe can fall apart, and heaven and earth crumble, before I’ll eat my meals in fear and spend my nights tossing and turning with these nightmares I’ve been having. I’d rather be dead than endure this endless mental torture and harrowing sleep deprivation. We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace. Duncan lies in his grave, through with life’s troubles, and he’s sleeping well. We have already done the worst we can do to him with our treason. After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.
We haven’t heard about him, so we don’t need to fear him. It would be easy to deal with him now, given the peace and quietness of the people, who were in such chaos before. Now we’re making his friends blush because things are going so smoothly. His friends are the ones who would’ve chosen—to their own detriment—to see people arguing in the streets rather than have our tradesmen back in their shops and happily doing their jobs.
How do you know that?
It’s fitting that Brutus be found like this. Thank you, Brutus, for proving my prediction true.
Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin.
My lord, the beautiful Helena told me about their secret plan to escape into this forest. I was furious and followed them here, and the lovely Helena was so in love with me that she followed me.
I won’t even get the original three thousand ducats back?
No, it was just a dream.
You mean you don’t even want to hear my side? Of course! She’s your treasure. She must have a husband and I must dance barefoot on her wedding day. You like her best and so I’ll die an old maid. Don’t talk to me. I’ll just go cry myself sick and think of some way to get back at all of you.
Now let me see if I can translate it. Hic ibat Simois, I don’t know you, hic est Sigeia tellus, I don’t trust you, Hic steterat Priami, don’t let him hear you, regia, don’t take anything for granted, celsa senis, don’t give up.
Yes, Desdemona.
“With a wide sleeve—”
Good! It’s a bet.
I accept that offer happily, madam. So you’re free now. I’m offering you my hand in marriage because of your loyal service to me, which was far from what any woman should be expected to do, especially a noble woman. You’ve called me “master” for so long. And now you’ll be your master’s mistress.
