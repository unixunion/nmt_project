Nay, but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front. His captain’s heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust.
Nay, I will. That’s flat! He said he would not ransom Mortimer, Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer.

Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other.
Withdraw yourself awhile. I’ll go with you.
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?

Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
O me unhappy!
